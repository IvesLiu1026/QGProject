**Transcript**:
Ethanol: this molecule, made of little 
more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient 
in alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it 
sneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects 
compared to other, clunkier molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically 
different effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol 
on its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach 
and is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract,
especially the small intestine. The contents of the stomach 
impact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because 
after eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach 
from the small intestine, closes. So the level of alcohol that reaches 
the blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that
from the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, 
alcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get 
the most blood flow: the liver and the brain. It hits the liver first, 
and enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule 
in two steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol 
into acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the 
toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood circulates, the liver 
eliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination 
determines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is responsible 
for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— 
otherwise known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s 
primary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, 
the neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons 
much less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, 
fall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity 
necessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol also stimulates 
a small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain 
to the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation. Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine 
in the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons 
to synthesize and release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down 
in response to stress or danger. Elevated levels of endorphins 
contribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated 
with alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol 
outpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences 
at any point in this journey can cause people 
to act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh 
the same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have 
different blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women 
tend to have less blood— women generally have 
a higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A smaller blood volume, 
carrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration 
will be higher for women. Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol
processing enzymes also influence BAC. And regular drinking can 
increase production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On the other hand, those who drink 
excessively for a long time may develop liver damage,
which has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences 
in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission 
may contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Those with naturally low endorphin 
or dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking. Some people have a higher risk 
for excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response 
that increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation 
in GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive 
to the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing 
disordered drinking. Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic 
alcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, 
and enhancing glutamate activity. This means regular drinkers tend 
to be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure. These structural and functional changes 
can lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, 
but not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So both genetics and previous experience 
impact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people 
are more prone to certain patterns 
of drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads 
to neural and behavioral changes.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 2: Where is most of the alcohol absorbed into the blood? Options: A. Stomach, B. Small intestine, C. Liver, D. Brain

Although this question does not directly ask what organ alcohol goes to first after being absorbed into the blood, it does mention the liver as an option and discusses the absorption of alcohol into the blood, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more relevant question that could match the ground truth MCQ is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose the most relevant question based on the content, I would suggest:

 Question 5 is not the correct match, however,  the most similar is  question 4, it talks about the liver enzyme, but question 5 discusses the general effects of the brain.

Upon re-examining the questions, I noticed question 5 has an option that says "liver sensitivity" this is not the correct answer but among the generated questions, question 5 has a mention of the liver.

But the correct match is not available, but if I had to choose I would say question 5, but a more correct match will be a question that asks "what organ does alcohol go to first after absorption" and the answer should be the liver.

But this is not available among the options.

after eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach 
from the small intestine, closes. So the level of alcohol that reaches 
the blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that
from the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, 
alcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get 
the most blood flow: the liver and the brain. It hits the liver first, 
and enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule 
in two steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol 
into acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the 
toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood circulates, the liver 
eliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination 
determines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is responsible 
for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— 
otherwise known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s 
primary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, 
the neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons 
much less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, 
fall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity 
necessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol also stimulates 
a small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain 
to the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation. Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine 
in the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons 
to synthesize and release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down 
in response to stress or danger. Elevated levels of endorphins 
contribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated 
with alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol 
outpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences 
at any point in this journey can cause people 
to act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh 
the same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have 
different blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women 
tend to have less blood— women generally have 
a higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A smaller blood volume, 
carrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration 
will be higher for women. Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol
processing enzymes also influence BAC. And regular drinking can 
increase production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On the other hand, those who drink 
excessively for a long time may develop liver damage,
which has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences 
in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission 
may contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Those with naturally low endorphin 
or dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking. Some people have a higher risk 
for excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response 
that increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation 
in GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive 
to the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing 
disordered drinking. Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic 
alcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, 
and enhancing glutamate activity. This means regular drinkers tend 
to be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure. These structural and functional changes 
can lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, 
but not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So both genetics and previous experience 
impact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people 
are more prone to certain patterns 
of drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads 
to neural and behavioral changes.

**Transcript**:
Ethanol: this molecule, made of little 
more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient 
in alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it 
sneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects 
compared to other, clunkier molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically 
different effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol 
on its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach 
and is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract,

**Transcript**:
In the depths 
of their underwater kingdom, the mighty Dragon Lords 
quaked with fear. Before them pranced Sun Wukong, 
the Monkey King. The legendary troublemaker been hatched 
from a stone, schooled in divine magic, and was currently brandishing 
the Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon. This magical staff, originally large enough to measure 
the depth of a great flood, now obeyed the Monkey King’s will 
and shrank at his touch. Terrified of this bewildering power, the Dragons graciously allowed 
Sun Wukong to keep the staff. The Monkey King stowed the weapon away, and gleefully sped back to his kingdom 
to show this treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys. After a lavish celebration, 
Sun Wukong fell into a deep sleep. But just as he began to dream, the Monkey King 
quickly realized two things. The first was that 
this was no ordinary slumber. The second was that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly, he found himself caught 
in the clutches of two grisly figures. At first the Monkey King didn’t know 
who his captors were. But as they dragged him toward 
their city’s gates, Sun Wukong realized 
his deathly predicament. These were soul collectors 
tasked with transporting mortals to the Realm of the Dead. This was the domain of the Death Lords, who mercilessly sorted souls 
and designed gruesome punishments. From here, the kingdom of death 
was laid out before him. He could see the Death Lord’s palaces, and the fabled bridge 
across the river Nai He. Manning the bridge was an old woman 
who offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits 
forgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world 
of the living in a new form. Further below were the souls 
not worthy of reincarnation. In this twisting maze of chambers, unfortunate spirits endured 
endless rooms of punishment— from mountains spiked with sharp blades, 
to pools of blood and vats of boiling oil. But Sun Wukong was not about to accept 
torture or reincarnation. As the soul collectors attempted to drag 
him through the gates, the Monkey King whipped out his staff 
and swung himself out of their clutches. His battle cries and the clang of weapons 
echoed throughout the underworld. Sensing a disturbance, 
the ten Death Lords swooped upon him. But they had never met such resistance 
from a mortal soul. What was this unusual creature? And was he a mortal, a god— 
or something else? The Lords consulted 
the Book of Death and Life— a tome which showed the time 
of every living soul’s death. Not knowing what category 
this strange being was under, the Death Lords struggled 
to find Sun Wukong at first; but the Monkey King 
knew just where to look. Unfortunately, the records confirmed 
the Death Lord’s claim— Sun Wukong was scheduled 
to die this very night. But the Monkey King was not afraid. This was far from the first time 
he’d defied destiny in his quest for wisdom and power. His past rebellions had earned him 
the power to transfigure his body, ride clouds at dizzying speeds, and govern
his tribe with magic and martial arts. In this crisis, 
he saw yet another opportunity. With a flash of his nimble fingers, the Monkey King struck 
his own name from the Book. Before the Death Lords could respond, he found the names of his monkey tribe 
and swept them away as well. Liberated from the bonds of death, Sun Wukong began to battle 
his way out of the underworld. He deftly defeated endless swarms 
of angry spirits— before tripping on his way 
out of the kingdom. Just before he hit the ground, 
Sun Wukong suddenly awoke in his bed. At first he thought the journey 
might have been a dream, but the Monkey King felt 
his new immortality surging from the top of his head 
to the tip of his tail. With a cry of triumph, he woke his 
warriors to share his latest adventure— and commence another round 
of celebration.

who offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits 
forgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world 
of the living in a new form. Further below were the souls 
not worthy of reincarnation. In this twisting maze of chambers, unfortunate spirits endured 
endless rooms of punishment— from mountains spiked with sharp blades, 
to pools of blood and vats of boiling oil. But Sun Wukong was not about to accept 
torture or reincarnation. As the soul collectors attempted to drag 
him through the gates, the Monkey King whipped out his staff 
and swung himself out of their clutches. His battle cries and the clang of weapons 
echoed throughout the underworld. Sensing a disturbance, 
the ten Death Lords swooped upon him. But they had never met such resistance 
from a mortal soul. What was this unusual creature? And was he a mortal, a god— 
or something else? The Lords consulted 
the Book of Death and Life— a tome which showed the time 
of every living soul’s death. Not knowing what category 
this strange being was under, the Death Lords struggled 
to find Sun Wukong at first; but the Monkey King 
knew just where to look. Unfortunately, the records confirmed 
the Death Lord’s claim— Sun Wukong was scheduled 
to die this very night. But the Monkey King was not afraid. This was far from the first time 
he’d defied destiny in his quest for wisdom and power. His past rebellions had earned him 
the power to transfigure his body, ride clouds at dizzying speeds, and govern
his tribe with magic and martial arts. In this crisis, 
he saw yet another opportunity. With a flash of his nimble fingers, the Monkey King struck 
his own name from the Book. Before the Death Lords could respond, he found the names of his monkey tribe 
and swept them away as well. Liberated from the bonds of death, Sun Wukong began to battle 
his way out of the underworld. He deftly defeated endless swarms 
of angry spirits— before tripping on his way 
out of the kingdom. Just before he hit the ground, 
Sun Wukong suddenly awoke in his bed. At first he thought the journey 
might have been a dream, but the Monkey King felt 
his new immortality surging from the top of his head 
to the tip of his tail. With a cry of triumph, he woke his 
warriors to share his latest adventure— and commence another round 
of celebration.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the Monkey King's powers, and the correct answer is "Commencing fire" as it is NOT one of his powers. 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is somewhat related to the Monkey King's powers, as it asks about what he used to escape the clutches of the soul collectors. However, it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match. However, if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 5 (Note: This is not a good match, but it's the closest among the generated MCQs)

**Transcript**:
In the depths 
of their underwater kingdom, the mighty Dragon Lords 
quaked with fear. Before them pranced Sun Wukong, 
the Monkey King. The legendary troublemaker been hatched 
from a stone, schooled in divine magic, and was currently brandishing 
the Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon. This magical staff, originally large enough to measure 
the depth of a great flood, now obeyed the Monkey King’s will 
and shrank at his touch. Terrified of this bewildering power, the Dragons graciously allowed 
Sun Wukong to keep the staff. The Monkey King stowed the weapon away, and gleefully sped back to his kingdom 
to show this treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys. After a lavish celebration, 
Sun Wukong fell into a deep sleep. But just as he began to dream, the Monkey King 
quickly realized two things. The first was that 
this was no ordinary slumber. The second was that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly, he found himself caught 
in the clutches of two grisly figures. At first the Monkey King didn’t know 
who his captors were. But as they dragged him toward 
their city’s gates, Sun Wukong realized 
his deathly predicament. These were soul collectors 
tasked with transporting mortals to the Realm of the Dead. This was the domain of the Death Lords, who mercilessly sorted souls 
and designed gruesome punishments. From here, the kingdom of death 
was laid out before him. He could see the Death Lord’s palaces, and the fabled bridge 
across the river Nai He. Manning the bridge was an old woman 
who offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What happened to the souls who drank the old woman's soup? However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar question is Question 3: What was the purpose of the old woman at the bridge across the river Nai He? Options: A. She punished unworthy souls, B. She guided souls to the Realm of the Dead, C. She offered worthy souls a bowl of soup to forget their previous life, D. She transported mortals to the underworld.

However, an even more similar generated MCQ would be one that directly asks what the old woman offered to the souls. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Considering the available options, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but it's not an exact match.

But then, looking at the options of Question 4, I see that option B says "They were reincarnated into a new form" and the passage says "After drinking, the spirits forgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world of the living in a new form." So, the passage does say that the souls were reincarnated after drinking the soup, but it doesn't directly say that in Question 3.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly asks what the spirits were offered on the bridge to forget about their past life.

In this case, I will choose the generated MCQ that has the closest information to the ground truth MCQ.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3

**Transcript**:
Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing
animal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're
going to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk
a little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the
word "conure"? If you thought "LOUD", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,
you're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you
can call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying
starts. The word "conure" is both an old term and
a new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for
a genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. "New World" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some
present-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,
which is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was
first introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference
in the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,
but what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--
both terms are correct. I call her Ecuador. Now Jenday conures are closely related to
Sun conures and they're very popular in the pet trade. But they are very very vocal. Oh! I soon discovered these birds were one of
the most neglected and re-homed groups in the animal rescue world. The more I learned about the individual personalities
of the birds that I got to rescue, my fascination with these overly exploited and underappreciated
group of birds grew. And the more I tried to define what a conure
was, the more complicated it seemed to get. So most people that see a bird with a curved
beak - you can do it-- oh! --and bright feathers say, "That's a parrot," and they're correct. So here's how it goes: all parrot-like birds
belong to the order Psittaciformes. But then there are families that break them
down into smaller groups. The three main families are Psittacidae, Psittaculidae
and Cacatuidae. The family Psittacidae includes birds like
macaws and parrots and conures and parakeets. The family Psittaculidae includes birds like
love birds and loris and other Old World parrots. And then the family Cacatuidae includes cockatoos
and cockatiels and others. So what makes a conure different form a parrot? Well they're not really different. They're just more specific. So, this is a parrot-- [bird squeals]. This is Zoe. She's a red-lored Amazon parrot, and you can
look at her-- [bird squawks] --and you can see that she has a very heavy body; and her
tail-- [bird says "pretty pretty pretty pretty"] --her tail is very squared at the bottom. Would you like another treat? No? Ok. But, then you look at-- [bird squawks] --at
Loulou, the half-moon conure, you can see he has a more slender body, and his tail is
tapered or cone-shaped. And you can see a big difference in [bird
squawks] not just their size, but the shape of their body. So if you look at Loulou and Ecuador, and
ignore the coloration on their feathers, just look at the characteristics on their body. Both of them have a hooked bill, curved in
a very similar way. They have long, tapered tails which are about
the same length as their body. They have short feet, and their toe arrangement
is zygodactyl, which is two toes in the front and two toes in the back. And if you look up at their eyes, they both
have a bare patch surrounding their eye. So the group of conures are made up of quite
a few different genera. The main two are Pyrrhura and Aratinga. These two are both in the Aratinga genus,
and Aratinga means "mini macaw." Speaking of, this, is a macaw! This is Joy, and she's a blue and gold macaw--
You so excited? --now you can see she's much larger than Lulu
and Equador, but she has similar characteristics in her body. You can see that she has almost a slender
body, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now
a macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet
and a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian
parrot. He can't be considered a conure even though
he has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,
and surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead
of a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,
instead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with
a green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek
conure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape
like that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World
so she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is
Psittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and
Ecuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he
is a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when
spread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced
lovebird. He's not a conure, and he's not a parakeet. He looks very similar to Sprinkles the parrotlet,
but he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not
belong to the family Psittacidae like Sprinkles does, but he belongs to the family Psittaculidae,
like Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's
a small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures
are parrots, but not all parrots are conures. All conures are parakeets, but not all parakeets
are conures. And all parakeets are parrots, but not all
parrots are parakeets. Make sense? If you have any questions about all of that
or anything else, you can find me on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook. You can find out all about animal wonders

**Transcript**:
Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing
animal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're
going to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk
a little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the
word "conure"? If you thought "LOUD", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,
you're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you
can call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying
starts. The word "conure" is both an old term and
a new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for
a genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. "New World" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some
present-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,
which is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was
first introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference
in the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,
but what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list.

However, Question 2 is somewhat related to aviculture as it discusses the classification of parrots, but it does not directly address the definition of aviculture.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that it is not present in the list, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 2, but with a very low confidence level.

But since it's not a direct match, I would recommend generating new MCQs that directly address the definition of aviculture.

Index: None (or 2 with a very low confidence level)

**Transcript**:
Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing
animal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're
going to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk
a little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the
word "conure"? If you thought "LOUD", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,
you're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you
can call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying
starts. The word "conure" is both an old term and
a new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for
a genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. "New World" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some
present-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,
which is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was
first introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference
in the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,
but what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--
both terms are correct. I call her Ecuador. Now Jenday conures are closely related to
Sun conures and they're very popular in the pet trade. But they are very very vocal. Oh! I soon discovered these birds were one of
the most neglected and re-homed groups in the animal rescue world. The more I learned about the individual personalities
of the birds that I got to rescue, my fascination with these overly exploited and underappreciated
group of birds grew. And the more I tried to define what a conure
was, the more complicated it seemed to get. So most people that see a bird with a curved
beak - you can do it-- oh! --and bright feathers say, "That's a parrot," and they're correct. So here's how it goes: all parrot-like birds
belong to the order Psittaciformes. But then there are families that break them
down into smaller groups. The three main families are Psittacidae, Psittaculidae
and Cacatuidae. The family Psittacidae includes birds like
macaws and parrots and conures and parakeets. The family Psittaculidae includes birds like
love birds and loris and other Old World parrots. And then the family Cacatuidae includes cockatoos
and cockatiels and others. So what makes a conure different form a parrot? Well they're not really different. They're just more specific. So, this is a parrot-- [bird squeals]. This is Zoe. She's a red-lored Amazon parrot, and you can
look at her-- [bird squawks] --and you can see that she has a very heavy body; and her
tail-- [bird says "pretty pretty pretty pretty"] --her tail is very squared at the bottom. Would you like another treat? No? Ok. But, then you look at-- [bird squawks] --at
Loulou, the half-moon conure, you can see he has a more slender body, and his tail is
tapered or cone-shaped. And you can see a big difference in [bird
squawks] not just their size, but the shape of their body. So if you look at Loulou and Ecuador, and
ignore the coloration on their feathers, just look at the characteristics on their body. Both of them have a hooked bill, curved in
a very similar way. They have long, tapered tails which are about
the same length as their body. They have short feet, and their toe arrangement
is zygodactyl, which is two toes in the front and two toes in the back. And if you look up at their eyes, they both
have a bare patch surrounding their eye. So the group of conures are made up of quite
a few different genera. The main two are Pyrrhura and Aratinga. These two are both in the Aratinga genus,
and Aratinga means "mini macaw." Speaking of, this, is a macaw! This is Joy, and she's a blue and gold macaw--
You so excited? --now you can see she's much larger than Lulu
and Equador, but she has similar characteristics in her body. You can see that she has almost a slender
body, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now
a macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet
and a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian
parrot. He can't be considered a conure even though
he has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,
and surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead
of a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,
instead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with
a green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek
conure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape
like that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World
so she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is
Psittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and
Ecuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he
is a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when
spread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced
lovebird. He's not a conure, and he's not a parakeet. He looks very similar to Sprinkles the parrotlet,
but he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not
belong to the family Psittacidae like Sprinkles does, but he belongs to the family Psittaculidae,
like Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's
a small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures
are parrots, but not all parrots are conures. All conures are parakeets, but not all parakeets
are conures. And all parakeets are parrots, but not all
parrots are parakeets. Make sense? If you have any questions about all of that
or anything else, you can find me on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook. You can find out all about animal wonders

**Transcript**:
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs." Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. "You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey." (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals
would look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process
works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default and ask, is there
a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser. So people hear about this study
and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative
to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light
for more than half a century. In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message
from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart
from the rest of us is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids
but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,
the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,
if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way
to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs." Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. "You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey." (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals

works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the list. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can identify a related generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the likelihood of failure when introducing a new product, specifically comparing the first-mover advantage to being a later entrant in the market.

While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 3 touches on the idea of challenging conventional wisdom, which is related to the concept of first-mover advantage. However, it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a direct match. Question 2 talks about the traits of "originals," which includes the idea of challenging conventional wisdom and taking a different approach, but it doesn't explicitly address the first-mover advantage.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will not provide an index. However, if you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals
would look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process
works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default and ask, is there
a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser. So people hear about this study
and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative
to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light
for more than half a century. In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message
from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart
from the rest of us is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids
but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,
the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,
if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way
to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs." Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. "You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey." (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing

I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging

**Transcript**:
It was one of the strangest trials 
in Dutch history. The defendant in this 1947 case 
was an art forger who had counterfeited millions of dollars 
worth of paintings. But he wasn’t arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving 
that he had committed the fraud. Like many art forgers, 
Han van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had failed 
to bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to make fools 
of his detractors. He learned all he could 
about the Old Masters— their biographies, their techniques, 
and their materials. The artist he chose for his deception 
was 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer 
was famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in secret for six years, 
the forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice. He mixed his own paints 
after researching the raw materials and pigments available in Vermeer’s time. He bought 17th century canvases, 
created his own brushes, and aged the works 
by applying synthetic resin and baking them to dry 
and crack the paint. A forensic test could have detected 
the synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests 
were neither advanced nor widespread, and even today verification 
of a painting’s authenticity relies on the assessment 
of art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective 
judgment— as well as their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren 
truly outwitted the art world. From his research, he knew historians 
believed Vermeer had an early period of religious painting influenced 
by the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, 
Abraham Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, 
though none of these works had surfaced. So van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it "The Supper at Emmaus." Bredius declared van Meegeren’s fake 
the masterpiece of Vermeer’s oeuvre. Van Meegeren’s forgery was not totally 
up to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these inconsistencies 
could be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced before 
the artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval 
from the art world, the fake was sold in 1937 
for the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The success prompted van Meegeren 
to forge and sell more works through various art dealers. As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe 
in their authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland 
during the Second World War, Hermann Göring, 
one of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer 
to his collection of artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him 
an alleged early Vermeer painting titled "Christ with the Adulteress." As the tide of the war turned, 
so did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was 
arrested for delivering a priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— 
an act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting 
wasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step 
how he had forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— 
the very expert who had enabled his scam. Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius 
defended the painting’s authenticity. With few options left, van Meegeren 
set to work on a "new" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to the court, 
they finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating 
with the Nazis— and sentenced to a year imprisonment 
for fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren 
did, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public 
that he had tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that 
of a folk hero who had swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable 
in their own right— so much so that they were later forged 
in turn by his own son. The same canvases went from 
revered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for the skill 
and notoriety of the forger.

**Transcript**:
It was one of the strangest trials 
in Dutch history. The defendant in this 1947 case 
was an art forger who had counterfeited millions of dollars 
worth of paintings. But he wasn’t arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving 
that he had committed the fraud. Like many art forgers, 
Han van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had failed 
to bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to make fools 
of his detractors. He learned all he could 
about the Old Masters— their biographies, their techniques, 
and their materials. The artist he chose for his deception 
was 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer 
was famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in secret for six years, 
the forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice. He mixed his own paints 
after researching the raw materials and pigments available in Vermeer’s time. He bought 17th century canvases, 
created his own brushes, and aged the works 
by applying synthetic resin and baking them to dry 
and crack the paint. A forensic test could have detected 
the synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests 
were neither advanced nor widespread, and even today verification 
of a painting’s authenticity relies on the assessment 
of art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective 
judgment— as well as their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren 
truly outwitted the art world. From his research, he knew historians 
believed Vermeer had an early period of religious painting influenced 
by the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, 
Abraham Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, 
though none of these works had surfaced. So van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it "The Supper at Emmaus." Bredius declared van Meegeren’s fake

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, Question 3 is the closest match because it mentions the fake Vermeer painting "The Supper at Emmaus", which is related to how van Meegeren set a trap for Vermeer expert Abraham Bredius.

But since it doesn't directly answer how van Meegeren set a trap, the correct answer would be "None" if the generated questions were the only options.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the information given in the transcript, I would say that the closest match would be a combination of Question 2 and Question 3, but since that is not an option, I will choose Question 3 as the closest match.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of theme and relevance.

The ground truth MCQ is about why most art forgers first turn to forgery, and the correct option is related to feeling unfulfilled by their original creations and seeking revenge.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly address this question. However, Question 6 comes closest in terms of theme, as it deals with Han van Meegeren's motivations and actions. But it's still not a direct match.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 6 is the closest, although it's still not a good match.

up to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these inconsistencies 
could be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced before 
the artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval 
from the art world, the fake was sold in 1937 
for the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The success prompted van Meegeren 
to forge and sell more works through various art dealers. As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe 
in their authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland 
during the Second World War, Hermann Göring, 
one of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer 
to his collection of artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him 
an alleged early Vermeer painting titled "Christ with the Adulteress." As the tide of the war turned, 
so did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was 
arrested for delivering a priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— 
an act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting 
wasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step 
how he had forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— 
the very expert who had enabled his scam. Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius 
defended the painting’s authenticity. With few options left, van Meegeren 
set to work on a "new" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to the court, 
they finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating 
with the Nazis— and sentenced to a year imprisonment 
for fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren 
did, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public 
that he had tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that 
of a folk hero who had swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable 
in their own right— so much so that they were later forged 
in turn by his own son. The same canvases went from 
revered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for the skill 
and notoriety of the forger.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to genetics and the concept of being an early bird or a night owl, while the generated MCQs are related to psychology and cover various topics such as psychoanalysis, brain function, learning theories, and research methods.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that specifically addresses the topic of genetics and its relation to being an early bird or a night owl.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say Question 3 is the most similar, but only because it mentions a theory, and the ground truth MCQ implies a theoretical explanation for being an early bird or a night owl. However, please note that this is a very weak connection, and the actual content of the two MCQs is quite different.

Index: 3 (with the caveat that this is a very weak connection and not a good match)

[ INTRO ] Squeaks and I are celebrating today. Because guess what? It’s almost National Coloring Day! [Squeaks cheers] National Coloring Day is just what it sounds
like: a day to color and have fun. And that’s exactly what we’re going to
do … with a special project. We’re going to make some invisible ink! That means the ink will disappear, and then
you can color over it to reveal a secret message. All you’ll need is baking soda, water, purple
grape juice, two cups, a cotton swab like a Q-tip, and either a paint brush or a cotton ball. Oh, and a piece of white paper to write on,
and a grown-up, of course! The first thing we’ll do is mix a quarter
of a cup of baking soda and a quarter of a cup of water. The measurements don’t need to be exact
— we’re just trying to make sure we have about
the same amount of each. This baking soda-water mixture will be our
ink! [Squeaks is surprised by how simple it is] Yep, that’s all there is to it! Let’s write something on this paper here. Hmmm … let me think of a secret message
for you, Squeaks … OK! Now all we have to do is wait for it to dry,
and the message will be hidden! It looks like the ink is dry, so the secret
message is ready to be revealed! The question is, are you ready, Squeaks? Let’s do it, then! This is what the grape juice is for. We’ll dip the brush into the grape juice,
and paint over the message. Check it out! Science is awesome That was the message! There are lots of ways to make invisible ink
at home, but this is one of the easiest — and, I think, the coolest! Because we’re doing the same thing lots
of scientists do in their labs every day! No, they’re not writing secret messages. But they do mix things together to learn more
about them, like we just did! The baking soda we used to make the invisible
ink is really a type of chemical called a base. And when we added the grape juice to the base
on the paper, they reacted to each other! That means they changed. When it touched the baking soda, a chemical
in the grape juice changed to become darker. That’s why the parts of the paper where
the message was got darker, and we were able to read it! Now, baking soda is a safe chemical, so we
can cook with it and use it for experiments at home, but scientists use it in their labs
sometimes, too. Actually, scientists use all kinds of bases
in their labs, and sometimes they need to be able to test
if a chemical is a base. To do that, they combine the chemical with
something called an indicator. That’s another chemical that scientists
know will change color if it mixes with a base. And guess what? One of the ingredients in grape juice works
as an indicator! It’s called an anthocyanin, and it becomes
a darker purple color when it touches a base. [Squeaks points out that grape juice is already
purple] That’s true, the grape juice is already
purple! But when it touches a base like baking soda,
it becomes a much darker purple. So that’s the scientific secret to our invisible
ink. And now we can write all the secret messages
to each other we want … as long as we have some grape juice on hand! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun
with Squeaks and me, hit the subscribe button, and don’t forget to check us out on the
YouTube Kids app. We’ll see you next time, here at the Fort! [ OUTRO ]

sometimes, too. Actually, scientists use all kinds of bases
in their labs, and sometimes they need to be able to test
if a chemical is a base. To do that, they combine the chemical with
something called an indicator. That’s another chemical that scientists
know will change color if it mixes with a base. And guess what? One of the ingredients in grape juice works
as an indicator! It’s called an anthocyanin, and it becomes
a darker purple color when it touches a base. [Squeaks points out that grape juice is already
purple] That’s true, the grape juice is already
purple! But when it touches a base like baking soda,
it becomes a much darker purple. So that’s the scientific secret to our invisible
ink. And now we can write all the secret messages
to each other we want … as long as we have some grape juice on hand! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

[ INTRO ] Squeaks and I are celebrating today. Because guess what? It’s almost National Coloring Day! [Squeaks cheers] National Coloring Day is just what it sounds
like: a day to color and have fun. And that’s exactly what we’re going to
do … with a special project. We’re going to make some invisible ink! That means the ink will disappear, and then
you can color over it to reveal a secret message. All you’ll need is baking soda, water, purple
grape juice, two cups, a cotton swab like a Q-tip, and either a paint brush or a cotton ball. Oh, and a piece of white paper to write on,
and a grown-up, of course! The first thing we’ll do is mix a quarter
of a cup of baking soda and a quarter of a cup of water. The measurements don’t need to be exact
— we’re just trying to make sure we have about
the same amount of each. This baking soda-water mixture will be our
ink! [Squeaks is surprised by how simple it is] Yep, that’s all there is to it! Let’s write something on this paper here. Hmmm … let me think of a secret message
for you, Squeaks … OK! Now all we have to do is wait for it to dry,
and the message will be hidden! It looks like the ink is dry, so the secret
message is ready to be revealed! The question is, are you ready, Squeaks? Let’s do it, then! This is what the grape juice is for. We’ll dip the brush into the grape juice,
and paint over the message. Check it out! Science is awesome That was the message! There are lots of ways to make invisible ink
at home, but this is one of the easiest — and, I think, the coolest! Because we’re doing the same thing lots
of scientists do in their labs every day! No, they’re not writing secret messages. But they do mix things together to learn more
about them, like we just did! The baking soda we used to make the invisible
ink is really a type of chemical called a base. And when we added the grape juice to the base
on the paper, they reacted to each other! That means they changed. When it touched the baking soda, a chemical
in the grape juice changed to become darker. That’s why the parts of the paper where
the message was got darker, and we were able to read it! Now, baking soda is a safe chemical, so we

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What is an indicator in chemistry? Options: A. A chemical that changes color when it mixes with a base, B. A chemical that changes color when it mixes with an acid, C. A chemical that remains the same color when it mixes with a base, D. A chemical that remains the same color when it mixes with an acid.

However, an even more similar generated MCQ is Question 8 and Question 9 in combination, but if I had to choose one it would be Question 7.

But the most similar one is actually Question 7 and Question 3. Question 7 is more similar in the sense of the definition of an indicator but question 3 is more similar in the context of the experiment.

However, I will choose Question 7 as the best match because the ground truth MCQ asks about what the grape juice is, and the correct answer is "an indicator". Question 7 asks what an indicator is in chemistry, which is more similar to the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, 
once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges 
from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. As the ruler of the city, 
you’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when 7 Leviathan Lords 
rose out of the roiling waters and surrounded your city. Each commands 10 giant kraken, and each kraken 
is accompanied by 12 mermites. Your city’s puny army 
is hopelessly outmatched. You think back to the legends. In the stories, the ruler of the city 
saved his people by feeding the creatures 
a ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally 
between the leviathans lords. Each leviathan would then divide its share
into 11 equal piles, keeping one, and giving the other 10 
to their kraken commanders. Each kraken would then divide its share 
into 13 equal piles, keeping one, and distributing the other 
twelve to their mermite minions. If any one of these divisions left 
an unequal pile or leftover pearl, the monsters would pull everyone 
to the bottom of the sea. Such was the fate 
of your fabled sister city. You rush to the ancient treasure room 
and find five chests, each containing a precisely counted number
of pearls prepared by your ancestors 
for exactly this purpose. Each of the chests bears a number 
telling how many pearls it contains. Unfortunately, the symbols they used 
to write digits 1,000 years ago have changed with time, and you don’t know how 
to read the ancient numbers. With hundreds of thousands of pearls 
in each chest, there’s no time to recount. One of these chests will save your city and the rest will lead 
to its certain doom. Which do you choose? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough information to decode
the ancient Atlantartican numeral system. But all hope is not lost, because there’s another piece 
of information those symbols contain: patterns. If we can find a matching pattern 
in arabic numerals, we can still pick the right chest. Let’s take stock of what we know. A quantity of pearls that can appease 
the sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Rather than trying out numbers 
at random, let’s examine ones that have this property and see if there are any 
patterns that unite them. Being divisible by 7, 11, and 13 means that our number must 
be a multiple of 7, 11, and 13. Those three numbers are all prime, 
so multiplying them together will give us their least 
common multiple: 1001. That’s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable 
offering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 1001. Let’s try multiplying it by a three digit 
number, just to get a feel for what we might get. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar 
with other examples. It’s a peculiar pattern. Why would multiplying a three-digit 
number by 1001 end up giving you two copies 
of that number, written one after the other? Breaking down the multiplication 
problem can give us the answer. 1001 times any number x is equal 
to 1000x + x. For example, 725 times 1000 is 725,000, 
and 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of 
those two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have 
that many thousands, plus one more. Even though you don’t know how 
to read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits 
represents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete
examples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look
abstract and mysterious. The monsters accept your ransom 
and swim back down to the depths for another thousand years. With the proper planning, that should give you plenty of time 
to prepare for their inevitable return.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that involves the sea monsters, the city, and the ransom.

If I had to choose from the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but it's still not similar to the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 asks about how the ruler determines which chest of pearls to choose, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about what is used to pay the ransom to the sea monsters.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the ransom or the object used to save the city. Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that aligns with the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

However, if I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose, it would be Question 8, with the understanding that it's not a close match.

Index: 8 (with the caveat that it's not a close match)

**Transcript**:
According to legend, 
once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges 
from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. As the ruler of the city, 
you’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when 7 Leviathan Lords 
rose out of the roiling waters and surrounded your city. Each commands 10 giant kraken, and each kraken 
is accompanied by 12 mermites. Your city’s puny army 
is hopelessly outmatched. You think back to the legends. In the stories, the ruler of the city 
saved his people by feeding the creatures 
a ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally 
between the leviathans lords. Each leviathan would then divide its share
into 11 equal piles, keeping one, and giving the other 10 
to their kraken commanders. Each kraken would then divide its share 
into 13 equal piles, keeping one, and distributing the other 
twelve to their mermite minions. If any one of these divisions left 
an unequal pile or leftover pearl, the monsters would pull everyone 
to the bottom of the sea. Such was the fate 
of your fabled sister city. You rush to the ancient treasure room 
and find five chests, each containing a precisely counted number
of pearls prepared by your ancestors 
for exactly this purpose. Each of the chests bears a number 
telling how many pearls it contains. Unfortunately, the symbols they used 
to write digits 1,000 years ago have changed with time, and you don’t know how 
to read the ancient numbers. With hundreds of thousands of pearls 
in each chest, there’s no time to recount. One of these chests will save your city and the rest will lead 
to its certain doom. Which do you choose? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough information to decode
the ancient Atlantartican numeral system. But all hope is not lost, because there’s another piece 
of information those symbols contain: patterns. If we can find a matching pattern 
in arabic numerals, we can still pick the right chest. Let’s take stock of what we know. A quantity of pearls that can appease 
the sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Rather than trying out numbers 
at random, let’s examine ones that have this property and see if there are any 
patterns that unite them. Being divisible by 7, 11, and 13 means that our number must 
be a multiple of 7, 11, and 13. Those three numbers are all prime, 
so multiplying them together will give us their least 
common multiple: 1001. That’s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable 
offering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 1001. Let’s try multiplying it by a three digit 
number, just to get a feel for what we might get. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar 
with other examples. It’s a peculiar pattern. Why would multiplying a three-digit 
number by 1001 end up giving you two copies 
of that number, written one after the other? Breaking down the multiplication 
problem can give us the answer. 1001 times any number x is equal 
to 1000x + x. For example, 725 times 1000 is 725,000, 
and 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of 
those two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have 
that many thousands, plus one more. Even though you don’t know how 
to read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits 
represents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete
examples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look
abstract and mysterious. The monsters accept your ransom 
and swim back down to the depths for another thousand years. With the proper planning, that should give you plenty of time 
to prepare for their inevitable return.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the question phrasing is not identical, both questions are asking about the number of Leviathan Lords. The ground truth MCQ asks how many Leviathan Lords the ransom should be divided between, while Question 2 asks how many Leviathan Lords rose out of the waters and surrounded the city. However, the context of the story implies that these are the same Leviathan Lords that the ransom will be divided between.

The options for Question 2 also match the options for the ground truth MCQ, with the correct answer being 7 (Option B) in both cases. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2.

and 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of 
those two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have 
that many thousands, plus one more. Even though you don’t know how 
to read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits 
represents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete
examples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look
abstract and mysterious. The monsters accept your ransom 
and swim back down to the depths for another thousand years. With the proper planning, that should give you plenty of time 
to prepare for their inevitable return.

**Transcript**:
Working in Vienna at the turn 
of the 20th century, he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline 
of psychoanalysis. He proposed that people are motivated 
by unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious 
through talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all 
other psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud 
right about human nature? And were his methods scientific? Order, order. 
Today on the stand we have… Dad? Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers
in the history of psychology. An egomaniac who propagated 
pseudoscientific theories. Well, which is it? He tackled issues medicine 
refused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called 
hysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken
seriously at all. From the women with depression 
he treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients 
forced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological 
disorders were real. He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced
that our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges 
and repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious 
or irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma 
survivors— and caused real harm. How’s that? He misrepresented some of his most 
famous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients 
when in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced 
by his theories coaxed their patients into "recovering" supposedly repressed memories 
of childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later
misapplications of his work— that would be projecting. Plenty of his ideas were harmful 
without any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality 
as a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life
by their lack of penises. Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space 
for future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques
that millions of people rely on came out of the work he started 
with psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows 
there’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. Psychologists today only believe 
in a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware 
of everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, 
ascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas
that were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought 
individual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance
of events in ancient history. And I mean ancient— 
like the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually 
believed these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase 
of cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally 
an echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these,
how can we take him seriously? Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical 
by today’s standards, but we can’t discount 
their influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator 
linking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk 
about our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? 
Defense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. But Freud didn’t present himself as a 
social theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. Are you saying he… repressed
inconvenient facts? Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable. Wait, so you’re saying he was right? No, his ideas were framed so that 
there’s no way to empirically verify them. Freud didn’t even necessarily believe 
in the psychoanalysis he was peddling. He was pessimistic 
about the impact of therapy. What! I think I need to lie down! Many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas 
don’t hold up to modern science, and his clinical practices don’t meet 
today’s ethical standards. At the same time, he sparked 
a revolution in psychology and society, and created a vocabulary 
for discussing emotion. Freud made his share of mistakes. But is a thinker responsible 
for how subsequent generations put their ideas to use? Do they deserve the blame, 
credit, or redemption when we put history on trial?

**Transcript**:
Working in Vienna at the turn 
of the 20th century, he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline 
of psychoanalysis. He proposed that people are motivated 
by unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious 
through talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all 
other psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud 
right about human nature? And were his methods scientific? Order, order. 
Today on the stand we have… Dad? Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers
in the history of psychology. An egomaniac who propagated 
pseudoscientific theories. Well, which is it? He tackled issues medicine 
refused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called 
hysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken
seriously at all. From the women with depression 
he treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients 
forced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological 
disorders were real. He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced
that our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges 
and repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious 
or irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma 
survivors— and caused real harm. How’s that? He misrepresented some of his most 
famous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients 
when in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced 
by his theories coaxed their patients into "recovering" supposedly repressed memories 
of childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later
misapplications of his work— that would be projecting. Plenty of his ideas were harmful 
without any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality 
as a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life
by their lack of penises. Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space 
for future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques
that millions of people rely on came out of the work he started 
with psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows 
there’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. Psychologists today only believe 
in a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware 
of everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, 
ascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas
that were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought 
individual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance
of events in ancient history. And I mean ancient— 
like the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually 
believed these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase 
of cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally 
an echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these,
how can we take him seriously? Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical 
by today’s standards, but we can’t discount 
their influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator 
linking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk 
about our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? 
Defense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. But Freud didn’t present himself as a 
social theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. Are you saying he… repressed

**Transcript**:
Flanked by two powerful European nations,
the English Channel has long been one of the world’s 
most important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores 
and stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's 
proposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands 
linked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended 
from floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice 
the length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured 
European imagination. The invention 
of the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer 
of chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel 
more feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles 
were ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation 
as a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion 
shut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered 
these worries obsolete, but new economic concerns 
arose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after 
the initial excavation, the two countries 
reached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed 
with private funding. In 1985, a group 
of French and British companies invested the modern equivalent 
of 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive 
infrastructure project to date. The design called 
for three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, 
one for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, 
emergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers 
of tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating 
from both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast 
revealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks 
let water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop 
waterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, 
and forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water 
flooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, 
the British had to use grout to seal the cracks 
created in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk 
about to be drilled. With these obstacles behind them, 
both teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons 
drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings 
to stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons 
following each machine. Even at top speed, 
work had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path 
between unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes 
made by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had 
to constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet 
within 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed 
satellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists 
who used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. During construction, 
the project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years 
of tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg 
emerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross 
the channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers 
and pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, 
cables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony 
marked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began 
16 months later, with trains for passengers 
and rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services 
over 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel 
in just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has 
the privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried 
to enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed 
the tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history 
can serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best 
when breaking down barriers.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the width of the English Channel, which is mentioned in the transcript as a 33-kilometer gap.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, which mentions the channel's rocky shores and stormy weather as a major challenge faced by engineers. However, it does not directly ask about the width of the English Channel.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the length or distance of the English Channel or the Channel Tunnel. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 5, which asks about the number of separate tunnels included in the design of the Channel Tunnel. This question is related to the Channel Tunnel's architecture, but it does not directly ask about the width of the English Channel.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or Question 5, if we consider a related question)

**Transcript**:
Flanked by two powerful European nations,
the English Channel has long been one of the world’s 
most important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores 
and stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's 
proposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands 
linked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended 
from floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice 
the length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured 
European imagination. The invention 
of the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer 
of chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel 
more feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles 
were ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation 
as a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion 
shut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered 
these worries obsolete, but new economic concerns 
arose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after 
the initial excavation, the two countries 
reached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed 
with private funding. In 1985, a group 
of French and British companies invested the modern equivalent 
of 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive 
infrastructure project to date. The design called 
for three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, 
one for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, 
emergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers 
of tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating 
from both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast 
revealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks 
let water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop 
waterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, 
and forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water 
flooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, 
the British had to use grout to seal the cracks 
created in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk 
about to be drilled. With these obstacles behind them, 
both teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons 
drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings 
to stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons 
following each machine. Even at top speed, 
work had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path 
between unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes 
made by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had 
to constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet 
within 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed 
satellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists 
who used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. During construction, 
the project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years 
of tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg 
emerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross 
the channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers 
and pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, 
cables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony 
marked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began 
16 months later, with trains for passengers 
and rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services 
over 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel 
in just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has 
the privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried 
to enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed 
the tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history 
can serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best

**Transcript**:
What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you. That's just how the media
has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage
about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans
say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk
to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you
who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says,
because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person
like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing
the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time
a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect
and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every
reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels. And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer. (Laughter) I later had a child,
after getting married, and I was living essentially
the Egyptian-American dream. And then that terrible morning
of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember
exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen
finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen
and see the words "Breaking News." There was smoke,
airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear, "... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca." Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions
had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day, we had to drive
across Middle America to move to a new city
to start grad school. And I remember sitting
in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town in what felt like
a completely different world. And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading warnings from national
Muslim organizations saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate." I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims
congregate for worship. And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target." And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home. And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people
who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually
saying things like, "There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques. They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether, and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense,
because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans,
aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes. Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find
about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off
from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group
can brainwash them into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people
going to the mosque. Now, some will still argue
Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS
bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can
to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in
to their narrative if we cast them as representatives
of a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them,
they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam
told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking
of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact
with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem
was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had
talked to had shut her down and said that her rage,
her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel
and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her
back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage --
instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque
prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia
affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought? Well, one study -- actually,
several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid,
at least three things happen. We become more accepting
of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects
were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting
of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights
of American Muslims. Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation
of a free society, which is rational
and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries
in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear
is harming us all. (Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having
to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor
were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school,
talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me
that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there
and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, "When did my baby brother
become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements
on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal. So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing
our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us. (Applause) I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose
courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose? What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that? Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those
who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people? Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims
around the world -- and I've done this, I've done
the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem
like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it. HW: Thank you so much.
Dalia Mogahed. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the percentage of negative news coverage about Islam and Muslims. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in terms of question intent and content, I would suggest Question 2: "What was the speaker's experience like after 9/11?" is not the closest, but Question 1 has a part of the speech that has the information of the percentage of news coverage about Islam and Muslims is negative.

But since it is not present, I will provide the index of the question that has the possibility of containing the information.
The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 12, Question 2
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you. That's just how the media
has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage
about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans
say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk
to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you
who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says,
because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person
like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing
the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time
a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect
and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every
reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels. And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer. (Laughter) I later had a child,
after getting married, and I was living essentially
the Egyptian-American dream. And then that terrible morning
of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember
exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen
finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen
and see the words "Breaking News." There was smoke,
airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear, "... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca." Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions
had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day, we had to drive
across Middle America to move to a new city
to start grad school. And I remember sitting
in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town in what felt like
a completely different world. And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading warnings from national
Muslim organizations saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate." I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims
congregate for worship. And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target." And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home. And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people
who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually
saying things like, "There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques. They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether, and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense,
because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans,
aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes. Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find
about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off
from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group
can brainwash them into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people
going to the mosque. Now, some will still argue
Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS
bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can
to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in
to their narrative if we cast them as representatives
of a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them,
they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam
told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking
of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact
with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem
was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had
talked to had shut her down and said that her rage,
her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel
and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her
back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage --
instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque
prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia
affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought? Well, one study -- actually,
several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid,
at least three things happen. We become more accepting
of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects
were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting
of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights
of American Muslims. Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation
of a free society, which is rational
and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries
in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear
is harming us all. (Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having
to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor
were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school,
talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me
that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there
and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, "When did my baby brother
become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements
on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal. So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing
our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us. (Applause) I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose
courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose? What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that? Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those
who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people? Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims
around the world -- and I've done this, I've done
the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem
like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it. HW: Thank you so much.
Dalia Mogahed. (Applause)

She disagrees and says that ISIS does not represent Islam., C. She says that Islam is a complex and multifaceted religion., D. She says that violence is a necessary part of Islam.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it addresses the speaker's response to the idea that Islam is a violent religion, which is the context in which the ground truth MCQ is presented. However, the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly compares ISIS to another group, similar to the Ku Klux Klan comparison in the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 4, with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Schizophrenia was first identified 
more than a century ago, but we still don’t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood 
and stigmatized illnesses today. So, let’s walk through what we do know— 
from symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass 
a number of related disorders that have similar symptoms 
but varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia 
has slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— 
subtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment 
of unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed 
after the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens 
or early twenties for men and the late twenties 
or early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature 
delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur 
in people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It’s a common misperception 
that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption 
of thought processes, rather than the manifestation 
of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced 
in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, 
expression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, 
like difficulty concentrating, remembering information, 
and making decisions. So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause,
but a combination of genetic and environmental 
risk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest 
genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people 
have schizophrenia, children or siblings of people 
with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin 
of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives 
of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits 
associated with the disorder— but not to an extent 
that requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly 
play a role, but we don’t know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure 
to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance 
that someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, 
including marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don’t affect 
everyone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure 
to environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate 
additional risk might tip the balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat 
schizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures 
of the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics 
block dopamine receptors. They can be very effective 
in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine 
in particular brain pathways. But the same drugs 
can make negative symptoms worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms 
of schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine 
in other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia 
show a loss of neural tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy 
is a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations 
of antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting 
multiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system 
is responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling 
throughout the brain and body, they can have other 
side effects like weight gain. In spite of these complications, 
antipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined 
with other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though 
it provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging 
as an effective treatment, especially when other options 
have failed. Early intervention 
is also extremely important. After months or years 
of untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded 
in someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma 
attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia 
are often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely 
to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce 
the likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, 
their families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma 
and improves access to treatment.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, I can infer that a generated MCQ related to the key neurotransmitter involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia would be the most similar.

From the transcript, we know that "Traditional antipsychotics block dopamine receptors. They can be very effective in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine in particular brain pathways."

Although there isn't a direct match among the provided generated MCQs, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of neurotransmitters, I would choose:

Question 6: What type of drugs can make negative symptoms of schizophrenia worse? Options: A. Traditional antipsychotics, B. Newer generations of antipsychotics, C. Antidepressants, D. Anti-anxiety medications 

However, please note that this is not a direct match, as it does not specifically ask about the key neurotransmitter involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

If I had to provide an index, I would say "6", but with the caveat that it's not a direct match. A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "Not explicitly listed".

**Transcript**:
Schizophrenia was first identified 
more than a century ago, but we still don’t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood 
and stigmatized illnesses today. So, let’s walk through what we do know— 
from symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass 
a number of related disorders that have similar symptoms 
but varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia 
has slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— 
subtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment 
of unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed 
after the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens 
or early twenties for men and the late twenties 
or early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature 
delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur 
in people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It’s a common misperception 
that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption 
of thought processes, rather than the manifestation 
of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced 
in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, 
expression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, 
like difficulty concentrating, remembering information, 
and making decisions. So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause,
but a combination of genetic and environmental 
risk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest 
genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people 
have schizophrenia, children or siblings of people 
with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin 
of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives 
of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits 
associated with the disorder— but not to an extent 
that requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly 
play a role, but we don’t know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure 
to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance 
that someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, 
including marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don’t affect 
everyone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure 
to environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate 
additional risk might tip the balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat 
schizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures 
of the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics 
block dopamine receptors. They can be very effective 
in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine 
in particular brain pathways. But the same drugs 
can make negative symptoms worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms 
of schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine 
in other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia 
show a loss of neural tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy 
is a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations 
of antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting 
multiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system 
is responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling 
throughout the brain and body, they can have other 
side effects like weight gain. In spite of these complications, 
antipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined 
with other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though 
it provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging 
as an effective treatment, especially when other options 
have failed. Early intervention 
is also extremely important. After months or years 
of untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded 
in someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma 
attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia 
are often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely 
to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce 
the likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, 
their families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma 
and improves access to treatment.

I want you to touch your face. Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right? You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true. You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers. You're feeling some of the fungi that drifted down
from the air ducts today. They set off our allergies and smell of mildew. You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin. They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body odor. You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes and sprayed onto you
with your last shower. Sorry. (Laughter) You're probably even giving
a microscopic high five to the two species of mites
that live on our faces, on all of our faces. They've spent the night
squirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose. (Laughter) Many of them are now leaking
their gut contents onto your pores. (Laughter) Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach? That's how you feel now, but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future. For the last 100 years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us. If I told you there was
a bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised
solution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect. We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now. But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology on this planet. The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems. I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us, and that's often in our most intimate
and boring environments, be it under our couches, in our backyards, or in our belly buttons. I do this work because it turns out
that we know very little about the microscopic life
that's nearest us. As of a few years ago,
no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms
live in your home -- your home, the place you know
better than anywhere else. And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA techniques to uncover the microscopic
life nearest us. In doing so, we found
over 600 species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny mites that cling to feathers. And we found over 100,000 species
of bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live
on our clothes or in our showers. We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies
of each of those bugs in our home. In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle
unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species. Behold the biological cosmos! So many of the species
you're looking at right now don't yet have names. Most of the life around us
remains unknown. I remember the first time I discovered
and got to name a new species. It was a fungus that lives
in the nest of a paper wasp. It's white and fluffy, and I named it "mucor nidicola," meaning in Latin that it lives
in the nest of another. This is a picture of it
growing on a dinosaur, because everyone
thinks dinosaurs are cool. At the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so excited
that I had found this new life form. I called up my dad, and I go, "Dad! I just discovered
a new microorganism species." And he laughed and he goes, "That's great. I hope you also
discovered a cure for it." (Laughter) "Cure it." Now, my dad is my biggest fan, so in that crushing moment where he wanted
to kill my new little life form, I realized that actually I had failed him, both as a daughter and a scientist. In my years toiling away in labs
and in people's backyards, investigating and cataloging
the microscopic life around us, I'd never made clear
my true mission to him. My goal is not to find technology to kill the new microscopic
life around us. My goal is to find new technology
from this life, that will help save us. The diversity of life in our homes is more
than a list of 100,000 new species. It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems. I know it's hard to believe
that anything that's so small or only has one cell can do anything powerful, but they can. These creatures
are microscopic alchemists, with the ability to transform
their environment with an arsenal of chemical tools. This means that they can live
anywhere on this planet, and they can eat whatever
food is around them. This means they can eat everything
from toxic waste to plastic, and they can produce waste products
like oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold. They can transform the inedible
into nutritive. They can make sugar into alcohol. They give chocolate its flavor, and soil the power to grow. I'm here to tell you that the next 100 years will feature
these microscopic creatures solving more of our problems. And we have a lot of problems
to choose from. We've got the mundane:
bad-smelling clothes or bland food. And we've got the monumental: disease, pollution, war. And so this is my mission: to not just catalog
the microscopic life around us, but to find out what it's uniquely
well-suited to help us with. Here's an example. We started with a pest, a wasp that lives on many of our homes. Inside that wasp, we plucked out
a little-known microorganism species with a unique ability: it could make beer. This is a trait that only
a few species on this planet have. In fact, all commercially produced
beer you've ever had likely came from one of only
three microorganism species. Yet our species, it could make
a beer that tasted like honey, and it could also make
a delightfully tart beer. In fact, this microorganism species
that lives in the belly of a wasp, it could make a valuable sour beer better than any other species
on this planet. There are now four species
that produce commercial beer. Where you used to see a pest, now think of tasting
your future favorite beer. As a second example, I worked with researchers
to dig in the dirt in people's backyards. There, we uncovered a microorganism
that could make novel antibiotics, antibiotics that can kill
the world's worst superbugs. This was an awesome thing to find, but here's the secret: for the last 60 years, most of the antibiotics on the market have come from similar soil bacteria. Every day, you and I
and everyone in this room and on this planet, are saved by similar soil bacteria
that produce most of our antibiotics. Where you used to see dirt, now think of medication. Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues who are studying
a pond scum microorganism, which is tragically named after
the cow dung it was first found in. It's pretty unremarkable
and would be unworthy of discussion, except that the researchers found
that if you feed it to mice, it vaccinates against PTSD. It vaccinates against fear. Where you used to see pond scum,
now think of hope. There are so many more microbial examples that I don't have time
to talk about today. I gave you examples of solutions
that came from just three species, but imagine what those other
100,000 species in your dust bunnies might be able to do. In the future, they might be able
to make you sexier or smarter or perhaps live longer. So I want you to look
at your finger again. Think about all those
microscopic creatures that are unknown. Think about in the future
what they might be able to do or make or whose life they might be able to save. How does your finger feel right now? A little bit powerful? That's because you're feeling the future. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the abilities of microbial species, and the correct option is "All of the above" (F), which includes breaking down plastic, creating battery power, making oil, making beer, and producing antibiotics.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the most similar, as it asks about a unique ability of a microorganism species found in the belly of a wasp, and one of the options is "It can make beer" (B). However, this question is not a perfect match, as it only asks about one specific ability and does not include the other options mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the various abilities of microbial species, similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 8, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
I want you to touch your face. Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right? You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true. You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers. You're feeling some of the fungi that drifted down
from the air ducts today. They set off our allergies and smell of mildew. You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin. They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body odor. You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes and sprayed onto you
with your last shower. Sorry. (Laughter) You're probably even giving
a microscopic high five to the two species of mites
that live on our faces, on all of our faces. They've spent the night
squirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose. (Laughter) Many of them are now leaking
their gut contents onto your pores. (Laughter) Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach? That's how you feel now, but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future. For the last 100 years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us. If I told you there was
a bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised
solution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect. We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now. But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology on this planet. The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems. I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us, and that's often in our most intimate
and boring environments, be it under our couches, in our backyards, or in our belly buttons. I do this work because it turns out
that we know very little about the microscopic life
that's nearest us. As of a few years ago,
no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms
live in your home -- your home, the place you know
better than anywhere else. And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA techniques to uncover the microscopic
life nearest us. In doing so, we found
over 600 species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny mites that cling to feathers. And we found over 100,000 species
of bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live
on our clothes or in our showers. We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies
of each of those bugs in our home. In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle
unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species. Behold the biological cosmos! So many of the species
you're looking at right now don't yet have names. Most of the life around us
remains unknown. I remember the first time I discovered
and got to name a new species. It was a fungus that lives
in the nest of a paper wasp. It's white and fluffy, and I named it "mucor nidicola," meaning in Latin that it lives
in the nest of another. This is a picture of it
growing on a dinosaur, because everyone
thinks dinosaurs are cool. At the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so excited
that I had found this new life form. I called up my dad, and I go, "Dad! I just discovered
a new microorganism species." And he laughed and he goes, "That's great. I hope you also
discovered a cure for it." (Laughter) "Cure it." Now, my dad is my biggest fan, so in that crushing moment where he wanted
to kill my new little life form, I realized that actually I had failed him, both as a daughter and a scientist. In my years toiling away in labs
and in people's backyards, investigating and cataloging
the microscopic life around us, I'd never made clear
my true mission to him. My goal is not to find technology to kill the new microscopic
life around us. My goal is to find new technology
from this life, that will help save us. The diversity of life in our homes is more
than a list of 100,000 new species. It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems. I know it's hard to believe
that anything that's so small or only has one cell can do anything powerful, but they can. These creatures
are microscopic alchemists, with the ability to transform
their environment with an arsenal of chemical tools. This means that they can live
anywhere on this planet, and they can eat whatever
food is around them. This means they can eat everything
from toxic waste to plastic, and they can produce waste products
like oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold. They can transform the inedible
into nutritive. They can make sugar into alcohol. They give chocolate its flavor, and soil the power to grow. I'm here to tell you that the next 100 years will feature
these microscopic creatures solving more of our problems. And we have a lot of problems
to choose from. We've got the mundane:
bad-smelling clothes or bland food. And we've got the monumental: disease, pollution, war. And so this is my mission: to not just catalog
the microscopic life around us, but to find out what it's uniquely
well-suited to help us with. Here's an example. We started with a pest, a wasp that lives on many of our homes. Inside that wasp, we plucked out
a little-known microorganism species with a unique ability: it could make beer. This is a trait that only
a few species on this planet have. In fact, all commercially produced
beer you've ever had likely came from one of only
three microorganism species. Yet our species, it could make
a beer that tasted like honey, and it could also make
a delightfully tart beer. In fact, this microorganism species
that lives in the belly of a wasp, it could make a valuable sour beer better than any other species
on this planet. There are now four species
that produce commercial beer. Where you used to see a pest, now think of tasting
your future favorite beer. As a second example, I worked with researchers
to dig in the dirt in people's backyards. There, we uncovered a microorganism
that could make novel antibiotics, antibiotics that can kill
the world's worst superbugs. This was an awesome thing to find, but here's the secret: for the last 60 years, most of the antibiotics on the market have come from similar soil bacteria. Every day, you and I
and everyone in this room and on this planet, are saved by similar soil bacteria
that produce most of our antibiotics. Where you used to see dirt, now think of medication. Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues who are studying
a pond scum microorganism, which is tragically named after
the cow dung it was first found in. It's pretty unremarkable
and would be unworthy of discussion, except that the researchers found
that if you feed it to mice, it vaccinates against PTSD. It vaccinates against fear. Where you used to see pond scum,
now think of hope. There are so many more microbial examples that I don't have time
to talk about today. I gave you examples of solutions
that came from just three species, but imagine what those other
100,000 species in your dust bunnies might be able to do. In the future, they might be able
to make you sexier or smarter or perhaps live longer. So I want you to look
at your finger again. Think about all those
microscopic creatures that are unknown. Think about in the future
what they might be able to do or make or whose life they might be able to save. How does your finger feel right now? A little bit powerful? That's because you're feeling the future. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
4,300 years ago 
in ancient Sumer, the most powerful person in the city of Ur
was banished to wander the vast desert. Her name was Enheduanna. She was the high priestess of the moon god
and history’s first known author. By the time of her exile, she had written 
42 hymns and three epic poems— and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her. Enheduanna lived 1,700 years 
before Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before 
the biblical patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land 
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities 
and high cultures. Her father was King Sargon the Great, 
history’s first empire builder, who conquered the independent city-states 
of Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite 
who spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south
viewed him as a foreign invader. They frequently revolted to regain 
their independence, fracturing his new dynasty. To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter, 
Enheduanna, as high priestess in the empire’s most important temple. Female royalty traditionally 
served religious roles, and she was educated to read 
and write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations. The world's first writing started in Sumer
as a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate 
over long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping 
developed into a script about 300 years 
before Enheduanna’s birth. This early writing style, 
called cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed 
into soft clay to make wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form 
of record keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable 
to individual writers. Enheduanna’s Ur was a city 
of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries, 
and irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna 
managed grain storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers, 
interpreted sacred dreams, and presided over the monthly 
new moon festival and rituals celebrating the equinoxes. Enheduanna set about unifying 
the older Sumerian culture with the newer Akkadian civilization. To accomplish this, 
she wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each Mesopotamian city 
was ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated 
to the ruling god of each major city. She praised the city’s temple, 
glorified the god’s attributes, and explained the god’s relationship 
to other deities within the pantheon. In her writing, 
she humanized the once aloof gods— now they suffered, fought, loved, 
and responded to human pleading. Enheduanna’s most valuable 
literary contribution was the poetry she wrote to Inanna, 
goddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy 
that gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms 
of sexual expression and was considered so powerful that 
she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could 
be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of 
the pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time 
an author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the first time writing is used 
to explore deep, private emotions. After the death of Enheduanna’s father, 
King Sargon, a general took advantage 
of the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family,
Enheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, 
the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising 
and restored his aunt as high priestess. In total, Enheduanna served 
as high priestess for 40 years. After her death, 
she became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied, 
and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems influenced 
the Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today, Enheduanna’s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have 
stood the test of time.

of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries, 
and irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna 
managed grain storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers, 
interpreted sacred dreams, and presided over the monthly 
new moon festival and rituals celebrating the equinoxes. Enheduanna set about unifying 
the older Sumerian culture with the newer Akkadian civilization. To accomplish this, 
she wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each Mesopotamian city 
was ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated 
to the ruling god of each major city. She praised the city’s temple, 
glorified the god’s attributes, and explained the god’s relationship 
to other deities within the pantheon. In her writing, 
she humanized the once aloof gods— now they suffered, fought, loved, 
and responded to human pleading. Enheduanna’s most valuable 
literary contribution was the poetry she wrote to Inanna, 
goddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy 
that gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms 
of sexual expression and was considered so powerful that 
she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could 
be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of 
the pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time 
an author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the first time writing is used 
to explore deep, private emotions. After the death of Enheduanna’s father, 
King Sargon, a general took advantage 
of the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family,
Enheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, 
the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising 
and restored his aunt as high priestess. In total, Enheduanna served 
as high priestess for 40 years. After her death, 
she became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied, 
and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems influenced 
the Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today, Enheduanna’s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have 
stood the test of time.

**Transcript**:
4,300 years ago 
in ancient Sumer, the most powerful person in the city of Ur
was banished to wander the vast desert. Her name was Enheduanna. She was the high priestess of the moon god
and history’s first known author. By the time of her exile, she had written 
42 hymns and three epic poems— and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her. Enheduanna lived 1,700 years 
before Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before 
the biblical patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land 
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities 
and high cultures. Her father was King Sargon the Great, 
history’s first empire builder, who conquered the independent city-states 
of Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite 
who spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south
viewed him as a foreign invader. They frequently revolted to regain 
their independence, fracturing his new dynasty. To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter, 
Enheduanna, as high priestess in the empire’s most important temple. Female royalty traditionally 
served religious roles, and she was educated to read 
and write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations. The world's first writing started in Sumer
as a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate 
over long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping 
developed into a script about 300 years 
before Enheduanna’s birth. This early writing style, 
called cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed 
into soft clay to make wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form 
of record keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable 
to individual writers. Enheduanna’s Ur was a city 
of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries,

**Transcript**:
In 1165, copies of a strange letter began 
to circulate throughout Western Europe. It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel 
and the Fountain of Youth— all ruled over by the letter’s 
mysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary
king never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom 
and its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European
leaders for the next 400 years. Prester John’s myth would propel 
the age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy, 
and indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, 
Europe was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what 
they regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith 
outside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim 
communities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian
kingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested
in rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous 
Muslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including
converted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory 
traveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled 
gaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced
with a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared 
the Crusader’s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by 
this so-called “Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author 
remains unknown, its stereotypes about the East 
and alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins 
as European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth 
was too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing 
the location of his mythical kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, 
European missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren’t searching for 
the letter’s author, who would have been over a century old; 
but rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John 
was briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols
were largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes 
to the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these explorers 
went south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors 
quickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted 
to Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland 
fit perfectly into Prester John’s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa 
for the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy 
finally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received 
their European guests, who were eager to do business 
with the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially 
confused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize 
the diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part 
of Prester John’s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced
an alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years after the European 
letter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership 
was quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported 
by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped 
Ethiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not 
the powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant 
Roman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect 
of Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert 
the people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, 
Ethiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John 
slowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made 
history despite having never existed.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the intent and topic, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar.

Question 3 discusses an event in the Far East that was misinterpreted and eventually led to the creation of the Prester John myth. Although it does not directly ask about the authorship of the Letter of Prester John, it touches on the idea that the myth was created due to misinterpretation and propaganda.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the authorship of the Letter of Prester John. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but I would like to emphasize that it is not a direct match.

as European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth 
was too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing 
the location of his mythical kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, 
European missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren’t searching for 
the letter’s author, who would have been over a century old; 
but rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John 
was briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols
were largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes 
to the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these explorers 
went south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors 
quickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted 
to Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland 
fit perfectly into Prester John’s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa 
for the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy 
finally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received 
their European guests, who were eager to do business 
with the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially 
confused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize 
the diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part 
of Prester John’s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced
an alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years after the European 
letter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership 
was quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported 
by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped 
Ethiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not 
the powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant 
Roman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect 
of Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert 
the people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, 
Ethiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John 
slowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made 
history despite having never existed.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6 and Question 2**: Although neither question is an exact match, they both touch on the location of Prester John's kingdom. Question 6 asks about the African country associated with the legend, while Question 2 asks about the supposed location of the kingdom according to the letter.

However, a more suitable match can be created by combining elements of multiple questions. 

If I had to choose one question that best matches the ground truth MCQ, I would choose **Question 2**. This question asks about the supposed location of Prester John's kingdom according to his letter, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

To create a more suitable match, I would suggest generating a new question that combines elements of Question 2, Question 5, and Question 6. This new question could ask about the various locations associated with Prester John's kingdom throughout history, with options that include Central Asia, Africa, and the Far East.

If I had to choose one question from the existing options, I would choose **Question 2**, with the understanding that it is not an exact match but rather the closest approximation.

**Transcript**:
In 1165, copies of a strange letter began 
to circulate throughout Western Europe. It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel 
and the Fountain of Youth— all ruled over by the letter’s 
mysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary
king never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom 
and its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European
leaders for the next 400 years. Prester John’s myth would propel 
the age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy, 
and indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, 
Europe was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what 
they regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith 
outside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim 
communities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian
kingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested
in rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous 
Muslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including
converted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory 
traveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled 
gaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced
with a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared 
the Crusader’s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by 
this so-called “Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author 
remains unknown, its stereotypes about the East 
and alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 4 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions focus on the European rulers' interest in Prester John and the potential benefits of forming an alliance with him. The correct option for Question 4 is not explicitly stated, but option D, "To form an alliance against Muslim armies," is closely related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ, which is "B. Retake Jerusalem." Both options imply that European rulers saw Prester John as a potential ally in their conflicts with Muslim forces.

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of neurons (brain cells) in each human brain. While none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific topic, Question 4 mentions the relationship between consciousness and intelligence, which is tangentially related to the brain and its functions.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of topic relevance, I would suggest:

**None of the above**

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:

**Question 6: According to the speaker, what is the role of the brain in perception?**

This question is not directly related to the number of neurons in the brain, but it does mention the brain and its functions, which is the closest match among the generated MCQs.

Please note that this is a weak match, and it's not a direct match. If you want a direct match, I would suggest generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body

how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've

inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines

about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory

is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain

are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences

around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences

of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: According to the speaker, what is the role of the brain in perception? Options: A. It passively receives sensory information, B. It actively generates the world we experience, C. It only processes visual information, D. It only processes auditory information**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that specifically addresses the checkerboard illusion and the brain's role in perceiving shadows.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of question intent and content, I would choose:

**Question 6**

However, I would like to note that the options in Question 6 do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ with options that specifically address the checkerboard illusion and the brain's role in perceiving shadows.

If I had to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create:

**Question: According to the speaker, why do we see the two patches as different shades of gray in the checkerboard illusion? Options: A. Because the brain "knows" that shadows make things appear darker, B. Because the brain "knows" that shadows make things appear lighter, C. Because the brain is tricked by the checkerboard pattern, D. Because the brain is not able to process visual information correctly**

This new MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping 
from tree branches. The writer blamed their deaths 
on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed 
on a nearby marsh. The letter was the push 
Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists 
and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide 
posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries 
through government contacts from her years working 
in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced 
the voices of spring?” In 1962, Carson published her findings 
in "Silent Spring." Her book documented 
the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature 
and human health. "Silent Spring" immediately drew both 
applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks 
on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist 
and writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her career 
as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology 
at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school 
before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father 
and sister. Carson found part time work 
with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program 
on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could 
hold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, 
and in 1936, she became the second woman 
to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published 
the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations
on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated 
with a wide audience. In "Silent Spring," 
Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions 
threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during 
World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers 
from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed 
in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants 
in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately,
but did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this and other mishaps, 
the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies 
extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public 
awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how 
the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution 
of resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development
of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time 
it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues 
of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT 
might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences 
for future generations. The response to "Silent Spring" 
was explosive. For many people the book 
was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson 
hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects 
posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture 
Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children 
was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson 
as “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer 
alluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” 
aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.” In reality, Carson had focused 
on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, 
while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief 
that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people 
to cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, 
but of ourselves.” Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after 
the publication of "Silent Spring." Her work galvanized a generation 
of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure 
from environmentalists, Congress passed 
the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate
environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created 
the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued 
a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson 
continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact 
of her writing.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it does relate to the criticism Carson faced after publishing "Silent Spring". The correct option of Question 7 (B) includes a quote from former Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, which implies that Carson was criticized for her work. This aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks why many people were critical of Carson and Silent Spring.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options.

**Transcript**:
In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping 
from tree branches. The writer blamed their deaths 
on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed 
on a nearby marsh. The letter was the push 
Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists 
and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide 
posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries 
through government contacts from her years working 
in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced 
the voices of spring?” In 1962, Carson published her findings 
in "Silent Spring." Her book documented 
the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature 
and human health. "Silent Spring" immediately drew both 
applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks 
on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist 
and writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her career 
as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology 
at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school 
before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father 
and sister. Carson found part time work 
with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program 
on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could 
hold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, 
and in 1936, she became the second woman 
to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published 
the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations
on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated 
with a wide audience. In "Silent Spring," 
Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions 
threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during 
World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers 
from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed 
in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants 
in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately,
but did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this and other mishaps, 
the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies 
extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public 
awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how 
the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution 
of resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development
of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time 
it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues 
of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT 
might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences 
for future generations. The response to "Silent Spring" 
was explosive. For many people the book 
was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson 
hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects 
posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture 
Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children 
was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson 
as “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer 
alluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” 
aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.” In reality, Carson had focused 
on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, 
while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief 
that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people 
to cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, 
but of ourselves.” Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after 
the publication of "Silent Spring." Her work galvanized a generation 
of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure 
from environmentalists, Congress passed 
the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate
environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created 
the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued 
a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson 
continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact 
of her writing.

**Question 8: What was the outcome of the attempt to eradicate fire ants in the southern U.S. using DDT?**

Options: A. It was successful in eliminating the ants, B. It killed wildlife indiscriminately, but did little to eliminate the ants, C. It had no impact on the environment or human health, D. It led to the evolution of resistant species

This generated MCQ is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions deal with the consequences of using pesticides (DDT) on insects. Although the ground truth MCQ asks about the general reaction of insects to heavy pesticide use, the generated MCQ (Question 8) specifically asks about the outcome of using DDT to eradicate fire ants, which is related to the concept of pesticide use and its effects on insects.

The correct option in the generated MCQ (Question 8) is B, which states that the attempt to eradicate fire ants using DDT "killed wildlife indiscriminately, but did little to eliminate the ants." This option is related to the concept of pesticide use leading to unforeseen results, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ's correct option B, "Through flarebacks requiring more powerful chemicals."

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

Antibiotics: behind the scenes, 
they enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything 
from surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are chemicals 
that prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria 
have become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, 
we’ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead 
of the problem. But first, how did we 
get into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic 
was penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize 
acceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance 
had the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria 
already began to appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies 
countered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful— 
and highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics 
were often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones 
had been broadly applicable. This isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses 
of these drugs could be sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, 
antibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections 
they had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, 
which is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, 
companies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood pressure 
and cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants 
and anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, 
these drugs more profitable. By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes 
of antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire 
resistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information 
between individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant 
to many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains 
are resistant to all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use 
of existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new 
and existing drugs, and find new ways to fight 
bacterial infections. The largest consumer 
of antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only 
to treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s exposure 
to the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity 
to develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals, 
like salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass 
to us through the food chain and spread through international trade 
and travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising 
new compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi 
have evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments— meaning they often contain 
antibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage 
over certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics 
with molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance 
is through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules
that block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria 
but don’t affect humans, are one promising new avenue 
to combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections,
meanwhile, can help prevent disease 
in the first place. The biggest challenge to all 
these approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate 
across the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable 
that many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies 
that successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt, 
like the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques 
like phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem 
as traditional antibiotics: if they’re working well, 
they’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance 
in the long term, we’ll need to use 
new antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits 
for their creators even further. One possible solution is to shift profits 
away from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom 
is testing a model where healthcare providers 
purchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways 
to incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still 
in the early stages. Countries around the world 
will need to do much more— but with enough investment 
in antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance.

of existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new 
and existing drugs, and find new ways to fight 
bacterial infections. The largest consumer 
of antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only 
to treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s exposure 
to the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity 
to develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals, 
like salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass 
to us through the food chain and spread through international trade 
and travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising 
new compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi 
have evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments— meaning they often contain 
antibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage 
over certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics 
with molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance 
is through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules
that block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria 
but don’t affect humans, are one promising new avenue 
to combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections,
meanwhile, can help prevent disease 
in the first place. The biggest challenge to all 
these approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate 
across the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable 
that many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies 
that successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt, 
like the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques 
like phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem 
as traditional antibiotics: if they’re working well, 
they’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance 
in the long term, we’ll need to use 
new antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits 
for their creators even further. One possible solution is to shift profits 
away from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom 
is testing a model where healthcare providers 
purchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways 
to incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still 
in the early stages. Countries around the world 
will need to do much more— but with enough investment 
in antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance.

Antibiotics: behind the scenes, 
they enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything 
from surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are chemicals 
that prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria 
have become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, 
we’ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead 
of the problem. But first, how did we 
get into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic 
was penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize 
acceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance 
had the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria 
already began to appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies 
countered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful— 
and highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics 
were often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones 
had been broadly applicable. This isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses 
of these drugs could be sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, 
antibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections 
they had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, 
which is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, 
companies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood pressure 
and cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants 
and anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, 
these drugs more profitable. By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes 
of antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire 
resistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information 
between individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant 
to many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains 
are resistant to all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use 
of existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new

**Transcript**:
In their ramshackle hut 
on the edge of the woods, a husband and wife were in despair. The woman had just given birth 
to their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly 
running out of food and money. The father walked into the woods 
to ponder their problem. After hours spent wandering 
through the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes. The first figure appeared 
to be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both figures offered to lighten 
the man’s burden, and act as Godfather 
to his most recent child. But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those 
who passed judgment on human life. He ventured deeper 
into the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest part of the woods, 
the father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face, 
which broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself, 
come to offer his services as Godfather. He promised to return 
when the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity. The father— knowing that all people 
are equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his offer. Years later, when the child had grown 
into an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather 
came for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand 
he held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask 
for his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion 
came with very strict rules. If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering 
at the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with 
just a waft of the antidote’s fumes. But if Death lingered 
at the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient 
as his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion 
and uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off 
the hardships of his early life. When the king fell ill, he summoned 
the famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, 
ready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death 
settled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory 
of saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around 
and reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free 
to administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson 
that if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor 
continued their travels. After some time, the king’s messengers 
came to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible 
riches to anyone who could cure her. The doctor approached the princesses’ 
chamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess, 
his greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice 
Death lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter 
her thanks, Death had dragged 
his lovesick Godson away. In an instant, 
the palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself 
in an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles,
each representing the duration of a life. As punishment for his Godson’s 
foolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle 
down to its wick. Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear 
he’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer 
his dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request— 
but the doctor’s betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip, 
and his Godson’s candle fell to the floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face 
fixed on the sputtering flame— until all that was left of the doctor 
was a wisp of smoke.

**Transcript**:
In their ramshackle hut 
on the edge of the woods, a husband and wife were in despair. The woman had just given birth 
to their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly 
running out of food and money. The father walked into the woods 
to ponder their problem. After hours spent wandering 
through the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes. The first figure appeared 
to be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both figures offered to lighten 
the man’s burden, and act as Godfather 
to his most recent child. But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those 
who passed judgment on human life. He ventured deeper 
into the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest part of the woods, 
the father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face, 
which broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself, 
come to offer his services as Godfather. He promised to return 
when the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity. The father— knowing that all people 
are equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his offer. Years later, when the child had grown 
into an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather 
came for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand 
he held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask 
for his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion 
came with very strict rules. If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering 
at the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with 
just a waft of the antidote’s fumes. But if Death lingered 
at the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient 
as his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion 
and uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off 
the hardships of his early life. When the king fell ill, he summoned 
the famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, 
ready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death 
settled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory 
of saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around 
and reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free 
to administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson 
that if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor 
continued their travels. After some time, the king’s messengers 
came to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible 
riches to anyone who could cure her. The doctor approached the princesses’ 
chamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess, 
his greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice

Question 4: What gift did Death give to his godson when he came of age? Options: A. A magical amulet, B. A flask containing the cure for all human ailments, C. A book of ancient knowledge, D. A set of healing tools

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the event of Death visiting his godson when he came of age. Although the options are not identical, option B in the generated MCQ mentions the flask containing the cure for all human ailments, which is related to Death's instruction to his godson to become a doctor.

However, a more direct match would be a question that asks about Death's instruction to his godson. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if we had to choose the most similar one, it would be Question 4.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What was the reason for the doctor's downfall when treating the princess? Options: A. He was too confident in his abilities., B. He was distracted by his love for the princess., C. He failed to notice Death's presence., D. He used the cure-all potion incorrectly.**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the doctor's actions when treating the princess. Although the question intent is not exactly the same, the context and the options are related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely in terms of question intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest.

But since the question is asking about what the doctor did when he saw the sleeping princess, a more accurate match would be a question that asks about the doctor's actions when he saw the princess. In this case, I would say that the correct match is not present among the generated MCQs.

However, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is:

**8**

Please note that this is not an exact match, but rather the closest match based on the available options.

as his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion 
and uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off 
the hardships of his early life. When the king fell ill, he summoned 
the famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, 
ready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death 
settled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory 
of saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around 
and reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free 
to administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson 
that if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor 
continued their travels. After some time, the king’s messengers 
came to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible 
riches to anyone who could cure her. The doctor approached the princesses’ 
chamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess, 
his greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice 
Death lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter 
her thanks, Death had dragged 
his lovesick Godson away. In an instant, 
the palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself 
in an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles,
each representing the duration of a life. As punishment for his Godson’s 
foolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle 
down to its wick. Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear 
he’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer 
his dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request— 
but the doctor’s betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip, 
and his Godson’s candle fell to the floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face 
fixed on the sputtering flame— until all that was left of the doctor 
was a wisp of smoke.

**Transcript**:
Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night 
tears across the stage. She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections 
from Mozart’s beloved opera, "The Magic Flute." The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars above 
the instruments. Its melody rings out 
across thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance 
from a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice
can be heard so clearly, above the strains 
of dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics 
of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique 
of an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house 
originates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin 
or the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, 
which our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number 
of waves per second–– is how our brains determine 
the pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination 
of multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating 
at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears 
mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers 
additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down 
into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them 
is how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of frequencies 
that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates 
at twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times 
the fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments 
produce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material
changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes 
the first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials 
resonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument
its unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability 
to stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly 
attuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an opera singer’s 
power of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard 
voice parts— can produce notes 
with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations 
per second. Human ears are most sensitive 
to frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 
vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out 
the partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot 
where she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition 
from the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker 
at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing 
these partials is a distinctive ringing timbre 
called a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades 
to create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension 
in their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position 
of their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones 
while dampening others. Singers also increase their range 
of partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note 
slightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound 
that rings out over the instruments’ 
comparatively narrow vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques 
to boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity 
and perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect 
sound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage 
of these techniques, but different vocal signatures 
demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs 
to build up stamina to power through the composer’s 
four-hour epics. While bel canto singers require 
versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible 
for every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall 
or a shower stall, these techniques can turn 
un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces.

the instruments. Its melody rings out 
across thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance 
from a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice
can be heard so clearly, above the strains 
of dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics 
of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique 
of an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house 
originates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin 
or the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, 
which our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number 
of waves per second–– is how our brains determine 
the pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination 
of multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating 
at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears 
mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers 
additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down 
into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them 
is how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of frequencies 
that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates 
at twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times 
the fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments 
produce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material
changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes 
the first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials 
resonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument
its unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability 
to stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly 
attuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an opera singer’s 
power of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard 
voice parts— can produce notes 
with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations 
per second. Human ears are most sensitive 
to frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 
vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out 
the partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot 
where she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition 
from the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker 
at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing 
these partials is a distinctive ringing timbre 
called a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades 
to create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension 
in their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position 
of their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones 
while dampening others. Singers also increase their range 
of partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note 
slightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound 
that rings out over the instruments’ 
comparatively narrow vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques 
to boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity 
and perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect 
sound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage 
of these techniques, but different vocal signatures 
demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs 
to build up stamina to power through the composer’s 
four-hour epics. While bel canto singers require 
versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible 
for every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall 
or a shower stall, these techniques can turn 
un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces.

**Transcript**:
Ethanol: this molecule, made of little 
more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient 
in alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it 
sneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects 
compared to other, clunkier molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically 
different effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol 
on its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach 
and is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract,
especially the small intestine. The contents of the stomach 
impact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because 
after eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach 
from the small intestine, closes. So the level of alcohol that reaches 
the blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that
from the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, 
alcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get 
the most blood flow: the liver and the brain. It hits the liver first, 
and enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule 
in two steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol 
into acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the 
toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood circulates, the liver 
eliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination 
determines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is responsible 
for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— 
otherwise known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s 
primary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, 
the neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons 
much less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, 
fall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity 
necessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol also stimulates 
a small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain 
to the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation. Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine 
in the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons 
to synthesize and release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down 
in response to stress or danger. Elevated levels of endorphins 
contribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated 
with alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol 
outpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences 
at any point in this journey can cause people 
to act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh 
the same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have 
different blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women 
tend to have less blood— women generally have 
a higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A smaller blood volume, 
carrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration 
will be higher for women. Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol
processing enzymes also influence BAC. And regular drinking can 
increase production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On the other hand, those who drink 
excessively for a long time may develop liver damage,
which has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences 
in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission 
may contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Those with naturally low endorphin 
or dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking. Some people have a higher risk 
for excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response 
that increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation 
in GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive 
to the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing 
disordered drinking. Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic 
alcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, 
and enhancing glutamate activity. This means regular drinkers tend 
to be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure. These structural and functional changes 
can lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, 
but not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So both genetics and previous experience 
impact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people 
are more prone to certain patterns 
of drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads 
to neural and behavioral changes.

**Transcript**:
Ethanol: this molecule, made of little 
more than a few carbon atoms, is responsible for drunkenness. Often simply referred to as alcohol, ethanol is the active ingredient 
in alcoholic beverages. Its simplicity helps it 
sneak across membranes and nestle into a many different nooks, producing a wide range of effects 
compared to other, clunkier molecules. So how exactly does it cause drunkenness, and why does it have dramatically 
different effects on different people? To answer these questions, we’ll need to follow alcohol 
on its journey through the body. Alcohol lands in the stomach 
and is absorbed into the blood through the digestive tract,
especially the small intestine. The contents of the stomach 
impact alcohol’s ability to get into the blood because 
after eating, the pyloric sphincter, which separates the stomach 
from the small intestine, closes. So the level of alcohol that reaches 
the blood after a big meal might only be a quarter that
from the same drink on an empty stomach. From the blood, 
alcohol goes to the organs, especially those that get 
the most blood flow: the liver and the brain. It hits the liver first, 
and enzymes in the liver break down the alcohol molecule 
in two steps. First, an enzyme called ADH turns alcohol 
into acetaldehyde, which is toxic. Then, an enzyme called ALDH converts the 
toxic acetaldehyde to non-toxic acetate. As the blood circulates, the liver 
eliminates alcohol continuously— but this first pass of elimination 
determines how much alcohol reaches the brain and other organs. Brain sensitivity is responsible 
for the emotional, cognitive, and behavioral effects of alcohol— 
otherwise known as drunkenness. Alcohol turns up the brain’s 
primary brake, the neurotransmitter GABA, and turns down its primary gas, 
the neurotransmitter glutamate. This makes neurons 
much less communicative, and users feel relaxed at moderate doses, 
fall asleep at higher doses, and can impede the brain activity 
necessary for survival at toxic doses. Alcohol also stimulates 
a small group of neurons that extends from the midbrain 
to the nucleus accumbens, a region important for motivation. Like all addictive drugs, it prompts a squirt of dopamine 
in the nucleus accumbens which gives users a surge of pleasure. Alcohol also causes some neurons 
to synthesize and release endorphins. Endorphins help us to calm down 
in response to stress or danger. Elevated levels of endorphins 
contribute to the euphoria and relaxation associated 
with alcohol consumption. Finally, as the liver’s breakdown of alcohol 
outpaces the brain’s absorption, drunkenness fades away. Individual differences 
at any point in this journey can cause people 
to act more or less drunk. For example, a man and a woman who weigh 
the same and drink the same amount during an identical meal will still have 
different blood alcohol concentrations, or BACs. This is because women 
tend to have less blood— women generally have 
a higher percentage of fat, which requires less blood than muscle. A smaller blood volume, 
carrying the same amount of alcohol, means the concentration 
will be higher for women. Genetic differences in the liver’s alcohol
processing enzymes also influence BAC. And regular drinking can 
increase production of these enzymes, contributing to tolerance. On the other hand, those who drink 
excessively for a long time may develop liver damage,
which has the opposite effect. Meanwhile, genetic differences 
in dopamine, GABA, and endorphin transmission 
may contribute to risk for developing an alcohol use disorder. Those with naturally low endorphin 
or dopamine levels may self-medicate through drinking. Some people have a higher risk 
for excessive drinking due to a sensitive endorphin response 
that increases the pleasurable effects of alcohol. Others have a variation 
in GABA transmission that makes them especially sensitive 
to the sedative effects of alcohol, which decreases their risk of developing 
disordered drinking. Meanwhile, the brain adapts to chronic 
alcohol consumption by reducing GABA, dopamine, and endorphin transmission, 
and enhancing glutamate activity. This means regular drinkers tend 
to be anxious, have trouble sleeping, and experience less pleasure. These structural and functional changes 
can lead to disordered use when drinking feels normal, 
but not drinking is uncomfortable, establishing a vicious cycle. So both genetics and previous experience 
impact how a person experiences alcohol— which means that some people 
are more prone to certain patterns 
of drinking than others, and a history of consumption leads 
to neural and behavioral changes.

**Transcript**:
In the depths 
of their underwater kingdom, the mighty Dragon Lords 
quaked with fear. Before them pranced Sun Wukong, 
the Monkey King. The legendary troublemaker been hatched 
from a stone, schooled in divine magic, and was currently brandishing 
the Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon. This magical staff, originally large enough to measure 
the depth of a great flood, now obeyed the Monkey King’s will 
and shrank at his touch. Terrified of this bewildering power, the Dragons graciously allowed 
Sun Wukong to keep the staff. The Monkey King stowed the weapon away, and gleefully sped back to his kingdom 
to show this treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys. After a lavish celebration, 
Sun Wukong fell into a deep sleep. But just as he began to dream, the Monkey King 
quickly realized two things. The first was that 
this was no ordinary slumber. The second was that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly, he found himself caught 
in the clutches of two grisly figures. At first the Monkey King didn’t know 
who his captors were. But as they dragged him toward 
their city’s gates, Sun Wukong realized 
his deathly predicament. These were soul collectors 
tasked with transporting mortals to the Realm of the Dead. This was the domain of the Death Lords, who mercilessly sorted souls 
and designed gruesome punishments. From here, the kingdom of death 
was laid out before him. He could see the Death Lord’s palaces, and the fabled bridge 
across the river Nai He. Manning the bridge was an old woman 
who offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits 
forgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world 
of the living in a new form. Further below were the souls 
not worthy of reincarnation. In this twisting maze of chambers, unfortunate spirits endured 
endless rooms of punishment— from mountains spiked with sharp blades, 
to pools of blood and vats of boiling oil. But Sun Wukong was not about to accept 
torture or reincarnation. As the soul collectors attempted to drag 
him through the gates, the Monkey King whipped out his staff 
and swung himself out of their clutches. His battle cries and the clang of weapons 
echoed throughout the underworld. Sensing a disturbance, 
the ten Death Lords swooped upon him. But they had never met such resistance 
from a mortal soul. What was this unusual creature? And was he a mortal, a god— 
or something else? The Lords consulted 
the Book of Death and Life— a tome which showed the time 
of every living soul’s death. Not knowing what category 
this strange being was under, the Death Lords struggled 
to find Sun Wukong at first; but the Monkey King 
knew just where to look. Unfortunately, the records confirmed 
the Death Lord’s claim— Sun Wukong was scheduled 
to die this very night. But the Monkey King was not afraid. This was far from the first time 
he’d defied destiny in his quest for wisdom and power. His past rebellions had earned him 
the power to transfigure his body, ride clouds at dizzying speeds, and govern
his tribe with magic and martial arts. In this crisis, 
he saw yet another opportunity. With a flash of his nimble fingers, the Monkey King struck 
his own name from the Book. Before the Death Lords could respond, he found the names of his monkey tribe 
and swept them away as well. Liberated from the bonds of death, Sun Wukong began to battle 
his way out of the underworld. He deftly defeated endless swarms 
of angry spirits— before tripping on his way 
out of the kingdom. Just before he hit the ground, 
Sun Wukong suddenly awoke in his bed. At first he thought the journey 
might have been a dream, but the Monkey King felt 
his new immortality surging from the top of his head 
to the tip of his tail. With a cry of triumph, he woke his 
warriors to share his latest adventure— and commence another round 
of celebration.

him through the gates, the Monkey King whipped out his staff 
and swung himself out of their clutches. His battle cries and the clang of weapons 
echoed throughout the underworld. Sensing a disturbance, 
the ten Death Lords swooped upon him. But they had never met such resistance 
from a mortal soul. What was this unusual creature? And was he a mortal, a god— 
or something else? The Lords consulted 
the Book of Death and Life— a tome which showed the time 
of every living soul’s death. Not knowing what category 
this strange being was under, the Death Lords struggled 
to find Sun Wukong at first; but the Monkey King 
knew just where to look. Unfortunately, the records confirmed 
the Death Lord’s claim— Sun Wukong was scheduled 
to die this very night. But the Monkey King was not afraid. This was far from the first time 
he’d defied destiny in his quest for wisdom and power. His past rebellions had earned him 
the power to transfigure his body, ride clouds at dizzying speeds, and govern
his tribe with magic and martial arts. In this crisis, 
he saw yet another opportunity. With a flash of his nimble fingers, the Monkey King struck 
his own name from the Book. Before the Death Lords could respond, he found the names of his monkey tribe 
and swept them away as well. Liberated from the bonds of death, Sun Wukong began to battle 
his way out of the underworld. He deftly defeated endless swarms 
of angry spirits— before tripping on his way 
out of the kingdom. Just before he hit the ground, 
Sun Wukong suddenly awoke in his bed. At first he thought the journey 
might have been a dream, but the Monkey King felt 
his new immortality surging from the top of his head 
to the tip of his tail. With a cry of triumph, he woke his 
warriors to share his latest adventure— and commence another round 
of celebration.

**Transcript**:
In the depths 
of their underwater kingdom, the mighty Dragon Lords 
quaked with fear. Before them pranced Sun Wukong, 
the Monkey King. The legendary troublemaker been hatched 
from a stone, schooled in divine magic, and was currently brandishing 
the Dragon Lord’s most treasured weapon. This magical staff, originally large enough to measure 
the depth of a great flood, now obeyed the Monkey King’s will 
and shrank at his touch. Terrified of this bewildering power, the Dragons graciously allowed 
Sun Wukong to keep the staff. The Monkey King stowed the weapon away, and gleefully sped back to his kingdom 
to show this treasure to his tribe of warrior monkeys. After a lavish celebration, 
Sun Wukong fell into a deep sleep. But just as he began to dream, the Monkey King 
quickly realized two things. The first was that 
this was no ordinary slumber. The second was that he wasn’t alone. Suddenly, he found himself caught 
in the clutches of two grisly figures. At first the Monkey King didn’t know 
who his captors were. But as they dragged him toward 
their city’s gates, Sun Wukong realized 
his deathly predicament. These were soul collectors 
tasked with transporting mortals to the Realm of the Dead. This was the domain of the Death Lords, who mercilessly sorted souls 
and designed gruesome punishments. From here, the kingdom of death 
was laid out before him. He could see the Death Lord’s palaces, and the fabled bridge 
across the river Nai He. Manning the bridge was an old woman 
who offered worthy souls a bowl of soup. After drinking, the spirits 
forgot their previous life, and were sent back to the world 
of the living in a new form. Further below were the souls 
not worthy of reincarnation. In this twisting maze of chambers, unfortunate spirits endured 
endless rooms of punishment— from mountains spiked with sharp blades, 
to pools of blood and vats of boiling oil. But Sun Wukong was not about to accept 
torture or reincarnation. As the soul collectors attempted to drag

**Transcript**:
Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing
animal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're
going to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk
a little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the
word "conure"? If you thought "LOUD", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,
you're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you
can call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying
starts. The word "conure" is both an old term and
a new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for
a genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. "New World" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some
present-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,
which is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was
first introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference
in the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,
but what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--
both terms are correct. I call her Ecuador. Now Jenday conures are closely related to
Sun conures and they're very popular in the pet trade. But they are very very vocal. Oh! I soon discovered these birds were one of
the most neglected and re-homed groups in the animal rescue world. The more I learned about the individual personalities
of the birds that I got to rescue, my fascination with these overly exploited and underappreciated
group of birds grew. And the more I tried to define what a conure
was, the more complicated it seemed to get. So most people that see a bird with a curved
beak - you can do it-- oh! --and bright feathers say, "That's a parrot," and they're correct. So here's how it goes: all parrot-like birds
belong to the order Psittaciformes. But then there are families that break them
down into smaller groups. The three main families are Psittacidae, Psittaculidae
and Cacatuidae. The family Psittacidae includes birds like
macaws and parrots and conures and parakeets. The family Psittaculidae includes birds like
love birds and loris and other Old World parrots. And then the family Cacatuidae includes cockatoos
and cockatiels and others. So what makes a conure different form a parrot? Well they're not really different. They're just more specific. So, this is a parrot-- [bird squeals]. This is Zoe. She's a red-lored Amazon parrot, and you can
look at her-- [bird squawks] --and you can see that she has a very heavy body; and her
tail-- [bird says "pretty pretty pretty pretty"] --her tail is very squared at the bottom. Would you like another treat? No? Ok. But, then you look at-- [bird squawks] --at
Loulou, the half-moon conure, you can see he has a more slender body, and his tail is
tapered or cone-shaped. And you can see a big difference in [bird
squawks] not just their size, but the shape of their body. So if you look at Loulou and Ecuador, and
ignore the coloration on their feathers, just look at the characteristics on their body. Both of them have a hooked bill, curved in
a very similar way. They have long, tapered tails which are about
the same length as their body. They have short feet, and their toe arrangement
is zygodactyl, which is two toes in the front and two toes in the back. And if you look up at their eyes, they both
have a bare patch surrounding their eye. So the group of conures are made up of quite
a few different genera. The main two are Pyrrhura and Aratinga. These two are both in the Aratinga genus,
and Aratinga means "mini macaw." Speaking of, this, is a macaw! This is Joy, and she's a blue and gold macaw--
You so excited? --now you can see she's much larger than Lulu
and Equador, but she has similar characteristics in her body. You can see that she has almost a slender
body, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now
a macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet
and a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian
parrot. He can't be considered a conure even though
he has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,
and surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead
of a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,
instead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with
a green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek
conure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape
like that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World
so she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is
Psittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and
Ecuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he
is a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when
spread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced
lovebird. He's not a conure, and he's not a parakeet. He looks very similar to Sprinkles the parrotlet,
but he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not
belong to the family Psittacidae like Sprinkles does, but he belongs to the family Psittaculidae,
like Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's
a small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures
are parrots, but not all parrots are conures. All conures are parakeets, but not all parakeets
are conures. And all parakeets are parrots, but not all
parrots are parakeets. Make sense? If you have any questions about all of that

**Transcript**:
Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing
animal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're
going to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk
a little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the
word "conure"? If you thought "LOUD", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,
you're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you
can call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying
starts. The word "conure" is both an old term and
a new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for
a genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. "New World" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some
present-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,
which is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was
first introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference
in the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,
but what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--
both terms are correct. I call her Ecuador. Now Jenday conures are closely related to
Sun conures and they're very popular in the pet trade. But they are very very vocal. Oh! I soon discovered these birds were one of
the most neglected and re-homed groups in the animal rescue world. The more I learned about the individual personalities
of the birds that I got to rescue, my fascination with these overly exploited and underappreciated
group of birds grew. And the more I tried to define what a conure
was, the more complicated it seemed to get. So most people that see a bird with a curved
beak - you can do it-- oh! --and bright feathers say, "That's a parrot," and they're correct. So here's how it goes: all parrot-like birds
belong to the order Psittaciformes. But then there are families that break them
down into smaller groups. The three main families are Psittacidae, Psittaculidae
and Cacatuidae. The family Psittacidae includes birds like
macaws and parrots and conures and parakeets. The family Psittaculidae includes birds like
love birds and loris and other Old World parrots. And then the family Cacatuidae includes cockatoos
and cockatiels and others. So what makes a conure different form a parrot? Well they're not really different. They're just more specific. So, this is a parrot-- [bird squeals]. This is Zoe. She's a red-lored Amazon parrot, and you can
look at her-- [bird squawks] --and you can see that she has a very heavy body; and her
tail-- [bird says "pretty pretty pretty pretty"] --her tail is very squared at the bottom. Would you like another treat? No? Ok. But, then you look at-- [bird squawks] --at
Loulou, the half-moon conure, you can see he has a more slender body, and his tail is
tapered or cone-shaped. And you can see a big difference in [bird
squawks] not just their size, but the shape of their body. So if you look at Loulou and Ecuador, and
ignore the coloration on their feathers, just look at the characteristics on their body. Both of them have a hooked bill, curved in
a very similar way. They have long, tapered tails which are about
the same length as their body. They have short feet, and their toe arrangement
is zygodactyl, which is two toes in the front and two toes in the back. And if you look up at their eyes, they both
have a bare patch surrounding their eye. So the group of conures are made up of quite
a few different genera. The main two are Pyrrhura and Aratinga. These two are both in the Aratinga genus,
and Aratinga means "mini macaw." Speaking of, this, is a macaw! This is Joy, and she's a blue and gold macaw--
You so excited? --now you can see she's much larger than Lulu
and Equador, but she has similar characteristics in her body. You can see that she has almost a slender
body, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now
a macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet
and a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian
parrot. He can't be considered a conure even though
he has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,
and surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead
of a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,
instead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with
a green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek
conure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape
like that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World
so she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is
Psittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and
Ecuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he
is a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when
spread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced

but he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not
belong to the family Psittacidae like Sprinkles does, but he belongs to the family Psittaculidae,
like Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's
a small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures

body, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now
a macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet
and a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian
parrot. He can't be considered a conure even though
he has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,
and surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead
of a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,
instead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with
a green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek
conure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape
like that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World
so she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is
Psittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and
Ecuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he
is a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when
spread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced
lovebird. He's not a conure, and he's not a parakeet. He looks very similar to Sprinkles the parrotlet,
but he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not
belong to the family Psittacidae like Sprinkles does, but he belongs to the family Psittaculidae,
like Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's
a small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures
are parrots, but not all parrots are conures. All conures are parakeets, but not all parakeets
are conures. And all parakeets are parrots, but not all
parrots are parakeets. Make sense? If you have any questions about all of that

**Transcript**:
Welcome to Animal Wonders! Today, we're going to meet some of our amazing
animal ambassadors. We're gonna learn about their group, we're
going to talk about why it's confusing sometimes to classify animals, and we're going to talk
a little bit about the terms we use. So, what do you think of when you hear the
word "conure"? If you thought "LOUD", you are so right. But, if you didn't even hear the word before,
you're me, ten years ago. This, is a conure! A green-cheeked conure to be exact, or you
can call her a green-cheek parakeet. I just call her Ginger. And this is where the complication of classifying
starts. The word "conure" is both an old term and
a new term. It's an old, out-of-date classification for
a genus of parrot-like New World birds and it was called conurus. "New World" just means the Americas. Now, the previous genus conurus included some
present-day genera that has now been broken apart into more specific groups. Today, the term is used mostly in aviculture,
which is the keeping and breeding of birds in captivity. And I use the term because that's how it was
first introduced to my many Central and South American psittacine friends. But it also helps me explain the difference
in the groups. So, I've heard of parrots and parakeets before,
but what the heck was a conure? This [bird squawks loudly] is a conure! This is a Jenday conure or a Jendaya parakeet--
both terms are correct. I call her Ecuador. Now Jenday conures are closely related to
Sun conures and they're very popular in the pet trade. But they are very very vocal. Oh! I soon discovered these birds were one of
the most neglected and re-homed groups in the animal rescue world. The more I learned about the individual personalities
of the birds that I got to rescue, my fascination with these overly exploited and underappreciated
group of birds grew. And the more I tried to define what a conure
was, the more complicated it seemed to get. So most people that see a bird with a curved
beak - you can do it-- oh! --and bright feathers say, "That's a parrot," and they're correct. So here's how it goes: all parrot-like birds
belong to the order Psittaciformes. But then there are families that break them
down into smaller groups. The three main families are Psittacidae, Psittaculidae
and Cacatuidae. The family Psittacidae includes birds like
macaws and parrots and conures and parakeets. The family Psittaculidae includes birds like
love birds and loris and other Old World parrots. And then the family Cacatuidae includes cockatoos
and cockatiels and others. So what makes a conure different form a parrot? Well they're not really different. They're just more specific. So, this is a parrot-- [bird squeals]. This is Zoe. She's a red-lored Amazon parrot, and you can
look at her-- [bird squawks] --and you can see that she has a very heavy body; and her
tail-- [bird says "pretty pretty pretty pretty"] --her tail is very squared at the bottom. Would you like another treat? No? Ok. But, then you look at-- [bird squawks] --at
Loulou, the half-moon conure, you can see he has a more slender body, and his tail is
tapered or cone-shaped. And you can see a big difference in [bird
squawks] not just their size, but the shape of their body. So if you look at Loulou and Ecuador, and
ignore the coloration on their feathers, just look at the characteristics on their body. Both of them have a hooked bill, curved in
a very similar way. They have long, tapered tails which are about
the same length as their body. They have short feet, and their toe arrangement
is zygodactyl, which is two toes in the front and two toes in the back. And if you look up at their eyes, they both
have a bare patch surrounding their eye. So the group of conures are made up of quite
a few different genera. The main two are Pyrrhura and Aratinga. These two are both in the Aratinga genus,
and Aratinga means "mini macaw." Speaking of, this, is a macaw! This is Joy, and she's a blue and gold macaw--
You so excited? --now you can see she's much larger than Lulu
and Equador, but she has similar characteristics in her body. You can see that she has almost a slender
body, and this long, tapered tail that's pretty much the same length as her body. So we met three conures, a parrot, and now
a macaw. But what's the difference between a parakeet
and a conure? Well, this is a parakeet. His name is Zapper. He's an Alexandrian parakeet, or, an Alexandrian
parrot. He can't be considered a conure even though
he has a long, tapered tail and the slender body of a conure. He is found in India, Thailand, and Afghanistan,
and surrounding areas. So, he's considered an Old World parrot instead
of a New World parrot. He's also part of the family Psittaculidae,
instead of Psittacidae. So let's meet another conure. This is Maui, and she's a color-morph with
a green-cheek conure. She's referred to as a pineapple green-cheek
conure. Note her long, slender tail and cone shape
like that-- so she belongs to the parakeet group --but she also lives in the New World
so she can be defined as a conure. So let's really classify her. Her order is Psittaciformes, her family is
Psittacidae, and then her genus is Pyrrhura, as opposed to Aratinga, which was Lulu and
Ecuador, the other one. Now let's make things even more fun! This is a parrotlet. A Pacific parrotlet named Sprinkles, and he
is a parrot, but not a parakeet. Notice his heavy body set and his tail, when
spread out, is going to look like a square, very similar to our Amazon parrot Zoe. And lastly, we have Boxer, the peach-faced
lovebird. He's not a conure, and he's not a parakeet. He looks very similar to Sprinkles the parrotlet,
but he is an Old World parrot. Very small little parrot, but he does not

like Zapper our Alexandrian parakeet. But, unlike Zapper, he's not a parakeet, he's
a small parrot with a heavy body and a square tail. Alright guys, so to wrap this up, all conures

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs." Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. "You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey." (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals
would look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process
works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default and ask, is there
a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser. So people hear about this study
and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative
to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light
for more than half a century. In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message
from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart
from the rest of us is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids
but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,
the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,
if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way
to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs." Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. "You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey." (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals
would look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process
works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default and ask, is there
a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser. So people hear about this study
and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative
to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light
for more than half a century. In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message
from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart
from the rest of us is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids
but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,
the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,
if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way
to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)

unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way
to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, "I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online." And I said, "OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?" "No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out." "All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate." "Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs." Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. "You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is." So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call "originals." Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, "I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating." And I was like, "That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, "I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey." (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, "This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination." So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, "You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking." And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: "I have a dream." That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, "You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online." They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals
would look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process
works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, "I'm crap," you say, "The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet." So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default and ask, is there
a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser. So people hear about this study
and they're like, "Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative
to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light
for more than half a century. In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message
from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart
from the rest of us is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids
but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,
the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,
if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself

to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
It was one of the strangest trials 
in Dutch history. The defendant in this 1947 case 
was an art forger who had counterfeited millions of dollars 
worth of paintings. But he wasn’t arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving 
that he had committed the fraud. Like many art forgers, 
Han van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had failed 
to bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to make fools 
of his detractors. He learned all he could 
about the Old Masters— their biographies, their techniques, 
and their materials. The artist he chose for his deception 
was 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer 
was famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in secret for six years, 
the forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice. He mixed his own paints 
after researching the raw materials and pigments available in Vermeer’s time. He bought 17th century canvases, 
created his own brushes, and aged the works 
by applying synthetic resin and baking them to dry 
and crack the paint. A forensic test could have detected 
the synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests 
were neither advanced nor widespread, and even today verification 
of a painting’s authenticity relies on the assessment 
of art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective 
judgment— as well as their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren 
truly outwitted the art world. From his research, he knew historians 
believed Vermeer had an early period of religious painting influenced 
by the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, 
Abraham Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, 
though none of these works had surfaced. So van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it "The Supper at Emmaus." Bredius declared van Meegeren’s fake 
the masterpiece of Vermeer’s oeuvre. Van Meegeren’s forgery was not totally 
up to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these inconsistencies 
could be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced before 
the artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval 
from the art world, the fake was sold in 1937 
for the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The success prompted van Meegeren 
to forge and sell more works through various art dealers. As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe 
in their authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland 
during the Second World War, Hermann Göring, 
one of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer 
to his collection of artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him 
an alleged early Vermeer painting titled "Christ with the Adulteress." As the tide of the war turned, 
so did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was 
arrested for delivering a priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— 
an act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting 
wasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step 
how he had forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— 
the very expert who had enabled his scam. Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius 
defended the painting’s authenticity. With few options left, van Meegeren 
set to work on a "new" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to the court, 
they finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating 
with the Nazis— and sentenced to a year imprisonment 
for fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren 
did, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public 
that he had tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that 
of a folk hero who had swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable 
in their own right— so much so that they were later forged 
in turn by his own son. The same canvases went from 
revered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for the skill 
and notoriety of the forger.

an act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting 
wasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step 
how he had forged it. But he faced an unexpected obstacle— 
the very expert who had enabled his scam. Moved to protect his reputation, Bredius 
defended the painting’s authenticity. With few options left, van Meegeren 
set to work on a "new" Vermeer. When he presented the fake to the court, 
they finally believed him. He was acquitted for collaborating 
with the Nazis— and sentenced to a year imprisonment 
for fraud. Though there’s evidence that van Meegeren 
did, in fact, collaborate with the Nazis, he managed to convince the public 
that he had tricked Göring on purpose, transforming his image into that 
of a folk hero who had swindled the Nazis. Thanks to this newfound notoriety, his works became valuable 
in their own right— so much so that they were later forged 
in turn by his own son. The same canvases went from 
revered classics to despised forgeries to works of art respected for the skill 
and notoriety of the forger.

**Transcript**:
It was one of the strangest trials 
in Dutch history. The defendant in this 1947 case 
was an art forger who had counterfeited millions of dollars 
worth of paintings. But he wasn’t arguing his innocence— in fact, his life depended on proving 
that he had committed the fraud. Like many art forgers, 
Han van Meegeren was an artist whose original works had failed 
to bring him renown. Embittered towards the art world, van Meegeren set out to make fools 
of his detractors. He learned all he could 
about the Old Masters— their biographies, their techniques, 
and their materials. The artist he chose for his deception 
was 17th century Baroque painter Johannes Vermeer— an ambitious decision given Vermeer 
was famed for his carefully executed and technically brilliant domestic scenes. Working in secret for six years, 
the forger perfected his art, copying numerous works as practice. He mixed his own paints 
after researching the raw materials and pigments available in Vermeer’s time. He bought 17th century canvases, 
created his own brushes, and aged the works 
by applying synthetic resin and baking them to dry 
and crack the paint. A forensic test could have detected 
the synthetic resin. But at the time, such tests 
were neither advanced nor widespread, and even today verification 
of a painting’s authenticity relies on the assessment 
of art specialists. So it’s a matter of their subjective 
judgment— as well as their reputation. And this is where van Meegeren 
truly outwitted the art world. From his research, he knew historians 
believed Vermeer had an early period of religious painting influenced 
by the Italian painter Caravaggio. The leading authority on Vermeer, 
Abraham Bredius, was a huge proponent of this theory, 
though none of these works had surfaced. So van Meegeren decided to make one. He called it "The Supper at Emmaus." Bredius declared van Meegeren’s fake 
the masterpiece of Vermeer’s oeuvre. Van Meegeren’s forgery was not totally 
up to Vermeer’s technical standards, but these inconsistencies 
could be made to fit the narrative: this was an early work, produced before 
the artist had come into his own. With the stamp of approval 
from the art world, the fake was sold in 1937 
for the equivalent of over $4 million in today’s money. The success prompted van Meegeren 
to forge and sell more works through various art dealers. As unbelievable as it may sound, the art world continued to believe 
in their authenticity. When the Nazis occupied Holland 
during the Second World War, Hermann Göring, 
one of Hitler’s top generals, sought to add a Vermeer 
to his collection of artwork looted from all over Europe. Van Meegeren obliged, selling him 
an alleged early Vermeer painting titled "Christ with the Adulteress." As the tide of the war turned, 
so did van Meegeren’s luck. Following the Allied victory, he was 
arrested for delivering a priceless piece of Dutch heritage to the Nazis— 
an act of treasonous collaboration punishable by death. To prove the painting 
wasn’t a national treasure, he explained step-by-step

[ INTRO ] Squeaks and I are celebrating today. Because guess what? It’s almost National Coloring Day! [Squeaks cheers] National Coloring Day is just what it sounds
like: a day to color and have fun. And that’s exactly what we’re going to
do … with a special project. We’re going to make some invisible ink! That means the ink will disappear, and then
you can color over it to reveal a secret message. All you’ll need is baking soda, water, purple
grape juice, two cups, a cotton swab like a Q-tip, and either a paint brush or a cotton ball. Oh, and a piece of white paper to write on,
and a grown-up, of course! The first thing we’ll do is mix a quarter
of a cup of baking soda and a quarter of a cup of water. The measurements don’t need to be exact
— we’re just trying to make sure we have about
the same amount of each. This baking soda-water mixture will be our
ink! [Squeaks is surprised by how simple it is] Yep, that’s all there is to it! Let’s write something on this paper here. Hmmm … let me think of a secret message
for you, Squeaks … OK! Now all we have to do is wait for it to dry,
and the message will be hidden! It looks like the ink is dry, so the secret
message is ready to be revealed! The question is, are you ready, Squeaks? Let’s do it, then! This is what the grape juice is for. We’ll dip the brush into the grape juice,
and paint over the message. Check it out! Science is awesome That was the message! There are lots of ways to make invisible ink
at home, but this is one of the easiest — and, I think, the coolest! Because we’re doing the same thing lots
of scientists do in their labs every day! No, they’re not writing secret messages. But they do mix things together to learn more
about them, like we just did! The baking soda we used to make the invisible
ink is really a type of chemical called a base. And when we added the grape juice to the base
on the paper, they reacted to each other! That means they changed. When it touched the baking soda, a chemical
in the grape juice changed to become darker. That’s why the parts of the paper where
the message was got darker, and we were able to read it! Now, baking soda is a safe chemical, so we
can cook with it and use it for experiments at home, but scientists use it in their labs
sometimes, too. Actually, scientists use all kinds of bases
in their labs, and sometimes they need to be able to test
if a chemical is a base. To do that, they combine the chemical with
something called an indicator. That’s another chemical that scientists
know will change color if it mixes with a base. And guess what? One of the ingredients in grape juice works
as an indicator! It’s called an anthocyanin, and it becomes
a darker purple color when it touches a base. [Squeaks points out that grape juice is already
purple] That’s true, the grape juice is already
purple! But when it touches a base like baking soda,
it becomes a much darker purple. So that’s the scientific secret to our invisible
ink. And now we can write all the secret messages
to each other we want … as long as we have some grape juice on hand! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun
with Squeaks and me, hit the subscribe button, and don’t forget to check us out on the
YouTube Kids app. We’ll see you next time, here at the Fort! [ OUTRO ]

ink! [Squeaks is surprised by how simple it is] Yep, that’s all there is to it! Let’s write something on this paper here. Hmmm … let me think of a secret message
for you, Squeaks … OK! Now all we have to do is wait for it to dry,
and the message will be hidden! It looks like the ink is dry, so the secret
message is ready to be revealed! The question is, are you ready, Squeaks? Let’s do it, then! This is what the grape juice is for. We’ll dip the brush into the grape juice,
and paint over the message. Check it out! Science is awesome That was the message! There are lots of ways to make invisible ink
at home, but this is one of the easiest — and, I think, the coolest! Because we’re doing the same thing lots
of scientists do in their labs every day! No, they’re not writing secret messages. But they do mix things together to learn more
about them, like we just did! The baking soda we used to make the invisible
ink is really a type of chemical called a base. And when we added the grape juice to the base
on the paper, they reacted to each other! That means they changed. When it touched the baking soda, a chemical
in the grape juice changed to become darker. That’s why the parts of the paper where
the message was got darker, and we were able to read it! Now, baking soda is a safe chemical, so we
can cook with it and use it for experiments at home, but scientists use it in their labs
sometimes, too. Actually, scientists use all kinds of bases
in their labs, and sometimes they need to be able to test
if a chemical is a base. To do that, they combine the chemical with
something called an indicator. That’s another chemical that scientists
know will change color if it mixes with a base. And guess what? One of the ingredients in grape juice works
as an indicator! It’s called an anthocyanin, and it becomes
a darker purple color when it touches a base. [Squeaks points out that grape juice is already
purple] That’s true, the grape juice is already
purple! But when it touches a base like baking soda,
it becomes a much darker purple. So that’s the scientific secret to our invisible
ink. And now we can write all the secret messages
to each other we want … as long as we have some grape juice on hand! Thanks for joining us! If you want to keep learning and having fun

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, 
once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges 
from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. As the ruler of the city, 
you’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when 7 Leviathan Lords 
rose out of the roiling waters and surrounded your city. Each commands 10 giant kraken, and each kraken 
is accompanied by 12 mermites. Your city’s puny army 
is hopelessly outmatched. You think back to the legends. In the stories, the ruler of the city 
saved his people by feeding the creatures 
a ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally 
between the leviathans lords. Each leviathan would then divide its share
into 11 equal piles, keeping one, and giving the other 10 
to their kraken commanders. Each kraken would then divide its share 
into 13 equal piles, keeping one, and distributing the other 
twelve to their mermite minions. If any one of these divisions left 
an unequal pile or leftover pearl, the monsters would pull everyone 
to the bottom of the sea. Such was the fate 
of your fabled sister city. You rush to the ancient treasure room 
and find five chests, each containing a precisely counted number
of pearls prepared by your ancestors 
for exactly this purpose. Each of the chests bears a number 
telling how many pearls it contains. Unfortunately, the symbols they used 
to write digits 1,000 years ago have changed with time, and you don’t know how 
to read the ancient numbers. With hundreds of thousands of pearls 
in each chest, there’s no time to recount. One of these chests will save your city and the rest will lead 
to its certain doom. Which do you choose? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough information to decode
the ancient Atlantartican numeral system. But all hope is not lost, because there’s another piece 
of information those symbols contain: patterns. If we can find a matching pattern 
in arabic numerals, we can still pick the right chest. Let’s take stock of what we know. A quantity of pearls that can appease 
the sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Rather than trying out numbers 
at random, let’s examine ones that have this property and see if there are any 
patterns that unite them. Being divisible by 7, 11, and 13 means that our number must 
be a multiple of 7, 11, and 13. Those three numbers are all prime, 
so multiplying them together will give us their least 
common multiple: 1001. That’s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable 
offering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 1001. Let’s try multiplying it by a three digit 
number, just to get a feel for what we might get. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar 
with other examples. It’s a peculiar pattern. Why would multiplying a three-digit 
number by 1001 end up giving you two copies 
of that number, written one after the other? Breaking down the multiplication 
problem can give us the answer. 1001 times any number x is equal 
to 1000x + x. For example, 725 times 1000 is 725,000, 
and 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of 
those two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have 
that many thousands, plus one more. Even though you don’t know how 
to read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits 
represents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete
examples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look
abstract and mysterious. The monsters accept your ransom 
and swim back down to the depths for another thousand years. With the proper planning, that should give you plenty of time 
to prepare for their inevitable return.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, 
once every thousand years a host of sea monsters emerges 
from the depths to demand tribute from the floating city of Atlantartica. As the ruler of the city, 
you’d always dismissed the stories… until today, when 7 Leviathan Lords 
rose out of the roiling waters and surrounded your city. Each commands 10 giant kraken, and each kraken 
is accompanied by 12 mermites. Your city’s puny army 
is hopelessly outmatched. You think back to the legends. In the stories, the ruler of the city 
saved his people by feeding the creatures 
a ransom of pearls. The pearls would be split equally 
between the leviathans lords. Each leviathan would then divide its share
into 11 equal piles, keeping one, and giving the other 10 
to their kraken commanders. Each kraken would then divide its share 
into 13 equal piles, keeping one, and distributing the other 
twelve to their mermite minions. If any one of these divisions left 
an unequal pile or leftover pearl, the monsters would pull everyone 
to the bottom of the sea. Such was the fate 
of your fabled sister city. You rush to the ancient treasure room 
and find five chests, each containing a precisely counted number
of pearls prepared by your ancestors 
for exactly this purpose. Each of the chests bears a number 
telling how many pearls it contains. Unfortunately, the symbols they used 
to write digits 1,000 years ago have changed with time, and you don’t know how 
to read the ancient numbers. With hundreds of thousands of pearls 
in each chest, there’s no time to recount. One of these chests will save your city and the rest will lead 
to its certain doom. Which do you choose? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough information to decode
the ancient Atlantartican numeral system. But all hope is not lost, because there’s another piece 
of information those symbols contain: patterns. If we can find a matching pattern 
in arabic numerals, we can still pick the right chest. Let’s take stock of what we know. A quantity of pearls that can appease 
the sea monsters must be divisible by 7, 11, and 13. Rather than trying out numbers 
at random, let’s examine ones that have this property and see if there are any 
patterns that unite them. Being divisible by 7, 11, and 13 means that our number must 
be a multiple of 7, 11, and 13. Those three numbers are all prime, 
so multiplying them together will give us their least 
common multiple: 1001. That’s a useful starting place because we now know that any viable 
offering to the sea monsters must be a multiple of 1001. Let’s try multiplying it by a three digit 
number, just to get a feel for what we might get. If we try 861 times 1001, we get 861,861, and we see something similar 
with other examples. It’s a peculiar pattern. Why would multiplying a three-digit 
number by 1001 end up giving you two copies 
of that number, written one after the other? Breaking down the multiplication 
problem can give us the answer. 1001 times any number x is equal 
to 1000x + x. For example, 725 times 1000 is 725,000, 
and 725 x 1 is 725. So 725 x 1001 will be the sum of 
those two numbers: 725,725. And there’s nothing special about 725. Pick any three-digit number, and your final product will have 
that many thousands, plus one more. Even though you don’t know how 
to read the numbers on the chests, you can read which pattern of digits 
represents a number divisible by 1001. As with many problems, trying concrete
examples can give you an intuition for behavior that may at first look
abstract and mysterious. The monsters accept your ransom 
and swim back down to the depths for another thousand years. With the proper planning, that should give you plenty of time 
to prepare for their inevitable return.

**Transcript**:
Working in Vienna at the turn 
of the 20th century, he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline 
of psychoanalysis. He proposed that people are motivated 
by unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious 
through talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all 
other psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud 
right about human nature? And were his methods scientific? Order, order. 
Today on the stand we have… Dad? Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers
in the history of psychology. An egomaniac who propagated 
pseudoscientific theories. Well, which is it? He tackled issues medicine 
refused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called 
hysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken
seriously at all. From the women with depression 
he treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients 
forced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological 
disorders were real. He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced
that our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges 
and repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious 
or irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma 
survivors— and caused real harm. How’s that? He misrepresented some of his most 
famous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients 
when in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced 
by his theories coaxed their patients into "recovering" supposedly repressed memories 
of childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later
misapplications of his work— that would be projecting. Plenty of his ideas were harmful 
without any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality 
as a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life
by their lack of penises. Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space 
for future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques
that millions of people rely on came out of the work he started 
with psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows 
there’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. Psychologists today only believe 
in a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware 
of everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, 
ascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas
that were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought 
individual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance
of events in ancient history. And I mean ancient— 
like the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually 
believed these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase 
of cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally 
an echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these,
how can we take him seriously? Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical 
by today’s standards, but we can’t discount 
their influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator 
linking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk 
about our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? 
Defense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. But Freud didn’t present himself as a 
social theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. Are you saying he… repressed
inconvenient facts? Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable. Wait, so you’re saying he was right? No, his ideas were framed so that 
there’s no way to empirically verify them. Freud didn’t even necessarily believe 
in the psychoanalysis he was peddling. He was pessimistic 
about the impact of therapy. What! I think I need to lie down! Many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas 
don’t hold up to modern science, and his clinical practices don’t meet 
today’s ethical standards. At the same time, he sparked 
a revolution in psychology and society, and created a vocabulary 
for discussing emotion. Freud made his share of mistakes. But is a thinker responsible 
for how subsequent generations put their ideas to use? Do they deserve the blame, 
credit, or redemption when we put history on trial?

famous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients 
when in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced 
by his theories coaxed their patients into "recovering" supposedly repressed memories 
of childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later
misapplications of his work— that would be projecting. Plenty of his ideas were harmful 
without any misapplication. He viewed homosexuality 
as a developmental glitch. He coined the term penis envy— meaning women are haunted for life
by their lack of penises. Freud was a product of his era. Yes, some of the specifics were flawed, but he created a new space 
for future scientists to explore, investigate, and build upon. Modern therapy techniques
that millions of people rely on came out of the work he started 
with psychoanalysis. And today everyone knows 
there’s an unconscious— that idea was popularized Freud. Psychologists today only believe 
in a “cognitive unconscious,” the fact that you aren’t aware 
of everything going on at a given moment. Freud took this idea way too far, 
ascribing deep meaning to everything. He built his theories on scientific ideas
that were outdated even in his own time, not just by today’s standards— for example, he thought 
individual psychology is derived from the biological inheritance
of events in ancient history. And I mean ancient— 
like the Ice Age or the killing of Moses. Freud and his closest allies actually 
believed these prehistorical traumas had ongoing impacts on human psychology. He thought that the phase 
of cold indifference to sexuality during pubescence was literally 
an echo of the Ice Age. With fantastical beliefs like these,
how can we take him seriously? Any renowned thinker from centuries past has ideas that seem fantastical 
by today’s standards, but we can’t discount 
their influence on this basis. Freud was an innovator 
linking ideas across many fields. His concepts have become everyday terms that shape how we understand and talk 
about our own experiences. The Oedipus complex? Ego and id? 
Defense mechanisms? Death wishes? All Freud. But Freud didn’t present himself as a 
social theorist— he insisted that his work was scientific. Are you saying he… repressed
inconvenient facts? Freud’s theories were unfalsifiable. Wait, so you’re saying he was right? No, his ideas were framed so that 
there’s no way to empirically verify them. Freud didn’t even necessarily believe 
in the psychoanalysis he was peddling. He was pessimistic 
about the impact of therapy. What! I think I need to lie down! Many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas 
don’t hold up to modern science, and his clinical practices don’t meet 
today’s ethical standards. At the same time, he sparked 
a revolution in psychology and society, and created a vocabulary 
for discussing emotion. Freud made his share of mistakes. But is a thinker responsible 
for how subsequent generations put their ideas to use? Do they deserve the blame, 
credit, or redemption when we put history on trial?

**Transcript**:
Working in Vienna at the turn 
of the 20th century, he began his career as a neurologist before pioneering the discipline 
of psychoanalysis. He proposed that people are motivated 
by unconscious desires and repressed memories, and their problems can be addressed by making those motivations conscious 
through talk therapy. His influence towers above that of all 
other psychologists in the public eye. But was Sigmund Freud 
right about human nature? And were his methods scientific? Order, order. 
Today on the stand we have… Dad? Ahem, no, your honor. This is Doctor Sigmund Freud, one of the most innovative thinkers
in the history of psychology. An egomaniac who propagated 
pseudoscientific theories. Well, which is it? He tackled issues medicine 
refused to address. Freud’s private practice treated women who suffered from what was called 
hysteria at the time, and their complaints hadn’t been taken
seriously at all. From the women with depression 
he treated initially to World War I veterans with PTSD, Freud’s talking cure worked, and the visibility he gave his patients 
forced the medical establishment to acknowledge their psychological 
disorders were real. He certainly didn’t help all his patients. Freud was convinced
that our behavior is shaped by unconscious urges 
and repressed memories. He invented baseless unconscious 
or irrational drivers behind the behavior of trauma 
survivors— and caused real harm. How’s that? He misrepresented some of his most 
famous case studies, claiming his treatment had cured patients 
when in fact they had gotten worse. Later therapists influenced 
by his theories coaxed their patients into "recovering" supposedly repressed memories 
of childhood abuse that never happened. Lives and families were torn apart. You can’t blame Freud for later

**Transcript**:
Flanked by two powerful European nations,
the English Channel has long been one of the world’s 
most important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores 
and stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's 
proposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands 
linked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended 
from floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice 
the length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured 
European imagination. The invention 
of the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer 
of chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel 
more feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles 
were ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation 
as a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion 
shut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered 
these worries obsolete, but new economic concerns 
arose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after 
the initial excavation, the two countries 
reached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed 
with private funding. In 1985, a group 
of French and British companies invested the modern equivalent 
of 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive 
infrastructure project to date. The design called 
for three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, 
one for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, 
emergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers 
of tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating 
from both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast 
revealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks 
let water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop 
waterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, 
and forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water 
flooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, 
the British had to use grout to seal the cracks 
created in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk 
about to be drilled. With these obstacles behind them, 
both teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons 
drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings 
to stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons 
following each machine. Even at top speed, 
work had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path 
between unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes 
made by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had 
to constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet 
within 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed 
satellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists 
who used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. During construction, 
the project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years 
of tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg 
emerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross 
the channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers 
and pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, 
cables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony 
marked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began 
16 months later, with trains for passengers 
and rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services 
over 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel 
in just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has 
the privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried 
to enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed 
the tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history 
can serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best 
when breaking down barriers.

**Transcript**:
Flanked by two powerful European nations,
the English Channel has long been one of the world’s 
most important maritime passages. Yet for most of its history, the channel’s rocky shores 
and stormy weather made crossing a dangerous prospect. Engineers of the early 1800's 
proposed numerous plans for spanning the 33 kilometer gap. Their designs included artificial islands 
linked by bridges, submerged tubes suspended 
from floating platforms, and an underwater passage more than twice 
the length of any existing tunnel. By the end of the century, this last proposal had captured 
European imagination. The invention 
of the tunnel boring machine and the discovery of a stable layer 
of chalk marl below the seabed made this fantastic tunnel 
more feasible. But the project’s most urgent obstacles 
were ones no engineer could solve. At the time, Britons viewed their geographic isolation 
as a strategic advantage, and fears about French invasion 
shut down plans for the tunnel. The rise of aerial warfare rendered 
these worries obsolete, but new economic concerns 
arose to replace them. Finally, 100 years after 
the initial excavation, the two countries 
reached an agreement— the tunnel would proceed 
with private funding. In 1985, a group 
of French and British companies invested the modern equivalent 
of 14 billion pounds, making the tunnel the most expensive 
infrastructure project to date. The design called 
for three separate tunnels— one for trains to France, 
one for trains to England, and one service tunnel between them. Alongside crossover chambers, 
emergency passages, and air ducts, this amounted to over 200 kilometers 
of tunnels. In 1988, workers began excavating 
from both sides, planning to meet in the middle. Early surveys of the French coast 
revealed the site was full of fault lines. These small cracks 
let water seep into the rock, so engineers had to develop 
waterproof boring machines. The British anticipated drier conditions, 
and forged ahead with regular borers. But only months into the work, water 
flooded in through undetected fissures. To drill in this wet chalk, 
the British had to use grout to seal the cracks 
created in the borer’s wake, and even work ahead of the main borer to reinforce the chalk 
about to be drilled. With these obstacles behind them, 
both teams began drilling at full speed. Boring machines weighing up to 1,300 tons 
drilled at nearly 3.5 meters per hour. As they dug, they installed lining rings 
to stabilize the tunnel behind them, making way for support wagons 
following each machine. Even at top speed, 
work had to proceed carefully. The chalk layer followed a winding path 
between unstable rock and clay, punctured by over 100 boring holes 
made by previous surveyors. Furthermore, both teams had 
to constantly check their coordinates to ensure they were on track to meet 
within 2 centimeters of each other. To maintain this delicate trajectory, the borers employed 
satellite positioning systems, as well as paleontologists 
who used excavated fossils to confirm they were at the right depth. During construction, 
the project employed over 13,000 people and cost the lives of ten workers. But after two and a half years 
of tunneling, the two sides finally made contact. British worker Graham Fagg 
emerged on the French side, becoming the first human to cross 
the channel by land since the Ice Age. There was still work to be done— from installing crossover chambers 
and pumping stations, to laying over a hundred miles of tracks, 
cables, and sensors. But on May 6, 1994, an opening ceremony 
marked the tunnel’s completion. Full public service began 
16 months later, with trains for passengers 
and rail shuttles for cars and trucks. Today, the Channel Tunnel services 
over 20 million passengers a year, transporting riders across the channel 
in just 35 minutes. Unfortunately, not everyone has 
the privilege of making this trip legally. Thousands of refugees have tried 
to enter Britain through the tunnel in sometimes fatal attempts. These tragedies have transformed 
the tunnel’s southern entrance into an ongoing site of conflict. Hopefully, the structure’s history 
can serve as a reminder that humanity is at their best 
when breaking down barriers.

**Transcript**:
What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you. That's just how the media
has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage
about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans
say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk
to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you
who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says,
because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person
like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing
the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time
a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect
and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every
reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels. And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer. (Laughter) I later had a child,
after getting married, and I was living essentially
the Egyptian-American dream. And then that terrible morning
of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember
exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen
finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen
and see the words "Breaking News." There was smoke,
airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear, "... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca." Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions
had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day, we had to drive
across Middle America to move to a new city
to start grad school. And I remember sitting
in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town in what felt like
a completely different world. And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading warnings from national
Muslim organizations saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate." I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims
congregate for worship. And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target." And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home. And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people
who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually
saying things like, "There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques. They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether, and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense,
because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans,
aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes. Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find
about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off
from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group
can brainwash them into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people
going to the mosque. Now, some will still argue
Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS
bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can
to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in
to their narrative if we cast them as representatives
of a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them,
they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam
told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking
of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact
with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem
was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had
talked to had shut her down and said that her rage,
her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel
and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her
back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage --
instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque
prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia
affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought? Well, one study -- actually,
several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid,
at least three things happen. We become more accepting
of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects
were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting
of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights
of American Muslims. Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation
of a free society, which is rational
and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries
in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear
is harming us all. (Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having
to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor
were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school,
talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me
that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there
and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, "When did my baby brother
become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements
on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal. So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing
our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us. (Applause) I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose
courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose? What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that? Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those
who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people? Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims
around the world -- and I've done this, I've done
the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem
like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it. HW: Thank you so much.
Dalia Mogahed. (Applause)

of a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them,
they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam
told me a story that really took me aback. He said that a girl came to him because she was thinking
of going to join ISIS. And I was really surprised and asked him, had she been in contact
with a radical religious leader? And he said the problem
was quite the opposite, that every cleric that she had
talked to had shut her down and said that her rage,
her sense of injustice in the world, was just going to get her in trouble. And so with nowhere to channel
and make sense of this anger, she was a prime target to be exploited by extremists promising her a solution. What this imam did was to connect her
back to God and to her community. He didn't shame her for her rage --
instead, he gave her constructive ways to make real change in the world. What she learned at that mosque
prevented her from going to join ISIS. I've told you a little bit about how Islamophobia
affects me and my family. But how does it impact ordinary Americans? How does it impact everyone else? How does consuming fear 24 hours a day
affect the health of our democracy, the health of our free thought? Well, one study -- actually,
several studies in neuroscience -- show that when we're afraid,
at least three things happen. We become more accepting
of authoritarianism, conformity and prejudice. One study showed that when subjects
were exposed to news stories that were negative about Muslims, they became more accepting
of military attacks on Muslim countries and policies that curtail the rights
of American Muslims. Now, this isn't just academic. When you look at when
anti-Muslim sentiment spiked between 2001 and 2013, it happened three times, but it wasn't around terrorist attacks. It was in the run up to the Iraq War
and during two election cycles. So Islamophobia isn't just
the natural response to Muslim terrorism as I would have expected. It can actually be a tool
of public manipulation, eroding the very foundation
of a free society, which is rational
and well-informed citizens. Muslims are like canaries
in the coal mine. We might be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear
is harming us all. (Applause) And assigning collective guilt isn't just about having
to explain yourself all the time. Deah and his wife Yusor
were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school. Deah was an athlete. He was in dental school,
talented, promising ... And his sister would tell me
that he was the sweetest, most generous human being she knew. She was visiting him there
and he showed her his resume, and she was amazed. She said, "When did my baby brother
become such an accomplished young man?" Just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit
to her brother and his new wife, their neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered them, as well as Yusor's sister, Razan,
who was visiting for the afternoon, in their apartment, execution style, after posting anti-Muslim statements
on his Facebook page. He shot Deah eight times. So bigotry isn't just immoral,
it can even be lethal. So, back to my story. What happened after 9/11? Did we go to the mosque
or did we play it safe and stay home? Well, we talked it over, and it might seem like
a small decision, but to us, it was about what kind of America
we wanted to leave for our kids: one that would control us by fear or one where we were practicing
our religion freely. So we decided to go to the mosque. And we put my son in his car seat, buckled him in, and we drove silently,
intensely, to the mosque. I took him out, I took off my shoes,
I walked into the prayer hall and what I saw made me stop. The place was completely full. And then the imam made an announcement, thanking and welcoming our guests, because half the congregation were Christians, Jews,
Buddhists, atheists, people of faith and no faith, who had come not to attack us,
but to stand in solidarity with us. (Applause) I just break down at this time. These people were there because they chose
courage and compassion over panic and prejudice. What will you choose? What will you choose
at this time of fear and bigotry? Will you play it safe? Or will you join those who say we are better than that? Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. Helen Walters: So Dalia,
you seem to have struck a chord. But I wonder, what would you say to those
who might argue that you're giving a TED Talk, you're clearly a deep thinker, you work at a fancy think tank, you're an exception, you're not the rule. What would you say to those people? Dalia Mogahed: I would say,
don't let this stage distract you, I'm completely ordinary. I'm not an exception. My story is not unusual. I am as ordinary as they come. When you look at Muslims
around the world -- and I've done this, I've done
the largest study ever done on Muslims around the world -- people want ordinary things. They want prosperity for their family, they want jobs and they want to live in peace. So I am not in any way an exception. When you meet people who seem
like an exception to the rule, oftentimes it's that the rule is broken, not that they're an exception to it. HW: Thank you so much.
Dalia Mogahed. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
What do you think when you look at me? A woman of faith? An expert? Maybe even a sister. Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist. Or just an airport security line delay. That one's actually true. (Laughter) If some of your perceptions were negative,
I don't really blame you. That's just how the media
has been portraying people who look like me. One study found that 80 percent of news coverage
about Islam and Muslims is negative. And studies show that Americans
say that most don't know a Muslim. I guess people don't talk
to their Uber drivers. (Laughter) Well, for those of you
who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you. Let me tell you who I am. I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, cream on the side. I'm an introvert. I'm a wannabe fitness fanatic. And I'm a practicing, spiritual Muslim. But not like Lady Gaga says,
because baby, I wasn't born this way. It was a choice. When I was 17, I decided to come out. No, not as a gay person
like some of my friends, but as a Muslim, and decided to start wearing
the hijab, my head covering. My feminist friends were aghast: "Why are you oppressing yourself?" The funny thing was, it was actually at that time
a feminist declaration of independence from the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old, to conform to a perfect
and unattainable standard of beauty. I didn't just passively accept
the faith of my parents. I wrestled with the Quran. I read and reflected
and questioned and doubted and, ultimately, believed. My relationship with God --
it was not love at first sight. It was a trust and a slow surrender that deepened with every
reading of the Quran. Its rhythmic beauty
sometimes moves me to tears. I see myself in it.
I feel that God knows me. Have you ever felt like someone sees you,
completely understands you and yet loves you anyway? That's how it feels. And so later, I got married, and like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer. (Laughter) I later had a child,
after getting married, and I was living essentially
the Egyptian-American dream. And then that terrible morning
of September, 2001. I think a lot of you probably remember
exactly where you were that morning. I was sitting in my kitchen
finishing breakfast, and I look up on the screen
and see the words "Breaking News." There was smoke,
airplanes flying into buildings, people jumping out of buildings. What was this? An accident? A malfunction? My shock quickly turned to outrage. Who would do this? And I switch the channel and I hear, "... Muslim terrorist ...," "... in the name of Islam ...," "... Middle-Eastern descent ...," "... jihad ...," "... we should bomb Mecca." Oh my God. Not only had my country been attacked, but in a flash, somebody else's actions
had turned me from a citizen to a suspect. That same day, we had to drive
across Middle America to move to a new city
to start grad school. And I remember sitting
in the passenger seat as we drove in silence, crouched as low as I could go in my seat, for the first time in my life,
afraid for anyone to know I was a Muslim. We moved into our apartment
that night in a new town in what felt like
a completely different world. And then I was hearing
and seeing and reading warnings from national
Muslim organizations saying things like,
"Be alert," "Be aware," "Stay in well-lit areas,"
"Don't congregate." I stayed inside all week. And then it was Friday that same week, the day that Muslims
congregate for worship. And again the warnings were,
"Don't go that first Friday, it could be a target." And I was watching the news,
wall-to-wall coverage. Emotions were so raw, understandably, and I was also hearing
about attacks on Muslims, or people who were perceived
to be Muslim, being pulled out and beaten in the street. Mosques were actually firebombed. And I thought, we should just stay home. And yet, something didn't feel right. Because those people
who attacked our country attacked our country. I get it that people were angry
at the terrorists. Guess what? So was I. And so to have to explain yourself
all the time isn't easy. I don't mind questions. I love questions. It's the accusations that are tough. Today we hear people actually
saying things like, "There's a problem in this country,
and it's called Muslims. When are we going to get rid of them?" So, some people want to ban Muslims
and close down mosques. They talk about my community
kind of like we're a tumor in the body of America. And the only question is,
are we malignant or benign? You know, a malignant tumor
you extract altogether, and a benign tumor
you just keep under surveillance. The choices don't make sense,
because it's the wrong question. Muslims, like all other Americans,
aren't a tumor in the body of America, we're a vital organ. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic athletes. Now, is closing down mosques
going to make America safer? It might free up some parking spots, but it will not end terrorism. Going to a mosque regularly
is actually linked to having more tolerant views
of people of other faiths and greater civic engagement. And as one police chief
in the Washington, DC area recently told me, people don't actually
get radicalized at mosques. They get radicalized in their basement
or bedroom, in front of a computer. And what you find
about the radicalization process is it starts online, but the first thing that happens is the person gets cut off
from their community, from even their family, so that the extremist group
can brainwash them into believing that they,
the terrorists, are the true Muslims, and everyone else who abhors
their behavior and ideology are sellouts or apostates. So if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to keep people
going to the mosque. Now, some will still argue
Islam is a violent religion. After all, a group like ISIS
bases its brutality on the Quran. Now, as a Muslim, as a mother,
as a human being, I think we need to do everything we can
to stop a group like ISIS. But we would be giving in
to their narrative if we cast them as representatives
of a faith of 1.6 billion people. (Applause) Thank you. ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do
with Christianity. (Applause) Both groups claim to base
their ideology on their holy book. But when you look at them,
they're not motivated by what they read in their holy book. It's their brutality that makes them
read these things into the scripture. Recently, a prominent imam

**Transcript**:
Schizophrenia was first identified 
more than a century ago, but we still don’t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood 
and stigmatized illnesses today. So, let’s walk through what we do know— 
from symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass 
a number of related disorders that have similar symptoms 
but varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia 
has slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— 
subtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment 
of unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed 
after the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens 
or early twenties for men and the late twenties 
or early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature 
delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur 
in people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It’s a common misperception 
that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption 
of thought processes, rather than the manifestation 
of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced 
in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, 
expression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, 
like difficulty concentrating, remembering information, 
and making decisions. So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause,
but a combination of genetic and environmental 
risk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest 
genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people 
have schizophrenia, children or siblings of people 
with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin 
of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives 
of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits 
associated with the disorder— but not to an extent 
that requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly 
play a role, but we don’t know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure 
to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance 
that someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, 
including marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don’t affect 
everyone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure 
to environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate 
additional risk might tip the balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat 
schizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures 
of the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics 
block dopamine receptors. They can be very effective 
in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine 
in particular brain pathways. But the same drugs 
can make negative symptoms worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms 
of schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine 
in other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia 
show a loss of neural tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy 
is a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations 
of antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting 
multiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system 
is responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling 
throughout the brain and body, they can have other 
side effects like weight gain. In spite of these complications, 
antipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined 
with other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though 
it provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging 
as an effective treatment, especially when other options 
have failed. Early intervention 
is also extremely important. After months or years 
of untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded 
in someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma 
attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia 
are often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely 
to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce 
the likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, 
their families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma 
and improves access to treatment.

of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced 
in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation, 
expression of emotion, or speech. There are cognitive symptoms as well, 
like difficulty concentrating, remembering information, 
and making decisions. So what causes the onset of psychosis? There likely isn’t one single cause,
but a combination of genetic and environmental 
risk factors that contribute. Schizophrenia has some of the strongest 
genetic links of any psychiatric illness. Though about 1% of people 
have schizophrenia, children or siblings of people 
with schizophrenia are ten times likelier to develop the disease, and an identical twin 
of someone with schizophrenia has a 40% chance of being affected. Often, immediate relatives 
of people with schizophrenia exhibit milder versions of traits 
associated with the disorder— but not to an extent 
that requires treatment. Multiple genes almost certainly 
play a role, but we don’t know how many, or which ones. Environmental factors like exposure 
to certain viruses in early infancy might increase the chance 
that someone will develop schizophrenia, and use of some drugs, 
including marijuana, may trigger the onset of psychosis in highly susceptible individuals. These factors don’t affect 
everyone the same way. For those with very low genetic risk, no amount of exposure 
to environmental risk factors will lead them to develop schizophrenia; for those with very high risk, moderate 
additional risk might tip the balance. The antipsychotic drugs used to treat 
schizophrenia have helped researchers work backwards to trace signatures 
of the disorder in the brain. Traditional antipsychotics 
block dopamine receptors. They can be very effective 
in reducing positive symptoms, which are linked to an excess of dopamine 
in particular brain pathways. But the same drugs 
can make negative symptoms worse, and we’ve found that negative symptoms 
of schizophrenia may be tied to too little dopamine 
in other brain areas. Some people with schizophrenia 
show a loss of neural tissue, and it’s unclear whether this atrophy 
is a result of the disease itself or drug-induced suppression of signaling. Fortunately, newer generations 
of antipsychotics aim to address some of these issues by targeting 
multiple neurotransmitters, like serotonin in addition to dopamine. It’s clear that no one transmitter system 
is responsible for all symptoms, and because these drugs affect signaling 
throughout the brain and body, they can have other 
side effects like weight gain. In spite of these complications, 
antipsychotics can be very effective, especially when combined 
with other interventions like cognitive-behavioral therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy, though 
it provides relatively short-lived relief, is also re-emerging 
as an effective treatment, especially when other options 
have failed. Early intervention 
is also extremely important. After months or years 
of untreated psychosis, certain psychoses can become embedded 
in someone’s personality. And yet, the dehumanizing stigma 
attached to this diagnosis can prevent people from seeking help. People with schizophrenia 
are often perceived as dangerous, but are actually much more likely 
to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators. And proper treatment may help reduce 
the likelihood of violence associated with schizophrenia. That’s why education— for patients, 
their families, and their communities— helps erode the stigma 
and improves access to treatment.

**Transcript**:
Schizophrenia was first identified 
more than a century ago, but we still don’t know its exact causes. It remains one of the most misunderstood 
and stigmatized illnesses today. So, let’s walk through what we do know— 
from symptoms to causes and treatments. Schizophrenia is considered a syndrome, which means it may encompass 
a number of related disorders that have similar symptoms 
but varying causes. Every person with schizophrenia 
has slightly different symptoms, and the first signs can be easy to miss— 
subtle personality changes, irritability, or a gradual encroachment 
of unusual thoughts. Patients are usually diagnosed 
after the onset of psychosis, which typically occurs in the late teens 
or early twenties for men and the late twenties 
or early thirties for women. A first psychotic episode can feature 
delusions, hallucinations, and disordered speech and behavior. These are called positive symptoms, meaning they occur 
in people with schizophrenia but not in the general population. It’s a common misperception 
that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, but these symptoms indicate a disruption 
of thought processes, rather than the manifestation 
of another personality. Schizophrenia also has negative symptoms, these are qualities that are reduced 
in people with schizophrenia, such as motivation,

**Transcript**:
I want you to touch your face. Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right? You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true. You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers. You're feeling some of the fungi that drifted down
from the air ducts today. They set off our allergies and smell of mildew. You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin. They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body odor. You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes and sprayed onto you
with your last shower. Sorry. (Laughter) You're probably even giving
a microscopic high five to the two species of mites
that live on our faces, on all of our faces. They've spent the night
squirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose. (Laughter) Many of them are now leaking
their gut contents onto your pores. (Laughter) Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach? That's how you feel now, but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future. For the last 100 years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us. If I told you there was
a bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised
solution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect. We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now. But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology on this planet. The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems. I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us, and that's often in our most intimate
and boring environments, be it under our couches, in our backyards, or in our belly buttons. I do this work because it turns out
that we know very little about the microscopic life
that's nearest us. As of a few years ago,
no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms
live in your home -- your home, the place you know
better than anywhere else. And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA techniques to uncover the microscopic
life nearest us. In doing so, we found
over 600 species of bugs that live in USA homes, everything from spiders and cockroaches to tiny mites that cling to feathers. And we found over 100,000 species
of bacteria and fungi that live in our dust bunnies, thousands more that live
on our clothes or in our showers. We've gone further still, and we looked at the microorganisms that live inside the bodies
of each of those bugs in our home. In each bug, for example, a wasp, we see a microscopic jungle
unfold in a petri plate, a world of hundreds of vibrant species. Behold the biological cosmos! So many of the species
you're looking at right now don't yet have names. Most of the life around us
remains unknown. I remember the first time I discovered
and got to name a new species. It was a fungus that lives
in the nest of a paper wasp. It's white and fluffy, and I named it "mucor nidicola," meaning in Latin that it lives
in the nest of another. This is a picture of it
growing on a dinosaur, because everyone
thinks dinosaurs are cool. At the time, I was in graduate school, and I was so excited
that I had found this new life form. I called up my dad, and I go, "Dad! I just discovered
a new microorganism species." And he laughed and he goes, "That's great. I hope you also
discovered a cure for it." (Laughter) "Cure it." Now, my dad is my biggest fan, so in that crushing moment where he wanted
to kill my new little life form, I realized that actually I had failed him, both as a daughter and a scientist. In my years toiling away in labs
and in people's backyards, investigating and cataloging
the microscopic life around us, I'd never made clear
my true mission to him. My goal is not to find technology to kill the new microscopic
life around us. My goal is to find new technology
from this life, that will help save us. The diversity of life in our homes is more
than a list of 100,000 new species. It is 100,000 new sources
of solutions to human problems. I know it's hard to believe
that anything that's so small or only has one cell can do anything powerful, but they can. These creatures
are microscopic alchemists, with the ability to transform
their environment with an arsenal of chemical tools. This means that they can live
anywhere on this planet, and they can eat whatever
food is around them. This means they can eat everything
from toxic waste to plastic, and they can produce waste products
like oil and battery power and even tiny nuggets of real gold. They can transform the inedible
into nutritive. They can make sugar into alcohol. They give chocolate its flavor, and soil the power to grow. I'm here to tell you that the next 100 years will feature
these microscopic creatures solving more of our problems. And we have a lot of problems
to choose from. We've got the mundane:
bad-smelling clothes or bland food. And we've got the monumental: disease, pollution, war. And so this is my mission: to not just catalog
the microscopic life around us, but to find out what it's uniquely
well-suited to help us with. Here's an example. We started with a pest, a wasp that lives on many of our homes. Inside that wasp, we plucked out
a little-known microorganism species with a unique ability: it could make beer. This is a trait that only
a few species on this planet have. In fact, all commercially produced
beer you've ever had likely came from one of only
three microorganism species. Yet our species, it could make
a beer that tasted like honey, and it could also make
a delightfully tart beer. In fact, this microorganism species
that lives in the belly of a wasp, it could make a valuable sour beer better than any other species
on this planet. There are now four species
that produce commercial beer. Where you used to see a pest, now think of tasting
your future favorite beer. As a second example, I worked with researchers
to dig in the dirt in people's backyards. There, we uncovered a microorganism
that could make novel antibiotics, antibiotics that can kill
the world's worst superbugs. This was an awesome thing to find, but here's the secret: for the last 60 years, most of the antibiotics on the market have come from similar soil bacteria. Every day, you and I
and everyone in this room and on this planet, are saved by similar soil bacteria
that produce most of our antibiotics. Where you used to see dirt, now think of medication. Perhaps my favorite example
comes from colleagues who are studying
a pond scum microorganism, which is tragically named after
the cow dung it was first found in. It's pretty unremarkable
and would be unworthy of discussion, except that the researchers found
that if you feed it to mice, it vaccinates against PTSD. It vaccinates against fear. Where you used to see pond scum,
now think of hope. There are so many more microbial examples that I don't have time
to talk about today. I gave you examples of solutions
that came from just three species, but imagine what those other
100,000 species in your dust bunnies might be able to do. In the future, they might be able
to make you sexier or smarter or perhaps live longer. So I want you to look
at your finger again. Think about all those
microscopic creatures that are unknown. Think about in the future
what they might be able to do or make or whose life they might be able to save. How does your finger feel right now? A little bit powerful? That's because you're feeling the future. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I want you to touch your face. Go on. What do you feel? Soft? Squishy? It's you, right? You're feeling you? Well, it's not quite true. You're actually feeling
thousands of microscopic creatures that live on our face and fingers. You're feeling some of the fungi that drifted down
from the air ducts today. They set off our allergies and smell of mildew. You're feeling some
of the 100 billion bacterial cells that live on our skin. They've been munching away
at your skin oils and replicating, producing the smells of body odor. You're likely even touching
the fecal bacteria that sprayed onto you the last time
you flushed a toilet, or those bacteria that live
in our water pipes and sprayed onto you
with your last shower. Sorry. (Laughter) You're probably even giving
a microscopic high five to the two species of mites
that live on our faces, on all of our faces. They've spent the night
squirming across your face and having sex on the bridge of your nose. (Laughter) Many of them are now leaking
their gut contents onto your pores. (Laughter) Now look at your finger. How's it feel? Gross? In desperate need of soap or bleach? That's how you feel now, but it's not going to be
how you feel in the future. For the last 100 years, we've had an adversarial relationship with the microscopic life nearest us. If I told you there was
a bug in your house or bacteria in your sink, there was a human-devised
solution for that, a product to eradicate, exterminate, disinfect. We strive to remove most
of the microscopic life in our world now. But in doing so, we're ignoring
the best source of new technology on this planet. The last 100 years have featured
human solutions to microbial problems, but the next 100 years will feature
microbial solutions to human problems. I'm a scientist, and I work
with researchers at North Carolina State University
and the University of Colorado to uncover the microscopic
life that is nearest us, and that's often in our most intimate
and boring environments, be it under our couches, in our backyards, or in our belly buttons. I do this work because it turns out
that we know very little about the microscopic life
that's nearest us. As of a few years ago,
no scientist could tell you what bugs or microorganisms
live in your home -- your home, the place you know
better than anywhere else. And so I and teams of others are armed with Q-tips and tweezers and advanced DNA techniques to uncover the microscopic

**Transcript**:
4,300 years ago 
in ancient Sumer, the most powerful person in the city of Ur
was banished to wander the vast desert. Her name was Enheduanna. She was the high priestess of the moon god
and history’s first known author. By the time of her exile, she had written 
42 hymns and three epic poems— and Sumer hadn’t heard the last of her. Enheduanna lived 1,700 years 
before Sappho, 1,500 years before Homer, and about 500 years before 
the biblical patriarch Abraham. She was born in Mesopotamia, the land 
between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, and the birthplace of the first cities 
and high cultures. Her father was King Sargon the Great, 
history’s first empire builder, who conquered the independent city-states 
of Mesopotamia under a unified banner. Sargon was a northern Semite 
who spoke Akkadian, and the older Sumerian cities in the south
viewed him as a foreign invader. They frequently revolted to regain 
their independence, fracturing his new dynasty. To bridge the gap between cultures, Sargon appointed his only daughter, 
Enheduanna, as high priestess in the empire’s most important temple. Female royalty traditionally 
served religious roles, and she was educated to read 
and write in both Sumerian and Akkadian, and make mathematical calculations. The world's first writing started in Sumer
as a system of accounting, allowing merchants to communicate 
over long distances with traders abroad. Their pictogram system of record keeping 
developed into a script about 300 years 
before Enheduanna’s birth. This early writing style, 
called cuneiform, was written with a reed stylus pressed 
into soft clay to make wedge-shaped marks. But until Enheduanna, this writing mostly took the form 
of record keeping and transcription, rather than original works attributable 
to individual writers. Enheduanna’s Ur was a city 
of 34,000 people with narrow streets, multi-storied brick homes, granaries, 
and irrigation. As high priestess, Enheduanna 
managed grain storage for the city, oversaw hundreds of temple workers, 
interpreted sacred dreams, and presided over the monthly 
new moon festival and rituals celebrating the equinoxes. Enheduanna set about unifying 
the older Sumerian culture with the newer Akkadian civilization. To accomplish this, 
she wrote 42 religious hymns that combined both mythologies. Each Mesopotamian city 
was ruled by a patron deity, so her hymns were dedicated 
to the ruling god of each major city. She praised the city’s temple, 
glorified the god’s attributes, and explained the god’s relationship 
to other deities within the pantheon. In her writing, 
she humanized the once aloof gods— now they suffered, fought, loved, 
and responded to human pleading. Enheduanna’s most valuable 
literary contribution was the poetry she wrote to Inanna, 
goddess of war and desire, the divinely chaotic energy 
that gives spark to the universe. Inanna delighted in all forms 
of sexual expression and was considered so powerful that 
she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could 
be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of 
the pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time 
an author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the first time writing is used 
to explore deep, private emotions. After the death of Enheduanna’s father, 
King Sargon, a general took advantage 
of the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family,
Enheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, 
the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising 
and restored his aunt as high priestess. In total, Enheduanna served 
as high priestess for 40 years. After her death, 
she became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied, 
and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems influenced 
the Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today, Enheduanna’s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have 
stood the test of time.

she transcended gender boundaries, as did her earthly attendants, who could 
be prostitutes, eunuchs or cross-dressers. Enheduanna placed Inanna at the top of 
the pantheon as the most powerful deity. Her odes to Inanna mark the first time 
an author writes using the pronoun “I,” and the first time writing is used 
to explore deep, private emotions. After the death of Enheduanna’s father, 
King Sargon, a general took advantage 
of the power vacuum and staged a coup. As a powerful member of the ruling family,
Enheduanna was a target, and the general exiled her from Ur. Her nephew, 
the legendary Sumerian king Naram-Sin, ultimately crushed the uprising 
and restored his aunt as high priestess. In total, Enheduanna served 
as high priestess for 40 years. After her death, 
she became a minor deity, and her poetry was copied, studied, 
and performed throughout the empire for over 500 years. Her poems influenced 
the Hebrew Old Testament, the epics of Homer, and Christian hymns. Today, Enheduanna’s legacy still exists, on clay tablets that have 
stood the test of time.

**Transcript**:
In 1165, copies of a strange letter began 
to circulate throughout Western Europe. It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel 
and the Fountain of Youth— all ruled over by the letter’s 
mysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary
king never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom 
and its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European
leaders for the next 400 years. Prester John’s myth would propel 
the age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy, 
and indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, 
Europe was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what 
they regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith 
outside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim 
communities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian
kingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested
in rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous 
Muslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including
converted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory 
traveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled 
gaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced
with a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared 
the Crusader’s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by 
this so-called “Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author 
remains unknown, its stereotypes about the East 
and alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins 
as European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth 
was too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing 
the location of his mythical kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, 
European missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren’t searching for 
the letter’s author, who would have been over a century old; 
but rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John 
was briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols
were largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes 
to the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these explorers 
went south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors 
quickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted 
to Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland 
fit perfectly into Prester John’s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa 
for the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy 
finally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received 
their European guests, who were eager to do business 
with the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially 
confused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize 
the diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part 
of Prester John’s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced
an alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years after the European 
letter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership 
was quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported 
by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped 
Ethiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not 
the powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant 
Roman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect 
of Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert 
the people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, 
Ethiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John 
slowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made 
history despite having never existed.

**Transcript**:
In 1165, copies of a strange letter began 
to circulate throughout Western Europe. It spoke of a fantastical realm, containing the Tower of Babel 
and the Fountain of Youth— all ruled over by the letter’s 
mysterious author: Prester John. Today, we know that this extraordinary
king never existed. But the legend of this mythical kingdom 
and its powerful ruler would impact the decisions of European
leaders for the next 400 years. Prester John’s myth would propel 
the age of exploration, inspire intercontinental diplomacy, 
and indirectly begin a civil war. When Prester John’s letter appeared, 
Europe was embroiled in the Crusades. In this series of religious wars, Europeans campaigned to seize what 
they regarded as the Christian Holy Land. The Church vilified any faith 
outside of Christianity, including that of the Jewish and Muslim 
communities populating the region. Crusaders were eager to find Christian
kingdoms to serve as allies in their war. And they were particularly interested
in rumors of a powerful Christian king who had defeated an enormous 
Muslim army in the Far East. In fact, it was a Mongol horde including
converted Christian tribes that had routed the army. But news of this victory 
traveled unreliably. Merchants and emissaries filled 
gaps in the story with epic poems and Biblical fragments. By the time the story reached Europe, the Mongol horde had been replaced
with a great Christian army, commanded by a king who shared 
the Crusader’s vision of marching on Jerusalem. And when a letter allegedly written by 
this so-called “Prester John” appeared, European rulers were thrilled. While the letter’s actual author 
remains unknown, its stereotypes about the East 
and alignment with European goals indicate it was a Western forgery. But despite the letter’s obvious origins 
as European propaganda, the appeal of Prester John’s myth 
was too great for the Crusaders to ignore. Before long, European mapmakers were guessing 
the location of his mythical kingdom. In the 13th and 14th centuries, 
European missionaries went East, along the newly revived Silk Road. They weren’t searching for 
the letter’s author, who would have been over a century old; 
but rather, for his descendants. The title of Prester John 
was briefly identified with several Central Asian rulers, but it soon became clear that the Mongols
were largely non-Christian. And as their Empire began to decline, Europeans began pursuing alternate routes 
to the Far East, and new clues to Prester John’s location. At the same time these explorers 
went south, Ethiopian pilgrims began traveling north. In Rome, these visitors 
quickly attracted the interest of European scholars and cartographers. Since Ethiopia had been converted 
to Christianity in the 4th century, the stories of their African homeland 
fit perfectly into Prester John’s legend. Portuguese explorers scoured Africa 
for the kingdom, until a mix of confusion and diplomacy 
finally turned myth into reality. The Ethiopians graciously received 
their European guests, who were eager to do business 
with the ruler they believed to be Prester John. Though the Ethiopians were initially 
confused by the Portuguese’s unusual name for their Emperor, they were savvy enough to recognize 
the diplomatic capital it afforded them. The Ethiopian diplomats played the part 
of Prester John’s subjects, and the Portuguese triumphantly announced
an alliance with the fabled sovereign— over 350 years after the European 
letter had begun the search. But this long-awaited partnership 
was quickly tested. A decade later, the Sultanate of Adal, a regional power supported 
by the Ottoman Empire, invaded Ethiopia. The Portuguese sent troops that helped 
Ethiopians win this conflict. But by this time, it was clear that Ethiopia was not 
the powerful ally Europe had hoped. Worse still, the increasingly intolerant 
Roman Catholic Church now deemed the Ethiopian sect 
of Christianity heretical. Their subsequent attempts to convert 
the people they once revered as ideal Christians would eventually spark a civil war, and in the 1630s, 
Ethiopia cut ties with Europe. Over the next two centuries, the legend of Prester John 
slowly faded into oblivion— ending the reign of a king who made 
history despite having never existed.

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --

about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess

very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact

there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again

**Transcript**:
Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping 
from tree branches. The writer blamed their deaths 
on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed 
on a nearby marsh. The letter was the push 
Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists 
and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide 
posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries 
through government contacts from her years working 
in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced 
the voices of spring?” In 1962, Carson published her findings 
in "Silent Spring." Her book documented 
the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature 
and human health. "Silent Spring" immediately drew both 
applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks 
on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist 
and writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her career 
as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology 
at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school 
before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father 
and sister. Carson found part time work 
with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program 
on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could 
hold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, 
and in 1936, she became the second woman 
to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published 
the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations
on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated 
with a wide audience. In "Silent Spring," 
Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions 
threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during 
World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers 
from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed 
in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants 
in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately,
but did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this and other mishaps, 
the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies 
extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public 
awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how 
the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution 
of resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development
of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time 
it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues 
of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT 
might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences 
for future generations. The response to "Silent Spring" 
was explosive. For many people the book 
was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson 
hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects 
posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture 
Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children 
was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson 
as “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer 
alluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” 
aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.” In reality, Carson had focused 
on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, 
while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief 
that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people 
to cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, 
but of ourselves.” Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after 
the publication of "Silent Spring." Her work galvanized a generation 
of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure 
from environmentalists, Congress passed 
the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate
environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created 
the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued 
a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson 
continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact 
of her writing.

**Transcript**:
In 1958, Rachel Carson received a letter describing songbirds suddenly dropping 
from tree branches. The writer blamed their deaths 
on a pesticide called DDT that exterminators had sprayed 
on a nearby marsh. The letter was the push 
Carson needed to investigate DDT. She had already heard from scientists 
and conservationists who were worried that rampant use of the pesticide 
posed a threat to fish, birds, and possibly humans. She began to make inquiries 
through government contacts from her years working 
in the United States Bureau of Fisheries. She asked: “what has already silenced 
the voices of spring?” In 1962, Carson published her findings 
in "Silent Spring." Her book documented 
the misuse of chemicals and their toll on nature 
and human health. "Silent Spring" immediately drew both 
applause and impassioned dissent— along with vicious personal attacks 
on the author. How did this mild-mannered biologist 
and writer ignite such controversy? Carson began her career 
as a hardworking graduate student, balancing her studies in biology 
at John Hopkins University with part time jobs. Still, she had to leave school 
before completing her doctorate to provide for her ailing father 
and sister. Carson found part time work 
with the Bureau of Fisheries writing for a radio program 
on marine biology. Her ability to write materials that could 
hold the general public’s attention impressed her superiors, 
and in 1936, she became the second woman 
to be hired at the Bureau full time. In 1941, she published 
the first of three books on the ocean, combining science with lyrical meditations
on underwater worlds. These explorations resonated 
with a wide audience. In "Silent Spring," 
Carson turned her attention to the ways human actions 
threaten the balance of nature. DDT was originally used during 
World War II to shield crops from insects and protect soldiers 
from insect-borne diseases. After the war, it was routinely sprayed 
in wide swaths to fight pests, often with unforeseen results. One attempt to eradicate fire ants 
in the southern U.S. killed wildlife indiscriminately,
but did little to eliminate the ants. In spite of this and other mishaps, 
the US Department of Agriculture and chemical companies 
extolled the benefits of DDT. There was little regulation or public 
awareness about its potential harm. But Carson showed how 
the overuse of chemicals led to the evolution 
of resistant species— which, in turn, encouraged the development
of deadlier chemicals. Since DDT does not dissolve in water, she asserted that over time 
it would accumulate in the environment, the bodies of insects, the tissues 
of animals who consume those insects, and eventually humans. She suggested that exposure to DDT 
might alter the structure of genes, with unknown consequences 
for future generations. The response to "Silent Spring" 
was explosive. For many people the book 
was a call to regulate substances capable of catastrophic harm. Others objected that Carson 
hadn’t mentioned DDT’s role controlling the threat insects 
posed to human health. Former Secretary of Agriculture 
Ezra Taft Benson demanded to know “why a spinster with no children 
was so concerned about genetics?” and dismissed Carson 
as “probably a Communist.” A lawyer for a pesticide manufacturer 
alluded to Carson and her supporters as “sinister influences” 
aiming to paint businesses as “immoral.” In reality, Carson had focused 
on the dangers of chemicals because they weren’t widely understood, 
while the merits were well publicized. She rejected the prevailing belief 
that humans should and could control nature. Instead, she challenged people 
to cultivate “maturity and mastery, not of nature, 
but of ourselves.” Carson died of cancer in 1964, only two years after 
the publication of "Silent Spring." Her work galvanized a generation 
of environmental activists. In 1969, under pressure 
from environmentalists, Congress passed 
the National Environmental Policy Act that required federal agencies to evaluate
environmental impacts of their actions. To enforce the act, President Richard Nixon created 
the Environmental Protection Agency. And in 1972, the EPA issued 
a partial ban on the use of DDT. Long after her death, Rachel Carson 
continued to advocate for nature through the lingering impact 
of her writing.

**Transcript**:
Antibiotics: behind the scenes, 
they enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything 
from surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are chemicals 
that prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria 
have become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, 
we’ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead 
of the problem. But first, how did we 
get into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic 
was penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize 
acceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance 
had the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria 
already began to appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies 
countered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful— 
and highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics 
were often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones 
had been broadly applicable. This isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses 
of these drugs could be sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, 
antibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections 
they had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, 
which is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, 
companies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood pressure 
and cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants 
and anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, 
these drugs more profitable. By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes 
of antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire 
resistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information 
between individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant 
to many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains 
are resistant to all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use 
of existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new 
and existing drugs, and find new ways to fight 
bacterial infections. The largest consumer 
of antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only 
to treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s exposure 
to the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity 
to develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals, 
like salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass 
to us through the food chain and spread through international trade 
and travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising 
new compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi 
have evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments— meaning they often contain 
antibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage 
over certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics 
with molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance 
is through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules
that block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria 
but don’t affect humans, are one promising new avenue 
to combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections,
meanwhile, can help prevent disease 
in the first place. The biggest challenge to all 
these approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate 
across the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable 
that many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies 
that successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt, 
like the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques 
like phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem 
as traditional antibiotics: if they’re working well, 
they’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance 
in the long term, we’ll need to use 
new antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits 
for their creators even further. One possible solution is to shift profits 
away from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom 
is testing a model where healthcare providers 
purchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways 
to incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still 
in the early stages. Countries around the world 
will need to do much more— but with enough investment 
in antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance.

**Transcript**:
Antibiotics: behind the scenes, 
they enable much of modern medicine. We use them to cure infectious diseases, but also to safely facilitate everything 
from surgery to chemotherapy to organ transplants. Without antibiotics, even routine medical procedures 
can lead to life-threatening infections. And we’re at risk of losing them. Antibiotics are chemicals 
that prevent the growth of bacteria. Unfortunately, some bacteria 
have become resistant to all currently available antibiotics. At the same time, 
we’ve stopped discovering new ones. Still, there’s hope that we can get ahead 
of the problem. But first, how did we 
get into this situation? The first widely used antibiotic 
was penicillin, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. In his 1945 Nobel Prize 
acceptance speech, Fleming warned that bacterial resistance 
had the potential to ruin the miracle of antibiotics. He was right: in the 1940s and 50s, resistant bacteria 
already began to appear. From then until the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies 
countered the problem of resistance by discovering many new antibiotics. At first this was a highly successful— 
and highly profitable— enterprise. Over time, a couple things changed. Newly discovered antibiotics 
were often only effective for a narrow spectrum of infections, whereas the first ones 
had been broadly applicable. This isn’t a problem in itself, but it does mean that fewer doses 
of these drugs could be sold— making them less profitable. In the early days, 
antibiotics were heavily overprescribed, including for viral infections 
they had no effect on. Scrutiny around prescriptions increased, 
which is good, but also lowered sales. At the same time, 
companies began to develop more drugs that are taken over a patient’s lifetime, like blood pressure 
and cholesterol medications, and later anti-depressants 
and anti-anxiety medications. Because they are taken indefinitely, 
these drugs more profitable. By the mid-1980s, no new chemical classes 
of antibiotics were discovered. But bacteria continued to acquire 
resistance and pass it along by sharing genetic information 
between individual bacteria and even across species. Now bacteria that are resistant 
to many antibiotics are common, and increasingly some strains 
are resistant to all our current drugs. So, what can we do about this? We need to control the use 
of existing antibiotics, create new ones, combat resistance to new 
and existing drugs, and find new ways to fight 
bacterial infections. The largest consumer 
of antibiotics is agriculture, which uses antibiotics not only 
to treat infections but to promote the growth of food animals. Using large volumes of antibiotics increases the bacteria’s exposure 
to the antibiotics and therefore their opportunity 
to develop resistance. Many bacteria that are common in animals, 
like salmonella, can also infect humans, and drug-resistant versions can pass 
to us through the food chain and spread through international trade 
and travel networks. In terms of finding new antibiotics, nature offers the most promising 
new compounds. Organisms like other microbes and fungi 
have evolved over millions of years to live in competitive environments— meaning they often contain 
antibiotic compounds to give them a survival advantage 
over certain bacteria. We can also package antibiotics 
with molecules that inhibit resistance. One way bacteria develop resistance 
is through proteins of their own that degrade the drug. By packaging the antibiotic with molecules
that block the degraders, the antibiotic can do its job. Phages, viruses that attack bacteria 
but don’t affect humans, are one promising new avenue 
to combat bacterial infections. Developing vaccines for common infections,
meanwhile, can help prevent disease 
in the first place. The biggest challenge to all 
these approaches is funding, which is woefully inadequate 
across the globe. Antibiotics are so unprofitable 
that many large pharmaceutical companies have stopped trying to develop them. Meanwhile, smaller companies 
that successfully bring new antibiotics to market often still go bankrupt, 
like the American start up Achaogen. New therapeutic techniques 
like phages and vaccines face the same fundamental problem 
as traditional antibiotics: if they’re working well, 
they’re used just once, which makes it difficult to make money. And to successfully counteract resistance 
in the long term, we’ll need to use 
new antibiotics sparingly— lowering the profits 
for their creators even further. One possible solution is to shift profits 
away from the volume of antibiotics sold. For example, the United Kingdom 
is testing a model where healthcare providers 
purchase antibiotic subscriptions. While governments are looking for ways 
to incentivize antibiotic development, these programs are still 
in the early stages. Countries around the world 
will need to do much more— but with enough investment 
in antibiotic development and controlled use of our current drugs, we can still get ahead of resistance.

**Transcript**:
In their ramshackle hut 
on the edge of the woods, a husband and wife were in despair. The woman had just given birth 
to their thirteenth child, and the growing family was quickly 
running out of food and money. The father walked into the woods 
to ponder their problem. After hours spent wandering 
through the trees, he encountered two shadowy silhouettes. The first figure appeared 
to be the man’s God, while the second resembled the Devil. Both figures offered to lighten 
the man’s burden, and act as Godfather 
to his most recent child. But the man refused their offer— he wouldn’t entrust his son to those 
who passed judgment on human life. He ventured deeper 
into the tangled thicket. Here in the darkest part of the woods, 
the father made out a third figure. Sunken eyes stared out of its gaunt face, 
which broke into a crooked smile. This was Death himself, 
come to offer his services as Godfather. He promised to return 
when the child came of age, to bring him happiness and prosperity. The father— knowing that all people 
are equal in the eyes of Death— accepted his offer. Years later, when the child had grown 
into an ambitious young man, his skeletal Godfather 
came for his promised visit. In his gnarled hand 
he held a flask containing the cure for all human ailments. Death had brought this flask 
for his Godson, promising to make him a successful doctor. But the powerful potion 
came with very strict rules. If his Godson encountered a sick person and Death was hovering 
at the top of their bed, the doctor could heal them with 
just a waft of the antidote’s fumes. But if Death lingered 
at the foot of the bed, he’d already claimed the patient 
as his own— and the doctor could do nothing for them. In time, the doctor’s potent potion 
and uncanny instincts became known throughout the land. He grew rich and famous, casting off 
the hardships of his early life. When the king fell ill, he summoned 
the famous physician to treat him. The doctor swept into the palace, 
ready to show off his skills. But when he entered the king’s chamber, he was dismayed to see Death 
settled at the foot of the bed. The doctor desperately wanted the glory 
of saving the king— even if it meant deceiving his Godfather. And so, he swiftly spun the bed around 
and reversed Death’s position, leaving the doctor free 
to administer the antidote. Death was livid. He warned his arrogant Godson 
that if he ever cheated Death again, he would pay for it with his life. Death and the doctor 
continued their travels. After some time, the king’s messengers 
came to collect the doctor yet again. The princess was gravely ill, and the king had promised incredible 
riches to anyone who could cure her. The doctor approached the princesses’ 
chamber with gold in his eyes. But upon seeing the sleeping princess, 
his greed fell away. He was so struck by her grace, that he failed to notice 
Death lurking by her feet. He swiftly healed the princess, but before she could even utter 
her thanks, Death had dragged 
his lovesick Godson away. In an instant, 
the palace dissolved around them. The doctor found himself 
in an immense cave lined with countless quivering candles,
each representing the duration of a life. As punishment for his Godson’s 
foolish attempt to master mortality, Death whittled his candle 
down to its wick. Seeing his own dwindling light, the doctor felt the fear 
he’d often glimpsed in his patients’ eyes. Desperately, he begged Death to transfer 
his dying light onto a new candle. His Godfather considered the request— 
but the doctor’s betrayal was too great. He loosened his bony grip, 
and his Godson’s candle fell to the floor. Death stood motionless, his inscrutable face 
fixed on the sputtering flame— until all that was left of the doctor 
was a wisp of smoke.

**Transcript**:
Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night 
tears across the stage. She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections 
from Mozart’s beloved opera, "The Magic Flute." The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars above 
the instruments. Its melody rings out 
across thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance 
from a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice
can be heard so clearly, above the strains 
of dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics 
of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique 
of an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house 
originates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin 
or the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, 
which our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number 
of waves per second–– is how our brains determine 
the pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination 
of multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating 
at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears 
mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers 
additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down 
into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them 
is how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of frequencies 
that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates 
at twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times 
the fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments 
produce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material
changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes 
the first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials 
resonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument
its unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability 
to stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly 
attuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an opera singer’s 
power of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard 
voice parts— can produce notes 
with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations 
per second. Human ears are most sensitive 
to frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 
vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out 
the partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot 
where she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition 
from the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker 
at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing 
these partials is a distinctive ringing timbre 
called a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades 
to create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension 
in their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position 
of their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones 
while dampening others. Singers also increase their range 
of partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note 
slightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound 
that rings out over the instruments’ 
comparatively narrow vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques 
to boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity 
and perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect 
sound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage 
of these techniques, but different vocal signatures 
demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs 
to build up stamina to power through the composer’s 
four-hour epics. While bel canto singers require 
versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible 
for every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall 
or a shower stall, these techniques can turn 
un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces.

**Transcript**:
Gripped with vengeful passion, The Queen of the Night 
tears across the stage. She begins to sing her titular aria, one of the most famous sections 
from Mozart’s beloved opera, "The Magic Flute." The orchestra fills the hall with music, but the queen’s voice soars above 
the instruments. Its melody rings out 
across thousands of patrons, reaching seats 40 meters away— all without any assistance 
from a microphone. How is it possible that this single voice
can be heard so clearly, above the strains 
of dozens of instruments? The answer lies in the physics 
of the human voice, and the carefully honed technique 
of an expert opera singer. All the music in this opera house 
originates from the vibrations created by instruments— whether it’s the strings of a violin 
or the vocal folds of a performer. These vibrations send waves into the air, 
which our brains interpret as sound. The frequency of these vibrations–– specifically, the number 
of waves per second–– is how our brains determine 
the pitch of a single note. But in fact, every note we hear is actually a combination 
of multiple vibrations. Imagine a guitar string vibrating 
at its lowest frequency. This is called the fundamental, and this low pitch is what our ears 
mostly use to identify a note. But this lowest vibration triggers 
additional frequencies called overtones, which layer on top of the fundamental. These overtones break down 
into specific frequencies called harmonics, or partials— and manipulating them 
is how opera singers work their magic. Every note has a set of frequencies 
that comprise its harmonic series. The first partial vibrates 
at twice the frequency of the fundamental. The next partial is three times 
the fundamental’s frequency, and so on. Virtually all acoustic instruments 
produce harmonic series, but each instrument’s shape and material
changes the balance of its harmonics. For example, a flute emphasizes 
the first few partials, but in a clarinet’s lowest register, the odd-numbered partials 
resonate most strongly. The strength of various partials is part of what gives each instrument
its unique sonic signature. It also affects an instrument’s ability 
to stand out in a crowd, because our ears are more strongly 
attuned to some frequencies than others. This is the key to an opera singer’s 
power of projection. An operatic soprano— the highest of the four standard 
voice parts— can produce notes 
with fundamental frequencies ranging from 250 to 1,500 vibrations 
per second. Human ears are most sensitive 
to frequencies between 2,000 and 5,000 
vibrations per second. So if the singer can bring out 
the partials in this range, she can target a sensory sweet spot 
where she’s most likely to be heard. Higher partials are also advantageous because there’s less competition 
from the orchestra, whose overtones are weaker 
at those frequencies. The result of emphasizing 
these partials is a distinctive ringing timbre 
called a singer’s squillo. Opera singers work for decades 
to create their squillo. They can produce higher frequencies by modifying the shape and tension 
in their vocal folds and vocal tract. And by shifting the position 
of their tongues and lips, they accentuate some overtones 
while dampening others. Singers also increase their range 
of partials with vibrato— a musical effect in which a note 
slightly oscillates in pitch. This creates a fuller sound 
that rings out over the instruments’ 
comparatively narrow vibratos. Once they have the right partials, they employ other techniques 
to boost their volume. Singers expand their lung capacity 
and perfect their posture for consistent, controlled airflow. The concert hall helps as well, with rigid surfaces that reflect 
sound waves towards the audience. All singers take advantage 
of these techniques, but different vocal signatures 
demand different physical preparation. A Wagnerian singer needs 
to build up stamina to power through the composer’s 
four-hour epics. While bel canto singers require 
versatile vocal folds to vault through acrobatic arias. Biology also sets some limits— not every technique is feasible 
for every set of muscles, and voices change as singers age. But whether in an opera hall 
or a shower stall, these techniques can turn 
un-amplified voices into thundering musical masterpieces.
