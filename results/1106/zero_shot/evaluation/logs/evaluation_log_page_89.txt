**Transcript**:
GMOs are one of the most controversial areas of science. Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin are widely accepted, The debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture. Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently? Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs. Humans have been genetically modifing plants and animals for thousands of years. Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields. Maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal. So you did the smart thing, and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you. Traits suggest an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced. After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a so called "Genetically Modified Organism", or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want. Make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So, why are people concerned about them ? Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs. Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention, but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this, however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use. This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted, and traces of modified genes found in foreign crops. But GM plants can't run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves, and all crops have to be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones, to keep unintentional crossing at a minimum. But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally cross with a non-GMO, there's actually a more important question. Is food that comes from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible dangers, and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent. But don't just take it our word for it, the sources for this and other claims are in the video description. But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis, lets engineered plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide. Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming! Pesticide sprays could be washed off. While the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it's not a big deal. Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What's harmless to one species, might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us. Or take chocolate, it's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans. BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of certain insects; it's completely harmless for us. There's also the opposite approach. Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely, killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop. Here, we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business. Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means famers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside. That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and a business practice of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid, it's also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model. GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not a enemy in that fight, helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment. Let's look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often, whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides. Not only was this very expensive, Farmers also frequently got sick. The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them. This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improved, and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes, the GM approach is the only option. In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed. All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides, or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. The scientists are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients, like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional vitamins. On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants more resilient to climate change, plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions, making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air, like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its build-up pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once. The over use of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super-effective carbon collectors,  like the American chestnut tree, to mitigate and actually reverse climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit. The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now, with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only drastically change agriculture but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior. GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere. This video took more than 600 hours to make, which would be impossible without viewer support on Patreon.com.

**Transcript**:
It was the dawn of 1863, and London’s 
not-yet-opened subway system, the first of its kind in the world, 
had the city in an uproar. Digging a hole under the city 
and putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway
company of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than
100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground 
to travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction
and a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway 
was ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible 
congestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest 
and most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary, 
Charles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways 
under the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains 
throughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea
was impractical since the railroads at the time 
only had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway 
through the center of a city? The answer was a simple system 
called "cut and cover." Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole 
over the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition 
of buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went
under existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm 
flooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as 
the Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in 
to ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became 
a vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened 
next to the railroad, and the railway company 
even created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls
Court to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered 
80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town
running in tunnels, and suburban trains operating 
on the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted 
to be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with
buildings, sewers, and electric cables for the "cut and cover" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine 
called the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could 
bore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels 
through the London clay. These new lines, called tubes,
were at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than 
the "cut and cover" lines. This meant their construction 
didn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible 
to dig under buildings. The first tube line, 
the City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines 
were built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used 
to burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities 
in 55 countries using underground rails 
to combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson
and the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the number of people who traveled on the line on the first day.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall topic of the London subway system, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, as it deals with a specific fact about the subway system (the time it took to cover 80 kilometers). However, this is still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that specifically target the topic of the ground truth MCQ. In this case, a generated MCQ that asks about the number of people who traveled on the line on the first day would be a good match.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that target the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ.

through the center of a city? The answer was a simple system 
called "cut and cover." Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole 
over the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition 
of buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went
under existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm 
flooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as 
the Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in 
to ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became 
a vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened 
next to the railroad, and the railway company 
even created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls
Court to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered 
80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town
running in tunnels, and suburban trains operating 
on the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted 
to be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with
buildings, sewers, and electric cables for the "cut and cover" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine 
called the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could 
bore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels 
through the London clay. These new lines, called tubes,
were at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than 
the "cut and cover" lines. This meant their construction 
didn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible 
to dig under buildings. The first tube line, 
the City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines 
were built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used 
to burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities 
in 55 countries using underground rails 
to combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson
and the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track.

**Transcript**:
It was the dawn of 1863, and London’s 
not-yet-opened subway system, the first of its kind in the world, 
had the city in an uproar. Digging a hole under the city 
and putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway
company of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than
100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground 
to travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction
and a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway 
was ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible 
congestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest 
and most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary, 
Charles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways 
under the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains 
throughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea
was impractical since the railroads at the time 
only had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the length of the first line, which is related to the construction and development of the Metropolitan Railway. Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 asks about the time it took for London's subway system to cover 80 kilometers, which is also related to the development and expansion of the Metropolitan Railway.

Although the question content and options do not directly match, I would suggest that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent and relevance to the topic.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the number of people who traveled on the line on the first day.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall topic of the London subway system, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, as it deals with a specific fact about the subway system (the time it took to cover 80 kilometers). However, this is still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that specifically target the topic of the ground truth MCQ. In this case, a generated MCQ that asks about the number of people who traveled on the line on the first day would be a good match.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that target the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Once, a long time ago, there was a powerful hermit 
named Lok Ta Moni Eysei. He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest: whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply
wringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, 
and loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso 
collected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball 
unlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous 
and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess
so they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances 
and flew off, Ream Eyso resolved 
to take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air 
in search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun 
and attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would
never allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand 
in the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun 
against the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search
until he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she 
and her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students 
and rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear, 
refused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away
from her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through
nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, 
Mekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand 
but the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began 
to swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon,
Mekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes 
of lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose 
in wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air 
it cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds 
of water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, 
now blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what
she should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness 
and love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion 
and flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his 
strength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued 
to dance across the earth. Some drops fell on Vorachhun
and revived him, his skin golden like 
a rice field ready for harvest. Grabbing his magic dagger, he flew into the sky in search 
of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala.

**Transcript**:
Once, a long time ago, there was a powerful hermit 
named Lok Ta Moni Eysei. He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest: whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply
wringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, 
and loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso 
collected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball 
unlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous 
and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess
so they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances 
and flew off, Ream Eyso resolved 
to take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air 
in search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun 
and attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would
never allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand 
in the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun 
against the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search
until he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she 
and her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students 
and rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear, 
refused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away
from her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through
nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, 
Mekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand 
but the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began 
to swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon,
Mekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes 
of lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose 
in wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air 
it cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds 
of water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, 
now blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what
she should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness 
and love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion 
and flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his 
strength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued 
to dance across the earth. Some drops fell on Vorachhun
and revived him, his skin golden like 
a rice field ready for harvest. Grabbing his magic dagger, he flew into the sky in search 
of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala.

Most history books will tell you the Roman
Empire fell in the fifth century CE. But this would’ve come as a great surprise
to the millions of people who lived in the Roman Empire up
through the Middle Ages. This medieval Roman Empire, which we usually refer 
to today as the Byzantine Empire, began in 330 CE. That’s when Constantine,
the first Christian emperor, moved the capital of the Roman Empire 
to a new city called Constantinople, which he founded on the site of the
ancient Greek city Byzantion. When the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 and the Empire’s western provinces 
were conquered by barbarians, Constantine’s Eastern capital remained 
the seat of the Roman emperors. There, generations of emperors ruled 
for the next 11 centuries. Sharing continuity with 
the classical Roman Empire gave the Byzantine empire a technological
and artistic advantage over its neighbors, whom Byzantines considered barbarians. In the ninth century, 
visitors from beyond the frontier were astonished 
at the graceful stone arches and domes of the imperial palace in Constantinople. A pair of golden lions flanked 
the imperial throne. A hidden organ would make the lions 
roar as guests fell on their knees. Golden birds
sung from a nearby golden tree. Medieval Roman engineers 
even used hydraulic engines to raise the imperial throne 
high into the air. Other inherited aspects 
of ancient Roman culture could be seen in emperors’ clothing, from traditional military garb to togas, and in the courts, which continued to use Roman law. Working-class Byzantines would’ve also 
had similar lives to their Ancient Roman counterparts; many farmed or plied a specific trade, such as ceramics, leatherworking, fishing, weaving, or manufacturing silk. But, of course, the Byzantine Empire didn’t just rest 
on the laurels of Ancient Rome. Their artists innovated, creating vast 
mosaics and ornate marble carvings. Their architects constructed
numerous churches, one of which, called Hagia Sophia, had a dome so high it was said to be
hanging on a chain from heaven. The Empire was also home to great
intellectuals such as Anna Komnene. As imperial princess in the 12th century, Anna dedicated her life 
to philosophy and history. Her account of her father’s reign
is historians’ foremost source for Byzantine political history 
at the time of the first crusade. Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician, invented a system of beacons that ran the
width of the empire— what’s now Greece and Turkey. Stretching more than 700 kilometers, this system allowed the edge of the Empire
to warn the emperor of invading armies within one hour
of sighting them at the border. But their advances couldn’t 
protect the Empire forever. In 1203, an army of French 
and Venetian Crusaders made a deal with a man 
named Alexios Angelos. Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor, and promised the crusaders vast riches and support to help him retake 
the throne from his uncle. Alexios succeeded, but after a year, the population rebelled and Alexios 
himself was deposed and killed. So Alexios’s unpaid army turned 
their aggression on Constantinople. They lit massive fires, which destroyed countless works of ancient
and medieval art and literature, leaving about one-third 
of the population homeless. The city was reclaimed 50 years later 
by the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos, but his restored Empire never regained
all the territory the Crusaders had conquered. Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed
the Conqueror captured Constantinople, bringing a conclusive end 
to the Roman Empire. Despite the Ottoman conquest, many Greek-speaking inhabitants 
of the Eastern Mediterranean continued to call themselves Romans 
until the early 21st century. In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the term “Byzantine Empire” 
was first used. For Western Europeans, the Renaissance was about 
reconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity. And since the existence of a
medieval Roman Empire suggested there were Europeans 
who’d never lost touch with antiquity, Western Europeans wanted to draw 
clear lines between the ages. To better distinguish the classical, 
Latin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire from the medieval, 
Greek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire, scholars renamed 
the latter group Byzantines. And thus, 100 years after it had
fallen, the Byzantine Empire was born.

numerous churches, one of which, called Hagia Sophia, had a dome so high it was said to be
hanging on a chain from heaven. The Empire was also home to great
intellectuals such as Anna Komnene. As imperial princess in the 12th century, Anna dedicated her life 
to philosophy and history. Her account of her father’s reign
is historians’ foremost source for Byzantine political history 
at the time of the first crusade. Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician, invented a system of beacons that ran the
width of the empire— what’s now Greece and Turkey. Stretching more than 700 kilometers, this system allowed the edge of the Empire
to warn the emperor of invading armies within one hour
of sighting them at the border. But their advances couldn’t 
protect the Empire forever. In 1203, an army of French 
and Venetian Crusaders made a deal with a man 
named Alexios Angelos. Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor, and promised the crusaders vast riches and support to help him retake 
the throne from his uncle. Alexios succeeded, but after a year, the population rebelled and Alexios 
himself was deposed and killed. So Alexios’s unpaid army turned 
their aggression on Constantinople. They lit massive fires, which destroyed countless works of ancient
and medieval art and literature, leaving about one-third 
of the population homeless. The city was reclaimed 50 years later 
by the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos, but his restored Empire never regained
all the territory the Crusaders had conquered. Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed
the Conqueror captured Constantinople, bringing a conclusive end 
to the Roman Empire. Despite the Ottoman conquest, many Greek-speaking inhabitants 
of the Eastern Mediterranean continued to call themselves Romans 
until the early 21st century. In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the term “Byzantine Empire” 
was first used. For Western Europeans, the Renaissance was about 
reconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity. And since the existence of a
medieval Roman Empire suggested there were Europeans 
who’d never lost touch with antiquity, Western Europeans wanted to draw 
clear lines between the ages. To better distinguish the classical, 
Latin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire from the medieval, 
Greek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire, scholars renamed 
the latter group Byzantines. And thus, 100 years after it had
fallen, the Byzantine Empire was born.

**Transcript**:
A pungent blend of onions, cheese,
and cat urine with hints of... is that…wet goat? Most of us don’t need more than one whiff to identify that generally unpleasant, 
characteristic smell we call body odor. But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon influenced by our genetic makeup, 
age, diet, and hygiene. So what is this odor, exactly? Where does it come from? And can we do anything about it? To start, you just need two things 
to produce that familiar scent: your armpit’s own secretions and the bacteria that feed on them. Most people associate 
body odor with sweat, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle. Your body has millions of sweat glands, 
and they come in two major types: eccrine glands are found 
all over your skin and secrete mainly water and salt. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, 
develop at puberty in your armpits and a few other places on your body. The sweat they secrete 
is full of proteins and fats. By themselves, 
these secretions are usually odorless. That’s where bacteria come in. Every square centimeter of our bodies 
is covered with thousands of bacteria. Many microorganisms thrive 
in moist environments, like our armpits. There, you can find about a million 
bacteria per square centimeter, one of the highest concentrations 
anywhere on the skin. Lurking in this throng of microorganisms 
are species of Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, Micrococci, and others. When these bacteria feed on the proteins 
and fats in apocrine sweat, they turn the odorless compounds into
new ones that can smell very unpleasant. Some of the worst offenders may be 
sulfur-containing chemicals; those give body odor its oniony aroma. Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, 
adding notes of cheese. These molecules waft up from the armpit 
and can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations 
of less than one in a million. So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit, and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with. Your genes help determine 
what compounds you produce, and in what quantity, so everyone has a slightly different set. In fact, a gene variant that virtually 
eliminates body odor is common in people of East Asian descent. Adrenaline increases the ratio 
of apocrine to eccrine sweat, so body odor can be more intense
when you’re nervous. Bacterial composition and concentration 
also varies between individuals and plays a part. Even what you eat can have 
a small effect on how you smell. So how can we deal with body odor? Washing the armpits with soap and water 
helps but won’t remove all the bacteria since many are buried 
in deeper layers of the skin. Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial 
activity and mask odors at the same time. Antiperspirants work by forming tiny
gel plugs that block sweat glands, drying out the armpits. While we continue to battle body odor, 
scientists are trying to understand it. We don’t know why the brain often interprets these particular 
odors as off-putting. But some researchers have proposed 
that secretions from the armpit could have a positive function, too, like cementing social bonds and providing a means 
of chemical communication. We don’t know yet if that’s the case. For now, body odor seems to be just another smelly part 
of the human condition.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 does not have the exact same options as the ground truth MCQ, I will also consider other questions. Question 5 is also related to the factors that influence body odor production, but it does not specifically ask about the requirements for body odor production.

Considering the options and the question intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it would need to be modified to include the correct options.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but with a note that it is not an exact match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 3, as it discusses the role of bacteria in producing body odor, which is related to the origin of body odor. But since it doesn't directly address the location of body odor, it's not an exact match.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

However, a more suitable answer can be provided if the generated MCQs are revised or expanded to better match the ground truth MCQs.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 2 mentions apocrine glands, which are mentioned in the transcript as developing in the armpits and producing sweat that contributes to body odor. While it's still not a direct match, it's related to the topic of body odor origin.

Considering the available options, I would propose the following:

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ could be created by combining elements from Questions 2 and 3. However, if I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 2 or Question 3 could be considered the most similar, with a slight inclination towards Question 2 due to its mention of apocrine glands, which are specifically linked to the armpits.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can infer that the closest match would be related to the development or onset of body odor.

The closest match is Question 2, which mentions the type of sweat gland responsible for secreting sweat that is high in proteins and fats, and its relation to the development of body odor. However, it does not directly address the onset of body odor.

A more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the development or onset of body odor. Since such a question is not available, I will provide an answer based on the closest available option.

**Transcript**:
A pungent blend of onions, cheese,
and cat urine with hints of... is that…wet goat? Most of us don’t need more than one whiff to identify that generally unpleasant, 
characteristic smell we call body odor. But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon influenced by our genetic makeup, 
age, diet, and hygiene. So what is this odor, exactly? Where does it come from? And can we do anything about it? To start, you just need two things 
to produce that familiar scent: your armpit’s own secretions and the bacteria that feed on them. Most people associate 
body odor with sweat, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle. Your body has millions of sweat glands, 
and they come in two major types: eccrine glands are found 
all over your skin and secrete mainly water and salt. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, 
develop at puberty in your armpits and a few other places on your body. The sweat they secrete 
is full of proteins and fats. By themselves, 
these secretions are usually odorless. That’s where bacteria come in. Every square centimeter of our bodies 
is covered with thousands of bacteria. Many microorganisms thrive 
in moist environments, like our armpits. There, you can find about a million 
bacteria per square centimeter, one of the highest concentrations 
anywhere on the skin. Lurking in this throng of microorganisms 
are species of Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, Micrococci, and others. When these bacteria feed on the proteins 
and fats in apocrine sweat, they turn the odorless compounds into
new ones that can smell very unpleasant. Some of the worst offenders may be 
sulfur-containing chemicals; those give body odor its oniony aroma. Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, 
adding notes of cheese. These molecules waft up from the armpit 
and can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations 
of less than one in a million. So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit, and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with. Your genes help determine 
what compounds you produce, and in what quantity, so everyone has a slightly different set. In fact, a gene variant that virtually 
eliminates body odor is common in people of East Asian descent. Adrenaline increases the ratio 
of apocrine to eccrine sweat, so body odor can be more intense
when you’re nervous. Bacterial composition and concentration 
also varies between individuals and plays a part. Even what you eat can have 
a small effect on how you smell. So how can we deal with body odor? Washing the armpits with soap and water 
helps but won’t remove all the bacteria since many are buried 
in deeper layers of the skin. Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial 
activity and mask odors at the same time. Antiperspirants work by forming tiny
gel plugs that block sweat glands, drying out the armpits. While we continue to battle body odor, 
scientists are trying to understand it. We don’t know why the brain often interprets these particular 
odors as off-putting. But some researchers have proposed 
that secretions from the armpit could have a positive function, too, like cementing social bonds and providing a means 
of chemical communication. We don’t know yet if that’s the case. For now, body odor seems to be just another smelly part 
of the human condition.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the topic and the type of question, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match.

Question 3: What is the primary role of bacteria in the production of body odor? 
Options: A. To break down eccrine sweat, B. To feed on apocrine sweat and convert it into odor-causing compounds, C. To produce hormones that stimulate sweat glands, D. To eliminate body odor

This question is related to bacteria and their role in body odor production, which is also the topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the types of bacteria (Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, and Micrococci), whereas Question 3 asks about the role of bacteria in general.

If I had to choose an index, I would say 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, but please note that it's not a direct match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ, such as:

Question: What are Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, and Micrococci?
Options: A. Types of sweat glands, B. Types of bacteria, C. Human skin cell lines, D. Types of odors

This new MCQ would be a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s 427 BCE and the worst internal 
conflict ever to occur in the ancient Greek world 
is in its fourth year. The Peloponnesian War is being fought between the city-states of Athens and
Sparta, as well as their allies. The Athenians can’t match the formidable 
Spartan army on land. So they’ve abandoned the countryside and moved inside the walls surrounding 
their city and port, now provisioned by a superior fleet 
and extensive maritime empire. The cramped conditions have taken a toll and a recent plague wiped out 
a third of the population. But city life goes on. Archias and Dexileia live 
in the center of Athens. As a painter of high-class pottery, Archias is relatively well-off and takes 
great interest in the city’s affairs. Dexileia, on the other hand, can't
participate in politics or own property. The couple are grateful to the gods that 
three of their four children, a son and two daughters, have survived past infancy. Many parents see daughters as a liability since they require dowries 
to find husbands. But Archias is confident that his wealth will allow him to make good matches
for them without going bankrupt. Like many Athenians, 
the family owns slaves. Originally from Thrace,
they were captured in war. Thratta does most of the housework 
and helps raise the children. Philon is a paidagôgos, who supervises the son’s education, 
teaching him reading and writing. Archias is up early because there’s 
a meeting of the Ekklêsia, the assembly of citizens, taking place at dawn. Before setting out, he burns incense and pours a libation at the small shrine 
in the courtyard on behalf of his entire household. Dexileia will remain at home all day, 
teaching her daughters domestic skills. Later, she’ll retire to the inner 
courtyard for some fresh air. When Archias arrives at the agora, the civic and commercial heart 
of the city, he finds the square swarming 
with his fellow citizens, native-born adult males who 
have completed military training. Attached to the central monument is 
a noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda. Today, there’s only one item 
of discussion: what to do with the people of Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos where a revolt against Athenian rule 
has just been put down. The meeting takes place on a hill west 
of the acropolis known as the Pnyx. The word means “tightly packed," and the crowd of 5,000 citizens 
makes it clear why. The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling 
its boundary with pig’s blood and call for order. As everyone sits on benches 
facing the platform, the presiding officer opens the meeting 
with the words: “Tis agoreuein bouleutai?” “Who wishes to address the assembly?” One by one, citizens speak, some advising 
mercy, others bent on vengeance. A motion is proposed to execute 
all the Mytileneans and enslave their women and children because they betrayed their Athenian 
allies during a time of war. A majority raises their right hands 
in favor. Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads 
back to the agora to buy food and wine. Hundreds have gathered there 
to discuss the results, many unhappy with the decision. When Archias returns home, 
he tells Dexileia about the debate. She thinks that killing the innocent 
as well as the guilty is harsh and counterproductive, and tells him as much. Around dusk, Archias goes to 
a friend’s house for a symposium. The nine men drink wine and
discuss the meeting well into the night. Archias shares his wife’s opinion urging 
mercy, and his friends eventually agree. Before dawn, something 
unprecedented happens. Heralds circulate throughout Athens announcing the council 
has called another meeting. The second debate is equally heated, but a new resolution, 
to execute only the leaders of the revolt, narrowly passes. Yet there’s a problem – a ship with orders to carry out 
the first resolution was dispatched the previous day. And so another ship quickly sets sail 
to countermand the order – a race of democracy against time.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the name of the slave who supervises the education of Archias' son? 

However, the correct option in Question 5 is B. Philon, but it is stated that Philon is a paidagôgos, not a slave. 

A more accurate match would be a question that asks "Who teaches Archias's son?" or "Who supervises the education of Archias' son?" rather than "What is the name of the slave...". 

Considering the provided options, Question 5 is still the closest match, but with the understanding that the question could be improved for a more accurate match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. 

This is because both questions are asking about the location of the meeting or vote of the Assembly (Ekklêsia). The ground truth MCQ specifically asks "Where did the Assembly vote?" and the correct answer is "On the Pnyx". Similarly, Question 10 asks "What is the name of the hill where the meeting of the Ekklêsia takes place?" and the correct answer is also "Pnyx" (although it's not explicitly marked as the correct option in the generated MCQs). The content and intent of both questions are closely matched.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ is about what Archias did before setting out for the Ekklêsia. The most similar generated MCQ is:

Question 3: What is the occupation of Archias in ancient Athens? Options: A. Potter, B. Painter of high-class pottery, C. Paidagôgos, D. Soldier

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent or options.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

None, but if I had to choose, Question 6: What is the name of the assembly of citizens that Archias attends? Options: A. Ekklêsia, B. Agora, C. Pnyx, D. Acropolis

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ in that it mentions the Ekklêsia, which is the event that Archias is attending. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent or options.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose, I would choose Question 6 as the most similar.

**Transcript**:
It’s 427 BCE and the worst internal 
conflict ever to occur in the ancient Greek world 
is in its fourth year. The Peloponnesian War is being fought between the city-states of Athens and
Sparta, as well as their allies. The Athenians can’t match the formidable 
Spartan army on land. So they’ve abandoned the countryside and moved inside the walls surrounding 
their city and port, now provisioned by a superior fleet 
and extensive maritime empire. The cramped conditions have taken a toll and a recent plague wiped out 
a third of the population. But city life goes on. Archias and Dexileia live 
in the center of Athens. As a painter of high-class pottery, Archias is relatively well-off and takes 
great interest in the city’s affairs. Dexileia, on the other hand, can't
participate in politics or own property. The couple are grateful to the gods that 
three of their four children, a son and two daughters, have survived past infancy. Many parents see daughters as a liability since they require dowries 
to find husbands. But Archias is confident that his wealth will allow him to make good matches
for them without going bankrupt. Like many Athenians, 
the family owns slaves. Originally from Thrace,
they were captured in war. Thratta does most of the housework 
and helps raise the children. Philon is a paidagôgos, who supervises the son’s education, 
teaching him reading and writing. Archias is up early because there’s 
a meeting of the Ekklêsia, the assembly of citizens, taking place at dawn. Before setting out, he burns incense and pours a libation at the small shrine 
in the courtyard on behalf of his entire household. Dexileia will remain at home all day, 
teaching her daughters domestic skills. Later, she’ll retire to the inner 
courtyard for some fresh air. When Archias arrives at the agora, the civic and commercial heart 
of the city, he finds the square swarming 
with his fellow citizens, native-born adult males who 
have completed military training. Attached to the central monument is 
a noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda. Today, there’s only one item 
of discussion: what to do with the people of Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos where a revolt against Athenian rule 
has just been put down. The meeting takes place on a hill west 
of the acropolis known as the Pnyx. The word means “tightly packed," and the crowd of 5,000 citizens 
makes it clear why. The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling 
its boundary with pig’s blood and call for order. As everyone sits on benches 
facing the platform, the presiding officer opens the meeting 
with the words: “Tis agoreuein bouleutai?” “Who wishes to address the assembly?” One by one, citizens speak, some advising 
mercy, others bent on vengeance. A motion is proposed to execute 
all the Mytileneans and enslave their women and children because they betrayed their Athenian 
allies during a time of war. A majority raises their right hands 
in favor. Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads 
back to the agora to buy food and wine. Hundreds have gathered there 
to discuss the results, many unhappy with the decision. When Archias returns home, 
he tells Dexileia about the debate. She thinks that killing the innocent 
as well as the guilty is harsh and counterproductive, and tells him as much. Around dusk, Archias goes to 
a friend’s house for a symposium. The nine men drink wine and
discuss the meeting well into the night. Archias shares his wife’s opinion urging 
mercy, and his friends eventually agree. Before dawn, something 
unprecedented happens. Heralds circulate throughout Athens announcing the council 
has called another meeting. The second debate is equally heated, but a new resolution, 
to execute only the leaders of the revolt, narrowly passes. Yet there’s a problem – a ship with orders to carry out 
the first resolution was dispatched the previous day. And so another ship quickly sets sail 
to countermand the order – a race of democracy against time.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the location of Mytilene. Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 mentions Mytilene, but it asks about the topic of discussion at the meeting of the Ekklêsia, not the location of Mytilene.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the mention of Mytilene, I would choose Question 7. But please note that this is a weak match, as the question intent and content are not identical.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest that Question 3 is the closest match.

Question 3: According to Gever Tulley, what is one of the benefits of playing with fire for children? Options: A. It teaches them about the dangers of fire, B. It helps them develop their fine motor skills, C. It teaches them about basic principles such as intake, combustion, and exhaust, D. It helps them develop their social skills

Although the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the content and intent of the question are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the 3 working elements of fire, and Question 3 mentions "basic principles such as intake, combustion, and exhaust" as a benefit of playing with fire.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, but I would like to note that it's not an exact match.

in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ is about knife safety, and Question 5 is about the benefits of owning a pocketknife for children. While not identical, Question 5 is related to the topic of pocketknives and mentions the concept of responsibility, which is indirectly related to safety.

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly addresses knife safety. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with the benefits of throwing a spear for children, specifically mentioning the development of visualization skills and predictive ability, which are related to the areas of the brain and body mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (analytical, physical, parietal/frontal, attention, structural, and 3D understanding). 

However, it's worth noting that the options in the generated MCQ do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that includes options A and B from the ground truth MCQ, but such a question is not present in the provided list. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the possibility of injuries or accidents occurring during hands-on Makerspace education or Tinkering activities. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is related to the main argument made by Gever Tulley in his presentation, which includes the idea that children should be allowed to take risks and learn from their experiences.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ can be Question 5, which talks about the benefits of owning a pocketknife for children. In the options, it mentions "It gives them a sense of empowerment and responsibility," which is related to the idea that children may receive bumps, bruises, and or cuts during hands-on activities, but it is a part of the learning process.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, as it talks about the main argument of the presentation, which includes the idea of taking risks and learning from experiences.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the sharpness of objects that children under 10 should be able to use. While there isn't a direct match, Question 4 and Question 6 in the generated MCQs mention owning a pocketknife, which is related to the topic of sharp objects.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and content, I would suggest Question 2. This question is about the main argument made by Gever Tulley in his presentation, which includes the idea that children should be allowed to take risks and learn from their experiences, including handling sharp objects.

But since Question 2 does not directly address the sharpness of objects, I will choose a question that is more closely related to the topic.

In the transcript, Gever Tulley mentions that "we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10." This statement is closest to the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this statement. However, I can suggest that the closest generated MCQ would be one that mentions a pocketknife, as it is related to the topic of sharp objects.

Therefore, I will choose Question 4 as the closest match, although it is not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ is about knife safety, and Question 5 is about the benefits of owning a pocketknife for children. While not identical, Question 5 is related to the topic of pocketknives and mentions the concept of responsibility, which is indirectly related to safety.

However, a more relevant question would be one that directly addresses knife safety. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the possibility of injuries or accidents occurring during hands-on Makerspace education or Tinkering activities. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is related to the main argument made by Gever Tulley in his presentation, which includes the idea that children should be allowed to take risks and learn from their experiences.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ can be Question 5, which talks about the benefits of owning a pocketknife for children. In the options, it mentions "It gives them a sense of empowerment and responsibility," which is related to the idea that children may receive bumps, bruises, and or cuts during hands-on activities, but it is a part of the learning process.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, as it talks about the main argument of the presentation, which includes the idea of taking risks and learning from experiences.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Between you and the rest of the world 
lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ 
in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 
1.7 square meters of ground. Its purpose may seem obvious—
to keep our insides in. But a look beyond the surface reveals that it plays a surprising 
number of roles in our lives. First, the basics. Skin is the foundation 
of the integumentary system, which also incorporates your hair, 
nails, and specialized glands and nerves. Made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, skin’s thickness varies 
from 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest and up to four millimeters 
at its thickest. It also carries out three key functions: protecting, regulating, and sensing the world beyond its limits. On a daily basis, its huge surface 
processes hundreds, if not thousands, of physical sensations, relying mostly on large, 
pressure-sensitive skin components called Merkel cells. In your fingertips alone, there are 750 Merkel cells 
per each square-centimeter of skin, coupled with over 2,500 receptors
that give you your sense of touch. This surface is also the body’s first 
major line of defense. Without it, you’d be a soggy mass 
of tissue and fluids, fatally exposed to the elements. Skin effectively seals off your insides and also absorbs pressure and shock with flexible collagen 
that makes up most of its dermal layer. The epidermis is made up mainly 
of skin cells called keratinocytes that are completely replaced 
every four weeks. As new cells form at the base of the
epidermis, older ones are pushed up. When these cells move upwards, they’re filled with a hardened protein 
called keratin. Once they reach the surface, they form a tightly-overlapping, 
waterproof layer that’s difficult for invading 
microbes to breach. Any harmful microbes that make it 
into the epidermis will encounter Langerhans cells. This group of protective skin cells 
detects invaders and communicates their presence 
to resident immune system T-cells, which react by launching 
an immune response. A crucial feature of this immune defense is the several thousand 
species of microorganisms that inhabit the planes, folds, and crevices of your skin. These microbes, 
which include bacteria and fungi, thrive in the sebum, an oily substance that’s secreted 
onto the skin’s surface by sebaceous glands nestled
inside the dermis. These skin microbes keep the immune system
in a state of constant surveillance, ensuring that it’s ready to react 
if the body really is at risk. Beyond this protective role, your skin is also a sensory organ that
helps regulate your body’s temperature, two roles that are closely interlinked. Nerves detect whether your skin 
is warm or cold and communicate that
information to your brain. In return, the brain instructs
localized blood vessels to either expand if the body is too warm, releasing heat from 
the blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,
which retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's
blood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat
via ducts onto the surface, transferring heat out of the body. Hair can also be stimulated
to conserve or release body warmth. The average human 
has 5 million hair follicles embedded everywhere on the body except the palms of your hands 
and soles of your feet. Ninety to 150,000 of those 
are on your scalp, where they help shield
the large surface area of your head from physical damage and sunburn. When you're cold, tiny muscles 
called arrector pilli cause hair to stand upright
across the body. That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps
and it traps body heat close to your skin. Skin’s vast surface isn’t just a shield; it also enables us to interact 
and connect with the world. Its multifunctional layer cools us down
and keeps us warm. The integumentary system 
may be many things, but it’s certainly more than skin deep.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the components of the integumentary system. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, some of them do mention various components of the integumentary system, such as skin, hair, and glands.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3: "What are the three main layers of the skin?" Options: A. Epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, B. Dermis, hypodermis, and epidermal layer, C. Epidermis, dermal layer, and skin surface, D. Hypodermis, dermal layer, and skin cells.

Although this question does not directly ask about the components of the integumentary system, it does mention the skin, which is a key component of the system. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the components of the integumentary system.

the blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,
which retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's
blood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat
via ducts onto the surface, transferring heat out of the body. Hair can also be stimulated
to conserve or release body warmth. The average human 
has 5 million hair follicles embedded everywhere on the body except the palms of your hands 
and soles of your feet. Ninety to 150,000 of those 
are on your scalp, where they help shield
the large surface area of your head from physical damage and sunburn. When you're cold, tiny muscles 
called arrector pilli cause hair to stand upright
across the body. That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps
and it traps body heat close to your skin. Skin’s vast surface isn’t just a shield; it also enables us to interact 
and connect with the world. Its multifunctional layer cools us down
and keeps us warm. The integumentary system 
may be many things, but it’s certainly more than skin deep.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Between you and the rest of the world 
lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ 
in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 
1.7 square meters of ground. Its purpose may seem obvious—
to keep our insides in. But a look beyond the surface reveals that it plays a surprising 
number of roles in our lives. First, the basics. Skin is the foundation 
of the integumentary system, which also incorporates your hair, 
nails, and specialized glands and nerves. Made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, skin’s thickness varies 
from 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest and up to four millimeters 
at its thickest. It also carries out three key functions: protecting, regulating, and sensing the world beyond its limits. On a daily basis, its huge surface 
processes hundreds, if not thousands, of physical sensations, relying mostly on large, 
pressure-sensitive skin components called Merkel cells. In your fingertips alone, there are 750 Merkel cells 
per each square-centimeter of skin, coupled with over 2,500 receptors
that give you your sense of touch. This surface is also the body’s first 
major line of defense. Without it, you’d be a soggy mass 
of tissue and fluids, fatally exposed to the elements. Skin effectively seals off your insides and also absorbs pressure and shock with flexible collagen 
that makes up most of its dermal layer. The epidermis is made up mainly 
of skin cells called keratinocytes that are completely replaced 
every four weeks. As new cells form at the base of the
epidermis, older ones are pushed up. When these cells move upwards, they’re filled with a hardened protein 
called keratin. Once they reach the surface, they form a tightly-overlapping, 
waterproof layer that’s difficult for invading 
microbes to breach. Any harmful microbes that make it 
into the epidermis will encounter Langerhans cells. This group of protective skin cells 
detects invaders and communicates their presence 
to resident immune system T-cells, which react by launching 
an immune response. A crucial feature of this immune defense is the several thousand 
species of microorganisms that inhabit the planes, folds, and crevices of your skin. These microbes, 
which include bacteria and fungi, thrive in the sebum, an oily substance that’s secreted 
onto the skin’s surface by sebaceous glands nestled
inside the dermis. These skin microbes keep the immune system
in a state of constant surveillance, ensuring that it’s ready to react 
if the body really is at risk. Beyond this protective role, your skin is also a sensory organ that
helps regulate your body’s temperature, two roles that are closely interlinked. Nerves detect whether your skin 
is warm or cold and communicate that
information to your brain. In return, the brain instructs
localized blood vessels to either expand if the body is too warm, releasing heat from 
the blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,
which retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's
blood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat

**Transcript**:
With his harebrained schemes 
and asinine dealings with the gods, King Midas ruled the ancient kingdom 
of Phrygia with an uneven hand. He was known in Greek mythology 
as a rogue ruler whose antics bemused his people 
and distracted the gods. Midas spent his days 
in a stupor of splendor, spoiling himself and his beloved daughter
and gorging himself on feasts and wine. Unsurprisingly, he felt 
an affinity with Dionysus, god of wine, carnival, and performance. One day, Midas discovered a satyr dozing in his rose garden and drunk 
on more than the scent of flowers. Midas recognized the satyr 
as one of Dionysus’s followers and let him nurse 
his hangover at the palace. Pleased with the king’s hospitality,
Dionysus offered to grant him one wish. Midas cast a greedy eye 
over his surroundings. Despite the luxury in which he lived, no amount of precious jewels, finest silk 
or splendid decor felt like enough. His life, he thought, was lacking luster;
what he needed was more gold. The god sent the power to turn anything
the king touched to gold surging through Midas. Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions. At his lightest touch, 
the palace walls transformed, stone statues shone, and goblets glittered. He galloped through his home in a frenzy, handling each item until 
it took on a lustrous sheen. Soon the palace heaved with gold, and Midas’s delirious
laughter echoed off the walls. Exhausted and hungry from his rampage, Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from 
his newly gilded fruit bowl. But he nearly shattered his teeth, for the fruit had turned 
to metal in his mouth. When he picked up a loaf of bread, 
the crumbs hardened in his hand. Flinging himself onto 
his bed in frustration, Midas discovered his plush pillows 
had morphed into solid gold. Hearing his cries of frustration, 
his daughter entered the room. But when Midas reached out to her, he saw with horror that he had frozen her 
into a golden statue. Horrified at what he had done, Midas begged the gods 
to rid him of his power. Taking pity on the foolish king, Dionysus told Midas to wash 
his hands in the River Pactolus. When Midas reached into the river, 
the gold drained from his fingertips. Midas returned home 
to find his daughter alive and his palace back to normal, 
and he rejoiced. You’d think he would’ve learned 
his lesson, but just a few weeks later,
Midas blundered again, insulting the music and sun god Apollo 
when he declared Pan a greater musician. Apollo scornfully declared that the king 
must have the ears of an ass to make such a misjudgment,
and transformed Midas accordingly. Once again regretting his behavior, Midas kept his hairy ears 
hidden in public. They were seen only by his barber, who was sworn to secrecy during 
a very awkward grooming session. The barber stifled his laughter 
and fought the desire to tell someone, yet the secret consumed him. One day, he walked outside the city 
and dug a hole in the ground. Plunging his head into the earth, the desperate barber whispered,
“Midas has ass’s ears.” Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up in the spot where the barber 
had buried his words. When the wind blew, they carried the 
echoes of his whisper through the breeze: "Midas has ass’s ears." At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised
their heads in recognition and people chuckled to themselves 
at the follies of their king. With his golden touch and ass’s ears, 
Midas was not the most respected ruler. And where other leaders were honored 
through statues and temples, his people remembered him 
a little differently: in the depths of the glittering river 
and the rustle of the Phrygian wind.

**Transcript**:
With his harebrained schemes 
and asinine dealings with the gods, King Midas ruled the ancient kingdom 
of Phrygia with an uneven hand. He was known in Greek mythology 
as a rogue ruler whose antics bemused his people 
and distracted the gods. Midas spent his days 
in a stupor of splendor, spoiling himself and his beloved daughter
and gorging himself on feasts and wine. Unsurprisingly, he felt 
an affinity with Dionysus, god of wine, carnival, and performance. One day, Midas discovered a satyr dozing in his rose garden and drunk 
on more than the scent of flowers. Midas recognized the satyr 
as one of Dionysus’s followers and let him nurse 
his hangover at the palace. Pleased with the king’s hospitality,
Dionysus offered to grant him one wish. Midas cast a greedy eye 
over his surroundings. Despite the luxury in which he lived, no amount of precious jewels, finest silk 
or splendid decor felt like enough. His life, he thought, was lacking luster;
what he needed was more gold. The god sent the power to turn anything
the king touched to gold surging through Midas. Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions. At his lightest touch, 
the palace walls transformed, stone statues shone, and goblets glittered. He galloped through his home in a frenzy, handling each item until 
it took on a lustrous sheen. Soon the palace heaved with gold, and Midas’s delirious
laughter echoed off the walls. Exhausted and hungry from his rampage, Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from 
his newly gilded fruit bowl. But he nearly shattered his teeth, for the fruit had turned 
to metal in his mouth. When he picked up a loaf of bread, 
the crumbs hardened in his hand. Flinging himself onto 
his bed in frustration, Midas discovered his plush pillows 
had morphed into solid gold. Hearing his cries of frustration, 
his daughter entered the room. But when Midas reached out to her, he saw with horror that he had frozen her 
into a golden statue. Horrified at what he had done, Midas begged the gods 
to rid him of his power. Taking pity on the foolish king, Dionysus told Midas to wash 
his hands in the River Pactolus. When Midas reached into the river, 
the gold drained from his fingertips. Midas returned home 
to find his daughter alive and his palace back to normal, 
and he rejoiced. You’d think he would’ve learned 
his lesson, but just a few weeks later,
Midas blundered again, insulting the music and sun god Apollo 
when he declared Pan a greater musician. Apollo scornfully declared that the king 
must have the ears of an ass to make such a misjudgment,
and transformed Midas accordingly. Once again regretting his behavior, Midas kept his hairy ears 
hidden in public. They were seen only by his barber, who was sworn to secrecy during 
a very awkward grooming session. The barber stifled his laughter 
and fought the desire to tell someone, yet the secret consumed him. One day, he walked outside the city 
and dug a hole in the ground. Plunging his head into the earth, the desperate barber whispered,
“Midas has ass’s ears.” Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up in the spot where the barber 
had buried his words. When the wind blew, they carried the 
echoes of his whisper through the breeze: "Midas has ass’s ears." At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised
their heads in recognition and people chuckled to themselves 
at the follies of their king. With his golden touch and ass’s ears, 
Midas was not the most respected ruler. And where other leaders were honored 
through statues and temples, his people remembered him 
a little differently: in the depths of the glittering river 
and the rustle of the Phrygian wind.

**Transcript**:
Thor—son of Odin, god of thunder, 
and protector of mankind— struggled mightily against his greatest
challenge yet: opening a bag of food. It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants. Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and
even carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,
Skrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached 
a massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, 
they met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were 
the best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself 
the world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed. But when the contestants 
met in the center, Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones 
and even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions. The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess, which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves 
harder than ever before and changed the world 
in ways no one had expected.

Thor—son of Odin, god of thunder, 
and protector of mankind— struggled mightily against his greatest
challenge yet: opening a bag of food. It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants. Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and
even carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,
Skrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached

challenge yet: opening a bag of food. It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants. Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and

Skrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached 
a massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, 
they met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were 
the best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself 
the world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed. But when the contestants 
met in the center, Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones 
and even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions. The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess, which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is about Thjalfi trying to win the challenge he was presented with.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, as it mentions Thjalfi and a contest, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5, but with a note that it is not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that specifically target the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is about Thjalfi's attempts to win the challenge.

**Transcript**:
Thor—son of Odin, god of thunder, 
and protector of mankind— struggled mightily against his greatest
challenge yet: opening a bag of food. It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants. Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and
even carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,
Skrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached 
a massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, 
they met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were 
the best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself 
the world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed. But when the contestants 
met in the center, Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones 
and even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions. The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess, which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves 
harder than ever before and changed the world 
in ways no one had expected.

**Transcript**:
It was the Western Hemisphere’s 
largest empire ever, with a population 
of nearly 10 million subjects. Over an area of more 
than 900,000 square kilometers, its people built massive 
administrative centers, temples, and extensive road 
and canal systems. They did so in an inhospitable, 
extreme terrain, all without the use of wheels, 
horses, iron, or even written language. Yet within 100 years of its rise 
in the fifteenth century, the Inca Empire would be no more. According to legend, the ancestors of the Inca rulers 
were created by the sun god Inti, and they emerged
from a cave called Tambo Toco. Leading four brothers 
and four sisters was Ayar Manco, who carried a golden staff 
with instructions to find the place where 
it would sink into the ground, showing fertile soil. After many adventures 
and extensive searching, Ayar Manco and his siblings 
reached the Cuzco Valley, where the staff pierced the ground. After fighting off the fierce 
local native population, they founded their capital, and Ayar Manco became Manco Capac, 
the first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Incas first settled 
in this valley around 1200 CE. They remained a small kingdom until 1438, when they were nearly overrun 
by the neighboring Chanka tribe. The Inca king at this time, Viracocha, 
and his designated heir fled in fear, but one of his other sons remained and successfully rallied 
the city’s defenses. For his military skill, he became 
the ninth Inca ruler, assuming the name of Pachacuti, 
or "Cataclysm." Pachacuti expanded Inca rule 
throughout the Andes mountains, transforming the kingdom into 
an empire through extensive reforms. The empire’s territory was reorganized 
as Tahuantinsuyu, or "four quarters," with four divisions ruled 
by governors reporting to the king. Although the Inca had no writing, they used a complex system 
of knotted strings called quipu to record numbers 
and perhaps other information. A decimal-based bureaucracy 
enabled systematic and efficient taxation 
of the empire’s subjects. In return, the empire provided security, 
infrastructure, and sustenance, with great storehouses containing 
necessities to be used when needed. Great terraces and irrigation works 
were built and various crops were grown in 
at different altitudes to be transported all over the empire. And it was during Pachacuti’s reign that the famous estate 
of Machu Picchu was constructed. Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca continued 
the empire’s military expansion, and he eventually became ruler
in 1471 CE. By the end of his reign, the empire 
covered much of western South America. Topa’s son Huayna Capac 
succeeded him in 1493. But the new ruler’s distant military 
campaigns strained the social fabric. And in 1524, Huayna Capac 
was stricken by fever. Spanish conquistadors had arrived 
in the Caribbean some time before, bringing diseases to which 
the native peoples had no resistance. Millions died in the outbreak, including Huayna Capac
and his designated heir. The vacant throne ignited a civil war
between two of the surviving brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, greatly weakening the empire. In 1532, after finally winning 
the Inca civil war, Atahualpa and his army 
encountered the European invaders. Although greatly outnumbered, Francisco Pizarro 
and his small group of conquistadors stunned the king’s much larger force 
with guns and horses, neither of which they had seen before. Atahualpa was taken captive 
and killed about a year later. The Spanish conquerors 
were awed by the capital of Cuzco. Pizarro described it as so beautiful that
“it would be remarkable even in Spain.” Though the capital had fallen and the native population had been
destroyed by civil war and disease, some Incas fell back to 
a new capital at Vilcabamba and resisted for the next 40 years. But by 1572, the Spaniards had destroyed 
all remaining resistance along with much of the Incas’ physical 
and cultural legacy. Thus, the great Inca empire fell 
even faster than it had risen.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses the organization or structure of the Inca Empire.

The closest match is not present in the list of generated MCQs provided. However, if I had to choose one based on the information about the empire's organization, I would look for a question that deals with the empire's divisions or administrative structure.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will select the generated MCQ that deals with the Inca Empire's administrative system, which is:

Question 4: What was the name of the system used by the Incas to record numbers and other information? Options: A. Quipu, B. Tahuantinsuyu, C. Machu Picchu, D. Cuzco Correct Option: None

Although this question does not directly ask about the empire's divisions, option B, "Tahuantinsuyu," refers to the empire's four divisions. However, please note that this is not a direct match.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the empire's divisions, such as:

"What was the Inca Empire divided into?" or "How many major parts was the Inca Empire divided into?"

Since such a question is not present in the list, I will provide the index of the closest match, which is:

4

Keep in mind that this is not a direct match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be required to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
It was the Western Hemisphere’s 
largest empire ever, with a population 
of nearly 10 million subjects. Over an area of more 
than 900,000 square kilometers, its people built massive 
administrative centers, temples, and extensive road 
and canal systems. They did so in an inhospitable, 
extreme terrain, all without the use of wheels, 
horses, iron, or even written language. Yet within 100 years of its rise 
in the fifteenth century, the Inca Empire would be no more. According to legend, the ancestors of the Inca rulers 
were created by the sun god Inti, and they emerged
from a cave called Tambo Toco. Leading four brothers 
and four sisters was Ayar Manco, who carried a golden staff 
with instructions to find the place where 
it would sink into the ground, showing fertile soil. After many adventures 
and extensive searching, Ayar Manco and his siblings 
reached the Cuzco Valley, where the staff pierced the ground. After fighting off the fierce 
local native population, they founded their capital, and Ayar Manco became Manco Capac, 
the first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Incas first settled 
in this valley around 1200 CE. They remained a small kingdom until 1438, when they were nearly overrun 
by the neighboring Chanka tribe. The Inca king at this time, Viracocha, 
and his designated heir fled in fear, but one of his other sons remained and successfully rallied 
the city’s defenses. For his military skill, he became 
the ninth Inca ruler, assuming the name of Pachacuti, 
or "Cataclysm." Pachacuti expanded Inca rule 
throughout the Andes mountains, transforming the kingdom into 
an empire through extensive reforms. The empire’s territory was reorganized 
as Tahuantinsuyu, or "four quarters," with four divisions ruled 
by governors reporting to the king. Although the Inca had no writing, they used a complex system 
of knotted strings called quipu to record numbers 
and perhaps other information. A decimal-based bureaucracy 
enabled systematic and efficient taxation 
of the empire’s subjects. In return, the empire provided security, 
infrastructure, and sustenance, with great storehouses containing 
necessities to be used when needed. Great terraces and irrigation works 
were built and various crops were grown in 
at different altitudes to be transported all over the empire. And it was during Pachacuti’s reign that the famous estate 
of Machu Picchu was constructed. Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca continued 
the empire’s military expansion, and he eventually became ruler
in 1471 CE. By the end of his reign, the empire 
covered much of western South America. Topa’s son Huayna Capac 
succeeded him in 1493. But the new ruler’s distant military 
campaigns strained the social fabric. And in 1524, Huayna Capac 
was stricken by fever. Spanish conquistadors had arrived 
in the Caribbean some time before, bringing diseases to which 
the native peoples had no resistance. Millions died in the outbreak, including Huayna Capac
and his designated heir. The vacant throne ignited a civil war
between two of the surviving brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, greatly weakening the empire. In 1532, after finally winning 
the Inca civil war, Atahualpa and his army 
encountered the European invaders. Although greatly outnumbered, Francisco Pizarro 
and his small group of conquistadors stunned the king’s much larger force 
with guns and horses, neither of which they had seen before. Atahualpa was taken captive 
and killed about a year later. The Spanish conquerors 
were awed by the capital of Cuzco. Pizarro described it as so beautiful that
“it would be remarkable even in Spain.” Though the capital had fallen and the native population had been
destroyed by civil war and disease, some Incas fell back to 
a new capital at Vilcabamba and resisted for the next 40 years. But by 1572, the Spaniards had destroyed 
all remaining resistance along with much of the Incas’ physical 
and cultural legacy. Thus, the great Inca empire fell 
even faster than it had risen.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the question intent and content related to the Incas and their history, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3: Who was the first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas? Options: A. Ayar Manco, B. Manco Capac, C. Pachacuti, D. Viracocha

Although this question does not ask about the year the Incas first settled in Cuzco, it does relate to the early history of the Incas and their rulers. The correct answer, Manco Capac (B), is also mentioned in the transcript as the first Sapa Inca, who founded the capital in the Cuzco Valley.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose, I would say: 
 Question 10, but this does not match at all.

But actually the best answer is: 
There is no match.

**Transcript**:
From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted 
the beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters. The powerful gods usually changed 
their own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations 
were often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation 
befell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter 
of a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth 
the deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning 
the finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands 
flying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly 
from her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew, 
so did her pride. Arachne could often be heard 
boasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed 
anyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving 
as a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it 
as her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom 
and crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne 
making these claims. Planning to teach 
the ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman
and stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim
herself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed, 
barely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off
her cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her 
to a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance 
of the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom 
as a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began, 
eyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured 
wisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass 
from below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes 
that showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry, 
the glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest 
in boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods
abusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer,
transfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned
to the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods 
in the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone 
with her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement 
and lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably
better and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage 
and turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body
shrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly 
as her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair
sprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single 
spool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption
that the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary 
into the first spider. To this day, Arachne and her children spin
out her penance— or is it undaunted persistence?— in the shadows of giants.

**Transcript**:
From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted 
the beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters. The powerful gods usually changed 
their own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations 
were often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation 
befell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter 
of a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth 
the deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning 
the finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands 
flying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly 
from her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew, 
so did her pride. Arachne could often be heard 
boasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed 
anyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving 
as a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it 
as her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom 
and crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne 
making these claims. Planning to teach 
the ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman
and stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim
herself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed, 
barely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off
her cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her 
to a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance 
of the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom 
as a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began, 
eyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured 
wisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass 
from below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes 
that showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry, 
the glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest 
in boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods
abusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer,
transfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned
to the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods 
in the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone 
with her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement 
and lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably
better and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage 
and turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body
shrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly 
as her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair
sprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single 
spool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption
that the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary 
into the first spider. To this day, Arachne and her children spin
out her penance— or is it undaunted persistence?— in the shadows of giants.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are similar. Both questions ask about Athena's motivation for disguising herself as an old woman and approaching Arachne. The correct answer in Question 2 (Option B: To teach Arachne a lesson for her pride and claims of superiority) is also similar to the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ (Option E: See if Arachne was a better weaver than she was and steal Arachne’s talent for herself is not present, but the first part "to teach Arachne a lesson" is a part of the reason Athena disguised herself). 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2.

**Transcript**:
You may take them for granted, 
but your teeth are a marvel. They break up all your food 
over the course of your life, while being strong enough
to withstand breakage themselves. And they’re formed using 
only the raw materials from the food they grind down 
in the first place. What’s behind their impressive strength? Teeth rely on an ingenious structure 
that makes them both hard and tough. Hardness can be thought of as the ability 
to resist a crack from starting, while toughness is what stops 
the crack from spreading Very few materials have both properties. For instance, glass is hard but not tough, while leather is tough but not hard. Teeth manage both by having two layers: a hard external cap of enamel, made up
almost entirely of a calcium phosphate, and beneath it, 
a tougher layer of dentin, partly formed from organic fibers 
that make it flexible. This amazing structure is created 
by two types of cells: ameloblasts that secrete enamel and odontoblasts that secrete dentin. As they form teeth, 
odontoblasts move inward, while ameloblasts move out 
and slough off when they hit the surface. For enamel, this process produces long, 
thin strands, each about 60 nanometers in diameter. That’s one one-thousandth 
the width of a human hair. Those are bundled into rods, 
packed together, tens of thousands per square millimeter, to form the shield-like enamel layer. Once this process is finished, 
your enamel can’t repair itself again because all the cells 
that make it are lost, so we’re lucky that enamel 
can’t be easily destroyed. Odontoblasts use a more complex process,
but unlike ameloblasts, they stick around, continuing to secrete dentin 
throughout your life. Despite the differences in teeth 
across the mammalian order, the underlying process of tooth growth 
is the same whether it’s for lions, kangaroos, elephants, or us. What changes is how nature sculpts 
the shape of the tooth, altering the folding and growth patterns to suit the distinct diets 
of different species. Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel 
ridges for grinding tough grasses. Cats have sharp crested molars, 
like blades, for shearing meat and sinew. Pigs have blunt, thick ones, 
useful for crushing hard roots and seeds. The myriad molars of modern mammals can be traced back to a common form
called “tribosphenic," which first appeared 
during the dinosaur age. In the 19th Century, 
paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope developed the basic model 
for how this form evolved. He hypothesized that 
it started with a cone-like tooth, as we see in many fishes, 
amphibians, and reptiles. Small cusps were then added, 
so the tooth had three in a row, aligned front to back,
and connected by crests. Over time, the cusps were pushed out 
of line to make triangular crowns. Adjacent teeth formed a continuous 
zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing. A low shelf then formed 
at the back of each set of teeth, which became a platform for crushing. As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar 
served as the jumping-off point for the radiation of specialized
forms to follow, each shaped by evolutionary needs. Straighten the crests 
and remove the shelf, and you’ve got the conveniently 
bladed teeth of cats and dogs. Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, 
and you’ve got our human molars. A few additional tweaks get you 
a horse or cow tooth. Some details in Cope’s intuitive
hypothesis proved wrong. But in the fossil record, there are examples of teeth 
that look just as he predicted and we can trace the molars of all living
mammals back to that primitive form. Today, the ability to consume 
diverse forms of food enables mammals to survive in habitats ranging from mountain peaks 
and ocean depths to rainforests and deserts. So the success of our biological class 
is due in no small measure to the remarkable strength 
and adaptability of the humble mammalian molar.

**Transcript**:
You may take them for granted, 
but your teeth are a marvel. They break up all your food 
over the course of your life, while being strong enough
to withstand breakage themselves. And they’re formed using 
only the raw materials from the food they grind down 
in the first place. What’s behind their impressive strength? Teeth rely on an ingenious structure 
that makes them both hard and tough. Hardness can be thought of as the ability 
to resist a crack from starting, while toughness is what stops 
the crack from spreading Very few materials have both properties. For instance, glass is hard but not tough, while leather is tough but not hard. Teeth manage both by having two layers: a hard external cap of enamel, made up
almost entirely of a calcium phosphate, and beneath it, 
a tougher layer of dentin, partly formed from organic fibers 
that make it flexible. This amazing structure is created 
by two types of cells: ameloblasts that secrete enamel and odontoblasts that secrete dentin. As they form teeth, 
odontoblasts move inward, while ameloblasts move out 
and slough off when they hit the surface. For enamel, this process produces long, 
thin strands, each about 60 nanometers in diameter. That’s one one-thousandth 
the width of a human hair. Those are bundled into rods, 
packed together, tens of thousands per square millimeter, to form the shield-like enamel layer. Once this process is finished, 
your enamel can’t repair itself again because all the cells 
that make it are lost, so we’re lucky that enamel 
can’t be easily destroyed. Odontoblasts use a more complex process,
but unlike ameloblasts, they stick around, continuing to secrete dentin 
throughout your life. Despite the differences in teeth 
across the mammalian order, the underlying process of tooth growth 
is the same whether it’s for lions, kangaroos, elephants, or us. What changes is how nature sculpts 
the shape of the tooth, altering the folding and growth patterns to suit the distinct diets 
of different species. Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel 
ridges for grinding tough grasses. Cats have sharp crested molars, 
like blades, for shearing meat and sinew. Pigs have blunt, thick ones, 
useful for crushing hard roots and seeds. The myriad molars of modern mammals can be traced back to a common form
called “tribosphenic," which first appeared 
during the dinosaur age. In the 19th Century, 
paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope developed the basic model 
for how this form evolved. He hypothesized that 
it started with a cone-like tooth, as we see in many fishes, 
amphibians, and reptiles. Small cusps were then added, 
so the tooth had three in a row, aligned front to back,
and connected by crests. Over time, the cusps were pushed out 
of line to make triangular crowns. Adjacent teeth formed a continuous 
zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing. A low shelf then formed 
at the back of each set of teeth, which became a platform for crushing. As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar 
served as the jumping-off point for the radiation of specialized
forms to follow, each shaped by evolutionary needs. Straighten the crests 
and remove the shelf, and you’ve got the conveniently 
bladed teeth of cats and dogs. Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, 
and you’ve got our human molars. A few additional tweaks get you 
a horse or cow tooth. Some details in Cope’s intuitive
hypothesis proved wrong. But in the fossil record, there are examples of teeth 
that look just as he predicted and we can trace the molars of all living
mammals back to that primitive form. Today, the ability to consume 
diverse forms of food enables mammals to survive in habitats ranging from mountain peaks 
and ocean depths to rainforests and deserts. So the success of our biological class 
is due in no small measure to the remarkable strength 
and adaptability of the humble mammalian molar.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the composition of the enamel layer, while Question 5 asks about the diameter of the long, thin strands of enamel. Although not a direct match, Question 5 is related to the structure of enamel and provides information about its composition.

However, a more relevant question that matches the ground truth MCQ's intent would be a generated MCQ that asks about the composition or structure of the enamel layer. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would choose Question 5 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the amazing aspect of mammalian teeth, and the correct option is "all of the above," which includes their strength, adaptability, and ability to enable mammals to survive in diverse habitats.

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the amazing aspect of mammalian teeth. However, Question 2 touches on the concept of hardness and toughness, which is related to the strength of teeth. Question 7 and Question 8 discuss the evolution of molars, which is related to their adaptability. Question 10 talks about the key factor in the success of mammals, which is related to their ability to consume diverse forms of food.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match, as it discusses a key factor in the success of mammals, which is related to the adaptability and strength of their teeth. However, please note that this is a stretch, and none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In a typical hero's journey, the protagonist sets out on an adventure, undergoes great change, and returns in triumph 
to their point of origin. But in the Irish genre of myth
known as Eachtraí, the journey to the other world
ends in a point of no return. While there are many different versions
of the otherworld in Irish mythology, the most well-known example occurs
in the story of Oisín. Oisín was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill,
the leader of a group of pagan warriors known as the Fianna. As Oisín rode with his companions one day, he was visited by 
the immortal princess Niamh. The two fell instantly in love and Niamh put Oisín onto her white horse and rode with him 
to the edge of the Irish sea. As they made for the horizon,
the riders sunk into a golden haze. They came to the shores of
the gleaming kingdom called Tír na nÓg. This was the home of the Tuatha Dé Danann,
the people who ruled Ancient Ireland long before Oisín's time. From the point of his arrival,
Oisín's every need was met. He married Niamh in a grand ceremony
and was welcomed into her family. When he wished to hear music,
his ears filled with bewitching tones. When he hungered, golden plates
appeared laden with fragrant food. He admired scenes of great beauty,
and colors that he had no name for. All around him, the land and the people
existed in a state of unmoving perfection. But what Oisín didn't know was that
Tír na nÓg was the land of youth, in which time stood still
and the people never aged. In his new home, Oisín continued
to hunt and explore as he had in Ireland. But in the land of youth, he possessed
a strange, new invincibility. At the end of each day of adventuring, Oisín's wounds magically healed themselves
as he slept in Niamh's arms. Although glory and pleasure
came easily to Oisín in the land of youth, he missed the Fianna
and the adventures they had in Ireland. After three years in Tír na nÓg, he
was struck by a deep yearning for home. Before he embarked on his journey back,
Niamh warned him that he must not alight from his horse
to touch the earth with his own feet. When Oisín reached the shores of Ireland, it felt as if a shadow 
had fallen over the world. On the hill where his father's palace lay,
he saw only a ruin strewn with weeds. His calls for his friends and family
echoed from derelict walls. Horrified, Oisín rode until he came upon
a group of peasants working in the fields. They were struggling to remove 
a boulder from their land, and forgetting Niamh's warning, Oisín leapt from his horse and rolled it
away with his superhuman strength. The crowd's cheers soon
turned into shrieks. In place of the youth was an old man
whose beard swept the ground and whose legs buckled under him. He cried out for Finn and the Fianna, but the people only recognized these names
from the distant past of 300 years before. Time had betrayed Oisín and his return to mortal lands
had aged him irreversibly. Throughout Irish folklore, sightings of the land of youth
have been reported in the depths of wells, on the brink of the horizon, or in the gloom of caves. But those who know the tale of Oisín
tell of another vision, that of a shining princess carried upon
the distant waves by a white horse, still hoping for the return 
of her doomed love.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the question and options are not identical, the content and intent of Question 5 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Question 5 asks about the uniqueness of the land of Tír na nÓg, and option C states that "It is a land of youth, where time stands still." This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks if Oisín knew that Tír na nÓg was a place of eternal youth. 

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs focus more on recalling events, characters, or facts from the story, whereas the ground truth MCQ requires understanding and inference about Oisín's knowledge of Tír na nÓg. 

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 5, but I would also suggest creating a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
In a typical hero's journey, the protagonist sets out on an adventure, undergoes great change, and returns in triumph 
to their point of origin. But in the Irish genre of myth
known as Eachtraí, the journey to the other world
ends in a point of no return. While there are many different versions
of the otherworld in Irish mythology, the most well-known example occurs
in the story of Oisín. Oisín was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill,
the leader of a group of pagan warriors known as the Fianna. As Oisín rode with his companions one day, he was visited by 
the immortal princess Niamh. The two fell instantly in love and Niamh put Oisín onto her white horse and rode with him 
to the edge of the Irish sea. As they made for the horizon,
the riders sunk into a golden haze. They came to the shores of
the gleaming kingdom called Tír na nÓg. This was the home of the Tuatha Dé Danann,
the people who ruled Ancient Ireland long before Oisín's time. From the point of his arrival,
Oisín's every need was met. He married Niamh in a grand ceremony
and was welcomed into her family. When he wished to hear music,
his ears filled with bewitching tones. When he hungered, golden plates
appeared laden with fragrant food. He admired scenes of great beauty,
and colors that he had no name for. All around him, the land and the people
existed in a state of unmoving perfection. But what Oisín didn't know was that
Tír na nÓg was the land of youth, in which time stood still
and the people never aged. In his new home, Oisín continued
to hunt and explore as he had in Ireland. But in the land of youth, he possessed
a strange, new invincibility. At the end of each day of adventuring, Oisín's wounds magically healed themselves
as he slept in Niamh's arms. Although glory and pleasure
came easily to Oisín in the land of youth, he missed the Fianna
and the adventures they had in Ireland. After three years in Tír na nÓg, he
was struck by a deep yearning for home. Before he embarked on his journey back,
Niamh warned him that he must not alight from his horse
to touch the earth with his own feet. When Oisín reached the shores of Ireland, it felt as if a shadow 
had fallen over the world. On the hill where his father's palace lay,
he saw only a ruin strewn with weeds. His calls for his friends and family
echoed from derelict walls. Horrified, Oisín rode until he came upon
a group of peasants working in the fields. They were struggling to remove 
a boulder from their land, and forgetting Niamh's warning, Oisín leapt from his horse and rolled it
away with his superhuman strength. The crowd's cheers soon
turned into shrieks. In place of the youth was an old man
whose beard swept the ground and whose legs buckled under him. He cried out for Finn and the Fianna, but the people only recognized these names
from the distant past of 300 years before. Time had betrayed Oisín and his return to mortal lands
had aged him irreversibly. Throughout Irish folklore, sightings of the land of youth
have been reported in the depths of wells, on the brink of the horizon, or in the gloom of caves. But those who know the tale of Oisín
tell of another vision, that of a shining princess carried upon
the distant waves by a white horse, still hoping for the return 
of her doomed love.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQs are Question 6 and Question 9.

Question 6 asks why Oisín decides to leave Tír na nÓg, and one of the options (B) mentions that he misses his friends and family in Ireland, which is related to the fact that he lived in Tír na nÓg for three years.

Question 9 asks how much time has passed in Ireland since Oisín left for Tír na nÓg, and one of the options (C) mentions 300 years, which is related to the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ (D. Both three years and three hundred years).

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the time aspect of Oisín's stay in Tír na nÓg, which is the main focus of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It was the perfect wedding, 
the guests thought. The groom was Orpheus,
the greatest of all poets and musicians. The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph. Anyone could tell the couple 
was truly and deeply in love. Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled, 
then fell to the ground. By the time Orpheus reached her side,
she was dead, and the snake that had bitten 
her was slithering away through the grass. Following Eurydice’s funeral, Orpheus was overcome with a grief 
the human world could not contain, and so he decided he would journey 
to the land of the dead, a place from which no living creature 
had ever returned, to rescue his beloved. When Orpheus reached the gates of the
underworld, he began to strum his lyre. The music was so beautiful that Cerberus,
the three-headed dog who guards the dead, lay down as Orpheus passed. Charon, the ferry captain who charged 
dead souls to cross the River Styx, was so moved by the music that he brought 
Orpheus across free of charge. When Orpheus entered 
the palace of Hades and Persephone, the king and queen of the dead, he began to sing. He sang of his love for Eurydice, 
and said she had been taken away too soon. The day would come when she, 
like all living creatures, dwelled in the land of the
dead for all eternity, so couldn’t Hades grant 
her just a few more years on Earth? In the moment after Orpheus finished, 
all hell stood still. Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock
up the hill. Tantalus did not reach for the water 
he would never be allowed to drink. Even the Furies, 
the demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept. Hades and Persephone granted
Orpheus’s plea, but on one condition. As he climbed back out of the underworld, he must not turn around to see 
if Eurydice was following behind him. If he did, she would return
to the land of the dead forever. Orpheus began to climb. With each step, he worried more and more 
about whether Eurydice was behind him. He heard nothing—
where were her footsteps? Finally, just before he stepped out 
of the underworld and into the bright light of day, he gave into temptation. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld,
but was refused entry. Separated from Eurydice, Orpheus swore never
to love another woman again. Instead, he sat in a grove of trees 
and sang songs of lovers. There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy 
who Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods. There was Myrrah, who loved her father 
and was punished for it, and Pygmalion, who sculpted 
his ideal woman out of ivory, then prayed to Venus 
until she came to life. And there was Venus herself, whose beautiful Adonis 
was killed by a wild boar. It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss had allowed him to see into 
the hearts of gods and people everywhere. For some, however, poetry was not enough. A group of wild women called the Maenads could not bear the thought that a poet 
who sang so beautifully of love would not love them. Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy 
and they destroyed poor Orpheus. The birds, nature’s singers, 
mourned Orpheus, as did the rivers, 
who made music as they babbled. The world had lost two great souls. Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other 
so deeply that when they were separated, Orpheus had understood 
the pain and joys of lovers everywhere, and a new art form, 
the love poem, was born. While the world wept, Orpheus found peace,
and his other half, in the underworld. There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice
along the banks of the River Styx. Sometimes, they stroll side by side; sometimes, she is in front; and sometimes, he takes the lead, turning 
to look back at her as often as he likes.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that Question 6 is the closest match.

Question 6 asks about how Orpheus coped with the loss of Eurydice, and one of the options (B) mentions that he sang songs of lovers and shared their stories. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the lovers that Orpheus sings about.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not explicitly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

Index: 6 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
It was the perfect wedding, 
the guests thought. The groom was Orpheus,
the greatest of all poets and musicians. The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph. Anyone could tell the couple 
was truly and deeply in love. Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled, 
then fell to the ground. By the time Orpheus reached her side,
she was dead, and the snake that had bitten 
her was slithering away through the grass. Following Eurydice’s funeral, Orpheus was overcome with a grief 
the human world could not contain, and so he decided he would journey 
to the land of the dead, a place from which no living creature 
had ever returned, to rescue his beloved. When Orpheus reached the gates of the
underworld, he began to strum his lyre. The music was so beautiful that Cerberus,
the three-headed dog who guards the dead, lay down as Orpheus passed. Charon, the ferry captain who charged 
dead souls to cross the River Styx, was so moved by the music that he brought 
Orpheus across free of charge. When Orpheus entered 
the palace of Hades and Persephone, the king and queen of the dead, he began to sing. He sang of his love for Eurydice, 
and said she had been taken away too soon. The day would come when she, 
like all living creatures, dwelled in the land of the
dead for all eternity, so couldn’t Hades grant 
her just a few more years on Earth? In the moment after Orpheus finished, 
all hell stood still. Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock
up the hill. Tantalus did not reach for the water 
he would never be allowed to drink. Even the Furies, 
the demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept. Hades and Persephone granted
Orpheus’s plea, but on one condition. As he climbed back out of the underworld, he must not turn around to see 
if Eurydice was following behind him. If he did, she would return
to the land of the dead forever. Orpheus began to climb. With each step, he worried more and more 
about whether Eurydice was behind him. He heard nothing—
where were her footsteps? Finally, just before he stepped out 
of the underworld and into the bright light of day, he gave into temptation. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld,
but was refused entry. Separated from Eurydice, Orpheus swore never
to love another woman again. Instead, he sat in a grove of trees 
and sang songs of lovers. There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy 
who Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods. There was Myrrah, who loved her father 
and was punished for it, and Pygmalion, who sculpted 
his ideal woman out of ivory, then prayed to Venus 
until she came to life. And there was Venus herself, whose beautiful Adonis 
was killed by a wild boar. It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss had allowed him to see into 
the hearts of gods and people everywhere. For some, however, poetry was not enough. A group of wild women called the Maenads could not bear the thought that a poet 
who sang so beautifully of love would not love them. Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy 
and they destroyed poor Orpheus. The birds, nature’s singers, 
mourned Orpheus, as did the rivers, 
who made music as they babbled. The world had lost two great souls. Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other 
so deeply that when they were separated, Orpheus had understood 
the pain and joys of lovers everywhere, and a new art form, 
the love poem, was born. While the world wept, Orpheus found peace,
and his other half, in the underworld. There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice
along the banks of the River Styx. Sometimes, they stroll side by side; sometimes, she is in front; and sometimes, he takes the lead, turning 
to look back at her as often as he likes.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A mosquito lands on your arm, injects its chemicals into your skin, 
and begins to feed. You wouldn’t even know it was there,
if not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by a telltale itch. It’s a nuisance, but that bump 
is an important signal that you’re protected 
by your immune system, your body’s major safeguard 
against infection, illness, and disease. This system is a vast network of cells, 
tissues, and organs that coordinate your body’s defenses 
against any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to billions 
of bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor
as a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal. The immune system relies on millions 
of defensive white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, that originate in our bone marrow. These cells migrate into the bloodstream
and the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps 
clear bodily toxins and waste. Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 
and 11,000 in every microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes 
work like security personnel, constantly screening the blood, 
tissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system mainly relies 
on cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface 
of pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s 
protective immune response to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response 
has to be equally adaptable. That means relying on many 
different types of leukocytes to tackle threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify 
leukocytes in two main cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger 
the immune response by sending macrophages 
and dendritic cells into the blood. As these circulate, they destroy
any foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders 
they just ingested and transmit this information 
to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense, the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells
go in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information gathered 
from the unique antigens to start producing special proteins 
called antibodies. This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching 
antibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce millions of these, which then cycle through the body 
and attack the invaders until the worst of the
threat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, 
familiar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed 
to aid the immune response. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria
and viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid
leak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts phagocytes, which consume the invaders
and the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response 
will eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill,
but that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous 
levels inside your body. And through constant 
surveillance over time, the immune system 
provides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells identify antigens, they can use that information 
to recognize invaders in the future. So, when a threat revisits, the cells
can swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it before it affects 
any more cells. That’s how you can develop immunity 
to certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system into attacking the body’s own 
perfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes them, but these disorders sabotage 
the immune system to varying degrees, and underlie problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals, however, a healthy immune system will successfully
fight off an estimated 300 colds and innumerable other potential infections
over the course of a lifetime. Without it, those threats would escalate 
into something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a cold 
or scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our lives.

**Transcript**:
A mosquito lands on your arm, injects its chemicals into your skin, 
and begins to feed. You wouldn’t even know it was there,
if not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by a telltale itch. It’s a nuisance, but that bump 
is an important signal that you’re protected 
by your immune system, your body’s major safeguard 
against infection, illness, and disease. This system is a vast network of cells, 
tissues, and organs that coordinate your body’s defenses 
against any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to billions 
of bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor
as a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal. The immune system relies on millions 
of defensive white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, that originate in our bone marrow. These cells migrate into the bloodstream
and the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps 
clear bodily toxins and waste. Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 
and 11,000 in every microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes 
work like security personnel, constantly screening the blood, 
tissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system mainly relies 
on cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface 
of pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s 
protective immune response to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response 
has to be equally adaptable. That means relying on many 
different types of leukocytes to tackle threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify 
leukocytes in two main cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger 
the immune response by sending macrophages 
and dendritic cells into the blood. As these circulate, they destroy
any foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders 
they just ingested and transmit this information 
to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense, the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells
go in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information gathered 
from the unique antigens to start producing special proteins 
called antibodies. This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching 
antibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce millions of these, which then cycle through the body 
and attack the invaders until the worst of the
threat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, 
familiar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed 
to aid the immune response. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria
and viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid
leak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts phagocytes, which consume the invaders
and the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response 
will eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill,
but that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous 
levels inside your body. And through constant 
surveillance over time, the immune system 
provides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells identify antigens, they can use that information 
to recognize invaders in the future. So, when a threat revisits, the cells
can swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it before it affects 
any more cells. That’s how you can develop immunity 
to certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system into attacking the body’s own 
perfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes them, but these disorders sabotage 
the immune system to varying degrees, and underlie problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals, however, a healthy immune system will successfully
fight off an estimated 300 colds and innumerable other potential infections
over the course of a lifetime. Without it, those threats would escalate 
into something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a cold 
or scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our lives.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the system that carries leukocytes around the body. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 2 asks about the origin of leukocytes, and in its explanation in the transcript, the bloodstream and lymphatic system are mentioned as the networks where leukocytes migrate.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly involves the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Since this is not available, I will choose the most relevant generated MCQ based on the transcript.

Generated MCQ index: None (However, if I had to choose, I would say Question 2 is the most relevant, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ's intent.)

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The starving orphan seeking 
a second helping of gruel. The spinster wasting away 
in her tattered wedding dress. The stone-hearted miser plagued 
by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures
from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work 
that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's
writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, 
plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept
his audience wanting more. When first published, 
his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters
at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books. This prompted fevered speculation
over the cliffhangers and revelations he devised. Serialization not only made fiction
available to a wider audience and kept them reading, but increased the hype
around the author himself. Dickens became particularly popular
for his wit, which he poured into quirky characters
and satiric scenarios. His characters exhibit the sheer
absurdity of human behavior, and their names often personify
traits or social positions, like the downtrodden Bob Cratchit, the groveling Uriah Heep, and the cheery Septimus Crisparkle. Dickens set these colorful characters
against intricate social backdrops, which mimic the society he lived in. For instance, he often considered the changes brought about 
by the Industrial Revolution. During this period, the lower classes experienced 
sordid working and living conditions. Dickens himself experienced 
this hardship as a child when he was forced to work in
a boot blacking factory after his father was sent 
to debtors' prison. This influenced his depiction
of the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit, where the titular character cares
for her convict father. Prisons, orphanages, or slums
may seem grim settings for a story, but they allowed Dickens to shed light on how his society's 
most invisible people lived. In Nicholas Nickleby, Nicholas takes a job with the schoolmaster
Wackford Squeers. He soon realizes that Squeers
is running a scam where he takes unwanted children
from their parents for a fee and subjects them to violence
and deprivation. Oliver Twist also deals with the plight 
of children in the care of the state, illustrating the brutal conditions of
the workhouse in which Oliver pleads
with Mr. Bumble for food. When he flees to London, he becomes
ensnared in a criminal underworld. These stories frequently portray
Victorian life as grimy, corrupt, and cruel. But Dickens also saw his time
as one in which old traditions were fading away. London was becoming
the incubator of the modern world through new patterns in industry,
trade, and social mobility. Dickens's London is therefore
a dualistic space: a harsh world that is simultaneously
filled with wonder and possibility. For instance, the enigma 
of Great Expectations centers around the potential of Pip, an orphan plucked from obscurity
by an anonymous benefactor and propelled into high society. In his search for purpose, Pip becomes the victim 
of other people’s ambitions for him and must negotiate with 
a shadowy cast of characters. Like many of Dickens’s protagonists, poor Pip's position 
is constantly destabilized, just one of the reasons 
why reading Dickens is the best of times for the reader, while being the worst of times 
for his characters. Dickens typically offered clear 
resolution by the end of his novels, – with the exception of
The Mystery of Edwin Drood. The novel details the disappearance of the
orphan Edwin under puzzling circumstances. However, Dickens died before the novel 
was finished and left no notes resolving the mystery. Readers continue to passionately debate 
over who Dickens intended as the murderer, and whether Edwin Drood 
was even murdered in the first place. Throughout many adaptations, literary homages, and the pages of his novels, Dickens’s sparkling language
and panoramic worldview continue to resonate. Today, the adjective Dickensian often implies squalid working 
or living conditions. But to describe a novel as
Dickensian is typically high praise, as it suggests a story in which true 
adventure and discovery occur in the most unexpected places. Although he often explored bleak material, Dickens’s piercing wit never failed
to find light in the darkest corners.

**Transcript**:
The starving orphan seeking 
a second helping of gruel. The spinster wasting away 
in her tattered wedding dress. The stone-hearted miser plagued 
by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures
from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work 
that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's
writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, 
plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept
his audience wanting more. When first published, 
his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters
at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books. This prompted fevered speculation
over the cliffhangers and revelations he devised. Serialization not only made fiction
available to a wider audience and kept them reading, but increased the hype
around the author himself. Dickens became particularly popular
for his wit, which he poured into quirky characters
and satiric scenarios. His characters exhibit the sheer
absurdity of human behavior, and their names often personify
traits or social positions, like the downtrodden Bob Cratchit, the groveling Uriah Heep, and the cheery Septimus Crisparkle. Dickens set these colorful characters
against intricate social backdrops, which mimic the society he lived in. For instance, he often considered the changes brought about 
by the Industrial Revolution. During this period, the lower classes experienced 
sordid working and living conditions. Dickens himself experienced 
this hardship as a child when he was forced to work in
a boot blacking factory after his father was sent 
to debtors' prison. This influenced his depiction
of the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit, where the titular character cares
for her convict father. Prisons, orphanages, or slums
may seem grim settings for a story, but they allowed Dickens to shed light on how his society's 
most invisible people lived. In Nicholas Nickleby, Nicholas takes a job with the schoolmaster
Wackford Squeers. He soon realizes that Squeers
is running a scam where he takes unwanted children
from their parents for a fee and subjects them to violence
and deprivation. Oliver Twist also deals with the plight 
of children in the care of the state, illustrating the brutal conditions of
the workhouse in which Oliver pleads
with Mr. Bumble for food. When he flees to London, he becomes
ensnared in a criminal underworld. These stories frequently portray
Victorian life as grimy, corrupt, and cruel. But Dickens also saw his time
as one in which old traditions were fading away. London was becoming
the incubator of the modern world through new patterns in industry,
trade, and social mobility. Dickens's London is therefore
a dualistic space: a harsh world that is simultaneously
filled with wonder and possibility. For instance, the enigma 
of Great Expectations centers around the potential of Pip, an orphan plucked from obscurity
by an anonymous benefactor and propelled into high society. In his search for purpose, Pip becomes the victim 
of other people’s ambitions for him and must negotiate with 
a shadowy cast of characters. Like many of Dickens’s protagonists, poor Pip's position 
is constantly destabilized, just one of the reasons 
why reading Dickens is the best of times for the reader, while being the worst of times 
for his characters. Dickens typically offered clear 
resolution by the end of his novels, – with the exception of
The Mystery of Edwin Drood. The novel details the disappearance of the
orphan Edwin under puzzling circumstances. However, Dickens died before the novel 
was finished and left no notes resolving the mystery. Readers continue to passionately debate 
over who Dickens intended as the murderer, and whether Edwin Drood 
was even murdered in the first place. Throughout many adaptations, literary homages, and the pages of his novels, Dickens’s sparkling language
and panoramic worldview continue to resonate. Today, the adjective Dickensian often implies squalid working 
or living conditions. But to describe a novel as
Dickensian is typically high praise, as it suggests a story in which true 
adventure and discovery occur in the most unexpected places. Although he often explored bleak material, Dickens’s piercing wit never failed
to find light in the darkest corners.

**Transcript**:
In 1800, the explorer 
Alexander von Humboldt witnessed a swarm of electric eels
leap out of the water to defend themselves 
against oncoming horses. Most people thought the story
so unusual that Humboldt made it up. But fish using electricity is more common
than you might think; and yes, electric eels are a type of fish. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways
to communicate, navigate, and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey. Nearly 350 species of fish
have specialized anatomical structures that generate 
and detect electrical signals. These fish are divided into two groups, depending on how much 
electricity they produce. Scientists call the first group
the weakly electric fish. Structures near their tails 
called electric organs produce up to a volt of electricity,
about two-thirds as much as a AA battery. How does this work? The fish's brain sends a signal through
its nervous system to the electric organ, which is filled with stacks of hundreds or thousands of disc-shaped 
cells called electrocytes. Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium
and potassium ions to maintain a positive charge outside
and negative charge inside. But when the nerve signal arrives
at the electrocyte, it prompts the ion gates to open. Positively charged ions flow back in. Now, one face of the electrocyte
is negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. But the far side 
has the opposite charge pattern. These alternating charges 
can drive a current, turning the electrocyte 
into a biological battery. The key to these fish's powers 
is that nerve signals are coordinated to arrive at each cell 
at exactly the same time. That makes the stacks of electrocytes
act like thousands of batteries in series. The tiny charges from each one
add up to an electrical field that can travel several meters. Cells called electroreceptors
buried in the skin allow the fish to constantly sense
this field and the changes to it caused 
by the surroundings or other fish. The Peter’s elephantnose fish, 
for example, has an elongated chin
called a schnauzenorgan that's riddled in electroreceptors. That allows it to intercept signals
from other fish, judge distances, detect the shape and size
of nearby objects, and even determine whether
a buried insect is dead or alive. But the elephantnose
and other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity
to attack their prey. That ability belongs 
to the strongly electric fish, of which there are only 
a handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric
fish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span
almost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals
to navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest 
electric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out
and then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two 
or three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles,
sending it into spasms and generating waves 
that reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast, 
high-voltage discharges causes even more intense 
muscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up
so that the electric fields generated at each end 
of the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually
exhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel 
can swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish
are the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ 
that occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped
electric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world
of electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size 
of strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out 
of their bodies too quickly. Some scientists think that special 
proteins may shield the electric organs, but the truth is, this is one mystery 
science still hasn't illuminated.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the anatomy of electric eels, I would say that Question 8 is the closest: "Which species of fish is the most powerful strongly electric fish?" Options: A. Electric catfish, B. Electric ray, C. Electric eel, D. Peter's elephantnose fish.

But again, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the number of electric organs in electric eels.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but a related one is Question 8 (Index 8).

**Transcript**:
In 1800, the explorer 
Alexander von Humboldt witnessed a swarm of electric eels
leap out of the water to defend themselves 
against oncoming horses. Most people thought the story
so unusual that Humboldt made it up. But fish using electricity is more common
than you might think; and yes, electric eels are a type of fish. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways
to communicate, navigate, and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey. Nearly 350 species of fish
have specialized anatomical structures that generate 
and detect electrical signals. These fish are divided into two groups, depending on how much 
electricity they produce. Scientists call the first group
the weakly electric fish. Structures near their tails 
called electric organs produce up to a volt of electricity,
about two-thirds as much as a AA battery. How does this work? The fish's brain sends a signal through
its nervous system to the electric organ, which is filled with stacks of hundreds or thousands of disc-shaped 
cells called electrocytes. Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium
and potassium ions to maintain a positive charge outside
and negative charge inside. But when the nerve signal arrives
at the electrocyte, it prompts the ion gates to open. Positively charged ions flow back in. Now, one face of the electrocyte
is negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. But the far side 
has the opposite charge pattern. These alternating charges 
can drive a current, turning the electrocyte 
into a biological battery. The key to these fish's powers 
is that nerve signals are coordinated to arrive at each cell 
at exactly the same time. That makes the stacks of electrocytes
act like thousands of batteries in series. The tiny charges from each one
add up to an electrical field that can travel several meters. Cells called electroreceptors
buried in the skin allow the fish to constantly sense
this field and the changes to it caused 
by the surroundings or other fish. The Peter’s elephantnose fish, 
for example, has an elongated chin
called a schnauzenorgan that's riddled in electroreceptors. That allows it to intercept signals
from other fish, judge distances, detect the shape and size
of nearby objects, and even determine whether
a buried insect is dead or alive. But the elephantnose
and other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity
to attack their prey. That ability belongs 
to the strongly electric fish, of which there are only 
a handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric
fish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span
almost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals
to navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest 
electric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out
and then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two 
or three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles,
sending it into spasms and generating waves 
that reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast, 
high-voltage discharges causes even more intense 
muscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up
so that the electric fields generated at each end 
of the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually
exhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel 
can swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish
are the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ 
that occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped
electric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world
of electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size 
of strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out 
of their bodies too quickly. Some scientists think that special 
proteins may shield the electric organs, but the truth is, this is one mystery 
science still hasn't illuminated.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3. 

Here's why:

- The ground truth MCQ asks about the capabilities of weakly electric fish, specifically what they cannot do.
- Question 3 asks about the primary function of the electric organs in weakly electric fish, which is related to their capabilities.
- Although the question intents are not identical, they both focus on the characteristics of weakly electric fish.
- The correct option for the ground truth MCQ (D. Immobilizing their prey) is not present in Question 3, but the description of the primary function of electric organs in weakly electric fish (Option B) implies that they do not produce high-voltage discharges for hunting, which is related to immobilizing prey.

While there isn't a perfect match, Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and question intent.

If a stranger needed help how long would it take you to offer them a hand? According to psychology the answer to that question may depend less on who you are as a person and more on how many people are with you at the time. In a strange paradox of human nature the more people there are in a group, the less likely anyone is to offer help. It's called the bystander effect, and it may be a roadblock that's keeping you from showing empathy When someone is in need people in large groups tend to feel that they don't need to do anything because someone else will take care of it. This is known as the diffusion of responsibility The end result is nobody does anything, and if you don't believe me I'll show you we started with a large group of 10 people and told them they were here today to see a product demonstration. So we're just basically looking for emotional reactions to certain products. We're not quite ready to go yet. So as you can see you have these surveys go ahead start filling them out take all the time you need with them. I am gonna go get the product and just Kinda start throwing it together, and then we're gonna begin sound good everyone? okay cool. Thanks Here's the thing though, everybody but one of these people wasn't in on it We gave her a 10-minute window where she could offer to help. Let's see if she comes to my rescue We repeated this a few more times with varying results. Next we tried it with a group of five. Oh geez So far it's not looking good for people in general Are we just plain unhelpful? Or is there something to the bystander effect. To find out let's see how helpful people are when they're all by themselves Hi The results with our group of 10 people: it took our participants an average of 8 minutes and 1 second before they lent a hand Can I help? I just feel bad Participants in our groups of 5 were a little quicker saving me from the tent with an average time of 7 minutes and 25 seconds Uh. Do you need help? Do you want to give me a hand? Yeah. That'd be great thank you. What can I do? But when our participants were by themselves that is when they really shined Thank you so much. On average They offered to step in in just 3 minutes and 19 seconds. You were the fastest by a country mile I have set this thing up by myself 7 times today completely you took a total of 12 seconds why why do you think you're so quick to do it? I like to help in any way that I can. that's the funny thing about the bystander effect You would think that a group with more people would mean there's a higher chance someone would do something But people in a group are actually less likely to help I knew I should have just stood up and done it But then a big part of you wanted to see what these people would do and I was just kind of like our than any Of them gonna help. At first I was a little shy to jump it in help, but then after I just you know I'm just gonna jump in and help. Thank you I appreciate it. You're welcome All right, took 8 minutes. When it's just the two of us in this space. There's like a bond that's created It's like I'm not gonna let you struggle on your own, and I think if there is a group of people It's way more acceptable for me to be doing that. it's the diffusion of responsibility I think that's totally true. if something is saying jump in and offer the help Just follow that intuition even though no one else is saying anything just hey if you can be a part of helping someone Instead of just watching the struggle or even take out your cell phone. You're like tape it or something like that which is the worst?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the options of Question 6 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will consider other questions.

Question 2 and Question 6 are related to the bystander effect, but they do not directly address the factors that influence how fast someone responds to a stranger in need.

Considering the options and the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but it would need to be modified to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **6**

However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the factors that influence how fast someone responds to a stranger in need, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, a new MCQ should be generated to directly match the ground truth MCQ. 

Here is an example of a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: According to the transcript, how fast you respond to a stranger in need depends on 
Options: A. who you are as a person, B. what they need help with, C. how many people you are with at the time, D. both a and c, E. all of the above
Correct Option: D

**Transcript**:
For some, it's a serious sport. For others, just a way to let loose. But despite its casual association
with fun and sun, surfing has a richer and deeper
history than many realize. What we today call surfing originated in the Polynesian islands 
of the Pacific Ocean. We know from various accounts that wave riding was done 
throughout the Polynesian Pacific, as well as in West Africa and Peru. But it was in the Hawaiian archipelago
in particular that surfing advanced the most, was best documented, and, unlike elsewhere in Polynesia,
persisted. And for the people of Hawaii, wave sliding was not 
just a recreational activity, but one with spiritual 
and social significance. Like much of Hawaiian society, nearly every aspect of surfing was
governed by a code of rules and taboos known as kapu. Hawaiians made offerings when selecting
a tree to carve, prayed for waves with the help
of a kahuna, or an expert priest, and gave thanks after surviving
a perilous wipeout. Certain surf breaks were strickly reserved
for the elite. But it wasn't just a solemn affair. Surfers competed and wagered
on who could ride the farthest, the fastest, or catch the biggest wave
with superior skill, granting respect, social status, and romantic success. Though it was later called
the sport of kings, Hawaiian men and women of all ages
and social classes participated, riding surfboards shaped from koa, breadfruit, or wiliwili trees. Many Hawaiians road alaia boards, which were thin, midsized,
and somewhat resemble today's shortboards. Some mounted paipo boards, short, round-nosed boards on which
riders typically lay on their stomachs. But only chieftains could ride
the massive olo boards, twice as long as today's longboards. Unlike most modern surfboards, all boards were finless, requiring surfers to drag their hands
or feet to turn. We don't know exactly when wave sliding
was invented, but we know that it had already
been practiced in Polynesia for centuries by the time it was described in 1777
by William Anderson, a surgeon on Captain Cook's ship
"Resolution." Although Anderson was in awe, most of the American Christian 
missionaries who arrived in Hawaii several decades later regarded surfing as sinful, and they discouraged it, along with
other aspects of native culture. The biggest threat to surfing, however,
was the threat to the natives themselves. By 1890, new illnesses introduced
by Europeans and Americans had decimated the Hawaiian people,
leaving fewer than 40,000 from a pre-contact population 
that may have exceeded 800,000. At the same time, foreign influence grew with white settlers overthrowing 
the native monarchy in 1893, and the U.S. annexing 
the islands five years later. The end of Hawaii's independence coincided
with surfing's native-led revival, a revival soon exploited
by the American colonizers. But first, some Hawaiians 
took surfing overseas. In 1907, George Freeth,
the so-called Hawaiian Wonder, traveled to the west coast and gave surfing demonstrations 
in southern California. Then in 1914, Olympic swimmer
Duke Kahanamoku made his way to Australia and New Zealand, gliding across the southern Pacific waves and attracting rapt audiences 
wherever he went. Shortly before Freeth went to California, a South Carolinian named 
Alexander Hume Ford moved to Hawaii. After learning to surf, he became 
a champion of the pastime. But Ford may have had unsavory reasons for his enthusiastic efforts 
to boost the sport. Like many settlers, he wanted Hawaii
to become a U.S. state but was worried about its non-white
majority of natives and Asian workers. Ford thus promoted surfing
to attract white Americans to Hawaii, first as tourists, then as residents. He was helped by numerous writers
and filmmakers. Ford's demographic plan 
would fail miserably. Hawaii became a state in 1959 and remains the most racially diverse 
state in the country. But the promotion of surfing
was a far greater success. Today, surfing is a multi-billion dollar
global industry, with tens of millions 
of enthusiasts worldwide. And though relatively few of these surfers
are aware of the once-crucial wave chants or board carving rituals, Hawaiians continue to preserve
these traditions nearly washed away by history's waves.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 7: Who is known for giving surfing demonstrations in southern California in 1907? Options: A. Duke Kahanamoku, B. George Freeth, C. Alexander Hume Ford, D. William Anderson

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it refers to a different event and location. A more similar question would be one that mentions Duke Kahanamoku and his trip to Australia and New Zealand in 1914.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, although it's not a perfect match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 7 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match).

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQs. In this case, a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ would be:

Question: Duke Kahanamoku helped to spread surf culture after making his way to _____________ in 1914.
Options: A. Europe, B. South Africa, C. South America, D. Australia and New Zealand

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, but it would be the perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For some, it's a serious sport. For others, just a way to let loose. But despite its casual association
with fun and sun, surfing has a richer and deeper
history than many realize. What we today call surfing originated in the Polynesian islands 
of the Pacific Ocean. We know from various accounts that wave riding was done 
throughout the Polynesian Pacific, as well as in West Africa and Peru. But it was in the Hawaiian archipelago
in particular that surfing advanced the most, was best documented, and, unlike elsewhere in Polynesia,
persisted. And for the people of Hawaii, wave sliding was not 
just a recreational activity, but one with spiritual 
and social significance. Like much of Hawaiian society, nearly every aspect of surfing was
governed by a code of rules and taboos known as kapu. Hawaiians made offerings when selecting
a tree to carve, prayed for waves with the help
of a kahuna, or an expert priest, and gave thanks after surviving
a perilous wipeout. Certain surf breaks were strickly reserved
for the elite. But it wasn't just a solemn affair. Surfers competed and wagered
on who could ride the farthest, the fastest, or catch the biggest wave
with superior skill, granting respect, social status, and romantic success. Though it was later called
the sport of kings, Hawaiian men and women of all ages
and social classes participated, riding surfboards shaped from koa, breadfruit, or wiliwili trees. Many Hawaiians road alaia boards, which were thin, midsized,
and somewhat resemble today's shortboards. Some mounted paipo boards, short, round-nosed boards on which
riders typically lay on their stomachs. But only chieftains could ride
the massive olo boards, twice as long as today's longboards. Unlike most modern surfboards, all boards were finless, requiring surfers to drag their hands
or feet to turn. We don't know exactly when wave sliding
was invented, but we know that it had already
been practiced in Polynesia for centuries by the time it was described in 1777
by William Anderson, a surgeon on Captain Cook's ship
"Resolution." Although Anderson was in awe, most of the American Christian 
missionaries who arrived in Hawaii several decades later regarded surfing as sinful, and they discouraged it, along with
other aspects of native culture. The biggest threat to surfing, however,
was the threat to the natives themselves. By 1890, new illnesses introduced
by Europeans and Americans had decimated the Hawaiian people,
leaving fewer than 40,000 from a pre-contact population 
that may have exceeded 800,000. At the same time, foreign influence grew with white settlers overthrowing 
the native monarchy in 1893, and the U.S. annexing 
the islands five years later. The end of Hawaii's independence coincided
with surfing's native-led revival, a revival soon exploited
by the American colonizers. But first, some Hawaiians 
took surfing overseas. In 1907, George Freeth,
the so-called Hawaiian Wonder, traveled to the west coast and gave surfing demonstrations 
in southern California. Then in 1914, Olympic swimmer
Duke Kahanamoku made his way to Australia and New Zealand, gliding across the southern Pacific waves and attracting rapt audiences 
wherever he went. Shortly before Freeth went to California, a South Carolinian named 
Alexander Hume Ford moved to Hawaii. After learning to surf, he became 
a champion of the pastime. But Ford may have had unsavory reasons for his enthusiastic efforts 
to boost the sport. Like many settlers, he wanted Hawaii
to become a U.S. state but was worried about its non-white
majority of natives and Asian workers. Ford thus promoted surfing
to attract white Americans to Hawaii, first as tourists, then as residents. He was helped by numerous writers
and filmmakers. Ford's demographic plan 
would fail miserably. Hawaii became a state in 1959 and remains the most racially diverse 
state in the country. But the promotion of surfing
was a far greater success. Today, surfing is a multi-billion dollar
global industry, with tens of millions 
of enthusiasts worldwide. And though relatively few of these surfers
are aware of the once-crucial wave chants or board carving rituals, Hawaiians continue to preserve
these traditions nearly washed away by history's waves.

**Transcript**:
Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against 
a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or
driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,
whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus
to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating 
all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts
of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability 
to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped
the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed 
they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants 
of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient
creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude
creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide
how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick
that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it
into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed 
the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones
under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly
best portion for himself, he was outraged 
at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use
of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat 
or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see
his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus
to steal fire from the workshop 
of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk
and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness
nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care 
for themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons
and wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst
for the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,
he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again
wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained
to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture
who would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back
to be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained 
in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret 
at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression
made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous
and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,
and power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure
in art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's
lyrical drama "Prometheus Unbound," the author imagines Prometheus
as a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread
empathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, "Prometheus is the type 
of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest 
and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends." His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus
as a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel
"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus." This suggests the damage of corrupting
the natural order and remains relevant 
to the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our
capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimately, he reminds us of the potential 
of individual acts to ignite the world.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Zeus' intention for humans, while Question 2 asks about the task entrusted to Prometheus and Epimetheus by Zeus, which includes creating humans. Although the options do not directly match, the context and intent of the questions are related.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about Zeus' intentions for humans, with similar options.

**Transcript**:
Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against 
a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or
driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,
whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus
to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating 
all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts
of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability 
to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped
the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed 
they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants 
of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient
creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude
creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide
how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick
that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it
into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed 
the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones
under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly
best portion for himself, he was outraged 
at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use
of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat 
or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see
his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus
to steal fire from the workshop 
of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk
and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness
nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care 
for themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons
and wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst
for the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,
he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again
wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained
to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture
who would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back
to be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained 
in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret 
at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression
made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous
and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,
and power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure
in art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's
lyrical drama "Prometheus Unbound," the author imagines Prometheus
as a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread
empathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, "Prometheus is the type 
of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest 
and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends." His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus
as a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel
"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus." This suggests the damage of corrupting
the natural order and remains relevant 
to the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our
capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimately, he reminds us of the potential 
of individual acts to ignite the world.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What gift did Prometheus steal from the gods to give to humans? Options: A. The gift of flight, B. The gift of immortality, C. The gift of fire, D. The gift of wisdom.

However, the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the motivation behind Prometheus's actions. A more suitable match would be a question that combines the elements of Prometheus's actions (stealing fire) with his motivations (to defy Zeus and help humans).

Because it was a sacred gift reserved for the gods, C. Because Prometheus deceived him with a trick, D. Because it was a threat to the natural order, is related to the ground truth MCQ but still does not exactly match its intent.

**Transcript**:
There's a play so powerful 
that an old superstition says its name should never 
even be uttered in a theater, a play that begins with witchcraft
and ends with a bloody severed head, a play filled with riddles, prophesies,
nightmare visions, and lots of brutal murder, a play by William Shakespeare sometimes
referred to as the "Scottish Play" or the "Tragedy of Macbeth." First performed at the Globe Theater
in London in 1606, "Macbeth" is 
Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. It is also one of his most action-packed. In five acts, he recounts a story
of a Scottish nobleman who steals the throne, presides over a reign of terror, and then meets a bloody end. Along the way, it asks important questions
about ambition, power, and violence that spoke directly to the politics
of Shakespeare's time and continue to echo in our own. England in the early 17th century 
was politically precarious. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603
without producing an heir, and in a surprise move, her advisors passed the crown
to James Stewart, King of Scotland. Two years later, James was subject
to an assassination attempt called the Gunpowder Plot. Questions of what made 
for a legitimate king were on everyone's lips. So Shakespeare must have known
he had potent material when he conflated and adapted the stories of a murderous 11th century 
Scottish King named Macbeth and those of several 
other Scottish nobles. He found their annals
in Hollinshed's "Chronicles," a popular 16th century history
of Britain and Ireland. Shakespeare would also have known
he needed to tell his story in a way that would 
immediately grab the attention of his diverse and rowdy audience. The Globe welcomed 
all sections of society. Wealthier patrons watched the stage
from covered balconies while poorer people paid a penny
to take in the show from an open-air section called the pit. Talking, jeering, and cheering
was common during performances. There are even accounts of audiences
throwing furniture when plays were flops. So "Macbeth" opens with a literal bang. Thunder cracks and three witches appear. They announce they're searching for a Scottish nobleman 
and war hero named Macbeth, then fly off while chanting a curse
that predicts a world gone mad. "Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air." As seen later, they find Macbeth
and his fellow nobleman Banquo. "All hail Macbeth," they prophesize,
"that shalt be king hereafter!" "King?" Macbeth wonders. Just what would he have to do 
to gain the crown? Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth soon chart a course of murder, 
lies, and betrayal. In the ensuing bloodbath, Shakespeare provides viewers with some
of the most memorable passages in English literature. "Out, damned spot! Out, I say!"
Lady Macbeth cries when she believes she can't wipe her victim's blood 
off her hands. Her obsession with guilt is one
of many themes that runs through the play, along with the universal tendency
to abuse power, the endless cycles of violence 
and betrayal, the defying political conflict. As is typical with Shakespeare's language, a number of phrases 
that got their start in the play have been repeated so many times
that they now feel commonplace. They include "the milk of human kindness," "what's done is done," and the famous witches' spell, "Double, double toil and trouble; 
Fire burn, and caldron bubble." But Shakespeare saves the juiciest
bit of all for Macbeth himself. Towards the end of the play,
Macbeth reflects on the universality of death and the futility of life. "Out, out, brief candle!" he laments. "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts 
and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, 
full of sound and fury signifying nothing." Life may be a tale told my an idiot,
but "Macbeth" is not. Shakespeare's language and characters
have entered our cultural consciousness to a rare extent. Directors often use the story
to shed light on abuses of power, ranging from the American mafia to dictators across the globe. The play has been adapted 
to film many times, including Akira Kurosawa's 
"Throne of Blood," which takes place in feudal Japan, and a modernized version 
called "Scotland, PA," in which Macbeth and his rivals are managers of competing 
fast food restaurants. No matter the presentation, questions of morality, politics, and power are still relevant today, and so, it seems, 
is Shakespeare's "Macbeth."

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that Question 5 is the closest match.

Question 5: How did the witches' curse in "Macbeth" predict the future? Options: A. A world at peace, B. A world gone mad, C. A world in chaos, D. A world in darkness

Although this question does not directly ask about Macbeth's ambition, it does mention the witches' curse, which is the event that triggers Macbeth's ambition in the play. However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely align with the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
There's a play so powerful 
that an old superstition says its name should never 
even be uttered in a theater, a play that begins with witchcraft
and ends with a bloody severed head, a play filled with riddles, prophesies,
nightmare visions, and lots of brutal murder, a play by William Shakespeare sometimes
referred to as the "Scottish Play" or the "Tragedy of Macbeth." First performed at the Globe Theater
in London in 1606, "Macbeth" is 
Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. It is also one of his most action-packed. In five acts, he recounts a story
of a Scottish nobleman who steals the throne, presides over a reign of terror, and then meets a bloody end. Along the way, it asks important questions
about ambition, power, and violence that spoke directly to the politics
of Shakespeare's time and continue to echo in our own. England in the early 17th century 
was politically precarious. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603
without producing an heir, and in a surprise move, her advisors passed the crown
to James Stewart, King of Scotland. Two years later, James was subject
to an assassination attempt called the Gunpowder Plot. Questions of what made 
for a legitimate king were on everyone's lips. So Shakespeare must have known
he had potent material when he conflated and adapted the stories of a murderous 11th century 
Scottish King named Macbeth and those of several 
other Scottish nobles. He found their annals
in Hollinshed's "Chronicles," a popular 16th century history
of Britain and Ireland. Shakespeare would also have known
he needed to tell his story in a way that would 
immediately grab the attention of his diverse and rowdy audience. The Globe welcomed 
all sections of society. Wealthier patrons watched the stage
from covered balconies while poorer people paid a penny
to take in the show from an open-air section called the pit. Talking, jeering, and cheering
was common during performances. There are even accounts of audiences
throwing furniture when plays were flops. So "Macbeth" opens with a literal bang. Thunder cracks and three witches appear. They announce they're searching for a Scottish nobleman 
and war hero named Macbeth, then fly off while chanting a curse
that predicts a world gone mad. "Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air." As seen later, they find Macbeth
and his fellow nobleman Banquo. "All hail Macbeth," they prophesize,
"that shalt be king hereafter!" "King?" Macbeth wonders. Just what would he have to do 
to gain the crown? Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth soon chart a course of murder, 
lies, and betrayal. In the ensuing bloodbath, Shakespeare provides viewers with some
of the most memorable passages in English literature. "Out, damned spot! Out, I say!"
Lady Macbeth cries when she believes she can't wipe her victim's blood 
off her hands. Her obsession with guilt is one
of many themes that runs through the play, along with the universal tendency
to abuse power, the endless cycles of violence 
and betrayal, the defying political conflict. As is typical with Shakespeare's language, a number of phrases 
that got their start in the play have been repeated so many times
that they now feel commonplace. They include "the milk of human kindness," "what's done is done," and the famous witches' spell, "Double, double toil and trouble; 
Fire burn, and caldron bubble." But Shakespeare saves the juiciest
bit of all for Macbeth himself. Towards the end of the play,
Macbeth reflects on the universality of death and the futility of life. "Out, out, brief candle!" he laments. "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts 
and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, 
full of sound and fury signifying nothing." Life may be a tale told my an idiot,
but "Macbeth" is not. Shakespeare's language and characters
have entered our cultural consciousness to a rare extent. Directors often use the story
to shed light on abuses of power, ranging from the American mafia to dictators across the globe. The play has been adapted 
to film many times, including Akira Kurosawa's 
"Throne of Blood," which takes place in feudal Japan, and a modernized version 
called "Scotland, PA," in which Macbeth and his rivals are managers of competing 
fast food restaurants. No matter the presentation, questions of morality, politics, and power are still relevant today, and so, it seems, 
is Shakespeare's "Macbeth."

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, the mathematician
Robert Recorde wrote a book called 
"The Whetstone of Witte" to teach English students algebra. But he was getting tired of writing
the words "is equal to" over and over. His solution? He replaced those words with
two parallel horizontal line segments because the way he saw it,
no two things can be more equal. Could he have used four line segments
instead of two? Of course. Could he have used vertical line segments? In fact, some people did. There's no reason why the equals sign
had to look the way it does today. At some point, it just caught on,
sort of like a meme. More and more mathematicians
began to use it, and eventually, 
it became a standard symbol for equality. Math is full of symbols. Lines, dots, arrows, English letters, Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts. It can look like an illegible jumble. It's normal to find this wealth
of symbols a little intimidating and to wonder where they all came from. Sometimes, as Recorde himself
noted about his equals sign, there's an apt conformity
between the symbol and what it represents. Another example of that 
is the plus sign for addition, which originated from a condensing
of the Latin word et meaning and. Sometimes, however, the choice of symbol
is more arbitrary, such as when a mathematician
named Christian Kramp introduced the exclamation mark
for factorials just because he needed a shorthand
for expressions like this. In fact, all of these symbols 
were invented or adopted by mathematicians who wanted
to avoid repeating themselves or having to use a lot of words
to write out mathematical ideas. Many of the symbols used
in mathematics are letters, usually from the Latin alphabet
or Greek. Characters are often found
representing quantities that are unknown, and the relationships between variables. They also stand in for specific numbers
that show up frequently but would be cumbersome or impossible
to fully write out in decimal form. Sets of numbers and whole equations
can be represented with letters, too. Other symbols are used 
to represent operations. Some of these are especially valuable
as shorthand because they condense repeated operations
into a single expression. The repeated addition of the same number
is abbreviated with a multiplication sign so it doesn't take up more space
than it has to. A number multiplied by itself
is indicated with an exponent that tells you how many times
to repeat the operation. And a long string of sequential terms
added together is collapsed into a capital sigma. These symbols shorten
lengthy calculations to smaller terms that are much easier to manipulate. Symbols can also provide 
succinct instructions about how to perform calculations. Consider the following set
of operations on a number. Take some number that you're thinking of, multiply it by two, subtract one from the result, multiply the result of that by itself, divide the result of that by three, and then add one to get the final output. Without our symbols and conventions,
we'd be faced with this block of text. With them, we have a compact,
elegant expression. Sometimes, as with equals, these symbols communicate meaning
through form. Many, however, are arbitrary. Understanding them is a matter
of memorizing what they mean and applying them in different contexts
until they stick, as with any language. If we were to encounter
an alien civilization, they'd probably have a totally
different set of symbols. But if they think anything like us,
they'd probably have symbols. And their symbols may even correspond
directly to ours. They'd have their own multiplication sign, symbol for pi, and, of course, equals.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: Who introduced the exclamation mark for factorials? However, the options do not include Robert Recorde as the correct answer for the equals sign. But among the generated questions, Question 4 is about the introduction of a mathematical symbol by a specific mathematician, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ. It is not present among the options, but if we were to rephrase Question 2 to "Who introduced the two parallel horizontal line segments to represent equality?", then it would be the most similar. But that is not the case here.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be something like: "The mathematician who first introduced our modern ‘equals’ sign was:" which is not present among the options.

However, if we were to choose from the existing options, then the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 4.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, the mathematician
Robert Recorde wrote a book called 
"The Whetstone of Witte" to teach English students algebra. But he was getting tired of writing
the words "is equal to" over and over. His solution? He replaced those words with
two parallel horizontal line segments because the way he saw it,
no two things can be more equal. Could he have used four line segments
instead of two? Of course. Could he have used vertical line segments? In fact, some people did. There's no reason why the equals sign
had to look the way it does today. At some point, it just caught on,
sort of like a meme. More and more mathematicians
began to use it, and eventually, 
it became a standard symbol for equality. Math is full of symbols. Lines, dots, arrows, English letters, Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts. It can look like an illegible jumble. It's normal to find this wealth
of symbols a little intimidating and to wonder where they all came from. Sometimes, as Recorde himself
noted about his equals sign, there's an apt conformity
between the symbol and what it represents. Another example of that 
is the plus sign for addition, which originated from a condensing
of the Latin word et meaning and. Sometimes, however, the choice of symbol
is more arbitrary, such as when a mathematician
named Christian Kramp introduced the exclamation mark
for factorials just because he needed a shorthand
for expressions like this. In fact, all of these symbols 
were invented or adopted by mathematicians who wanted
to avoid repeating themselves or having to use a lot of words
to write out mathematical ideas. Many of the symbols used
in mathematics are letters, usually from the Latin alphabet
or Greek. Characters are often found
representing quantities that are unknown, and the relationships between variables. They also stand in for specific numbers
that show up frequently but would be cumbersome or impossible
to fully write out in decimal form. Sets of numbers and whole equations
can be represented with letters, too. Other symbols are used 
to represent operations. Some of these are especially valuable
as shorthand because they condense repeated operations
into a single expression. The repeated addition of the same number
is abbreviated with a multiplication sign so it doesn't take up more space
than it has to. A number multiplied by itself
is indicated with an exponent that tells you how many times
to repeat the operation. And a long string of sequential terms
added together is collapsed into a capital sigma. These symbols shorten
lengthy calculations to smaller terms that are much easier to manipulate. Symbols can also provide 
succinct instructions about how to perform calculations. Consider the following set
of operations on a number. Take some number that you're thinking of, multiply it by two, subtract one from the result, multiply the result of that by itself, divide the result of that by three, and then add one to get the final output. Without our symbols and conventions,
we'd be faced with this block of text. With them, we have a compact,
elegant expression. Sometimes, as with equals, these symbols communicate meaning
through form. Many, however, are arbitrary. Understanding them is a matter
of memorizing what they mean and applying them in different contexts
until they stick, as with any language. If we were to encounter
an alien civilization, they'd probably have a totally
different set of symbols. But if they think anything like us,
they'd probably have symbols. And their symbols may even correspond
directly to ours. They'd have their own multiplication sign, symbol for pi, and, of course, equals.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the transcript and the ground truth MCQ, the most similar generated MCQ would be:

Question 9: What is the benefit of using symbols and conventions in mathematics? Options: A. It makes calculations more difficult, B. It makes calculations more time-consuming, C. It provides succinct instructions about how to perform calculations, D. It makes mathematics more abstract

However, this question does not directly address the meaning of mathematical symbols being suggested by the symbol itself or being arbitrary.

A more relevant question that could match the ground truth MCQ is not present among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one that could be related to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

Question 2: Why did Robert Recorde use two parallel horizontal line segments to represent equality? Options: A. Because it was a common symbol in mathematics at the time, B. Because he wanted a unique symbol that would stand out, C. Because no two things can be more equal, D. Because it was a random choice

This question touches on the idea that the equals sign has a meaning suggested by the symbol itself (i.e., two parallel lines representing equality). However, it does not address the arbitrary nature of mathematical symbols.

Given the options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 2, with the understanding that it only partially addresses the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin are widely accepted, The debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture. Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently? Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs. Humans have been genetically modifing plants and animals for thousands of years. Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields. Maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal. So you did the smart thing, and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you. Traits suggest an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced. After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a so called "Genetically Modified Organism", or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want. Make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So, why are people concerned about them ? Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs. Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention, but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this, however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use. This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted, and traces of modified genes found in foreign crops. But GM plants can't run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves, and all crops have to be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones, to keep unintentional crossing at a minimum. But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally cross with a non-GMO, there's actually a more important question. Is food that comes from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible dangers, and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent. But don't just take it our word for it, the sources for this and other claims are in the video description. But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis, lets engineered plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide. Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming! Pesticide sprays could be washed off. While the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it's not a big deal. Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What's harmless to one species, might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us. Or take chocolate, it's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans. BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of certain insects; it's completely harmless for us. There's also the opposite approach. Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely, killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop. Here, we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business. Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means famers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside. That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and a business practice of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid, it's also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model. GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not a enemy in that fight, helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment. Let's look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often, whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides. Not only was this very expensive, Farmers also frequently got sick. The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them. This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improved, and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes, the GM approach is the only option. In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed. All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides, or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. The scientists are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients, like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional vitamins. On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants more resilient to climate change, plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions, making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air, like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its build-up pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once. The over use of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super-effective carbon collectors,  like the American chestnut tree, to mitigate and actually reverse climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit. The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now, with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only drastically change agriculture but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior. GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere. This video took more than 600 hours to make, which would be impossible without viewer support on Patreon.com.

**Transcript**:
It was the dawn of 1863, and London’s 
not-yet-opened subway system, the first of its kind in the world, 
had the city in an uproar. Digging a hole under the city 
and putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway
company of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than
100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground 
to travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction
and a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway 
was ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible 
congestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest 
and most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary, 
Charles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways 
under the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains 
throughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea
was impractical since the railroads at the time 
only had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway 
through the center of a city? The answer was a simple system 
called "cut and cover." Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole 
over the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition 
of buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went
under existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm 
flooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as 
the Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in 
to ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became 
a vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened 
next to the railroad, and the railway company 
even created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls
Court to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered 
80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town
running in tunnels, and suburban trains operating 
on the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted 
to be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with
buildings, sewers, and electric cables for the "cut and cover" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine 
called the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could 
bore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels 
through the London clay. These new lines, called tubes,
were at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than 
the "cut and cover" lines. This meant their construction 
didn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible 
to dig under buildings. The first tube line, 
the City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines 
were built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used 
to burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities 
in 55 countries using underground rails 
to combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson
and the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track.

**Transcript**:
It was the dawn of 1863, and London’s 
not-yet-opened subway system, the first of its kind in the world, 
had the city in an uproar. Digging a hole under the city 
and putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway
company of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than
100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground 
to travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction
and a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway 
was ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible 
congestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest 
and most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary, 
Charles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways 
under the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains 
throughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea
was impractical since the railroads at the time 
only had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway 
through the center of a city? The answer was a simple system 
called "cut and cover." Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole 
over the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition 
of buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went
under existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm 
flooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as 
the Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in 
to ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became 
a vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened 
next to the railroad, and the railway company 
even created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls
Court to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered 
80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town
running in tunnels, and suburban trains operating 
on the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted 
to be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with
buildings, sewers, and electric cables for the "cut and cover" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine 
called the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could 
bore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels 
through the London clay. These new lines, called tubes,
were at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than 
the "cut and cover" lines. This meant their construction 
didn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible 
to dig under buildings. The first tube line, 
the City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines 
were built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used 
to burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities 
in 55 countries using underground rails 
to combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson
and the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track.

**Transcript**:
Once, a long time ago, there was a powerful hermit 
named Lok Ta Moni Eysei. He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest: whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply
wringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, 
and loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso 
collected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball 
unlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous 
and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess
so they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances 
and flew off, Ream Eyso resolved 
to take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air 
in search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun 
and attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would
never allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand 
in the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun 
against the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search
until he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she 
and her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students 
and rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear, 
refused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away
from her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through
nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, 
Mekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand 
but the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began 
to swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon,
Mekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes 
of lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose 
in wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air 
it cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds 
of water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, 
now blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what
she should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness 
and love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion 
and flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his 
strength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued 
to dance across the earth. Some drops fell on Vorachhun
and revived him, his skin golden like 
a rice field ready for harvest. Grabbing his magic dagger, he flew into the sky in search 
of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala.

Once, a long time ago, there was a powerful hermit 
named Lok Ta Moni Eysei. He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest: whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply

**Transcript**:
Once, a long time ago, there was a powerful hermit 
named Lok Ta Moni Eysei. He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, 
the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely
manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose 
heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift 
upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,
he announced a contest: whoever first brought back 
a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun 
and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf 
or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking 
the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently 
with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply
wringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, 
and loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso 
collected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball 
unlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous 
and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess
so they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances 
and flew off, Ream Eyso resolved 
to take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air 
in search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun 
and attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would
never allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand 
in the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun 
against the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search
until he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she 
and her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students 
and rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear, 
refused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away
from her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through
nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, 
Mekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand 
but the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began 
to swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon,
Mekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes 
of lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose 
in wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air 
it cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds 
of water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, 
now blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what
she should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness 
and love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion 
and flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his 
strength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued 
to dance across the earth. Some drops fell on Vorachhun
and revived him, his skin golden like 
a rice field ready for harvest. Grabbing his magic dagger, he flew into the sky in search 
of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala.

**Transcript**:
Most history books will tell you the Roman
Empire fell in the fifth century CE. But this would’ve come as a great surprise
to the millions of people who lived in the Roman Empire up
through the Middle Ages. This medieval Roman Empire, which we usually refer 
to today as the Byzantine Empire, began in 330 CE. That’s when Constantine,
the first Christian emperor, moved the capital of the Roman Empire 
to a new city called Constantinople, which he founded on the site of the
ancient Greek city Byzantion. When the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 and the Empire’s western provinces 
were conquered by barbarians, Constantine’s Eastern capital remained 
the seat of the Roman emperors. There, generations of emperors ruled 
for the next 11 centuries. Sharing continuity with 
the classical Roman Empire gave the Byzantine empire a technological
and artistic advantage over its neighbors, whom Byzantines considered barbarians. In the ninth century, 
visitors from beyond the frontier were astonished 
at the graceful stone arches and domes of the imperial palace in Constantinople. A pair of golden lions flanked 
the imperial throne. A hidden organ would make the lions 
roar as guests fell on their knees. Golden birds
sung from a nearby golden tree. Medieval Roman engineers 
even used hydraulic engines to raise the imperial throne 
high into the air. Other inherited aspects 
of ancient Roman culture could be seen in emperors’ clothing, from traditional military garb to togas, and in the courts, which continued to use Roman law. Working-class Byzantines would’ve also 
had similar lives to their Ancient Roman counterparts; many farmed or plied a specific trade, such as ceramics, leatherworking, fishing, weaving, or manufacturing silk. But, of course, the Byzantine Empire didn’t just rest 
on the laurels of Ancient Rome. Their artists innovated, creating vast 
mosaics and ornate marble carvings. Their architects constructed
numerous churches, one of which, called Hagia Sophia, had a dome so high it was said to be
hanging on a chain from heaven. The Empire was also home to great
intellectuals such as Anna Komnene. As imperial princess in the 12th century, Anna dedicated her life 
to philosophy and history. Her account of her father’s reign
is historians’ foremost source for Byzantine political history 
at the time of the first crusade. Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician, invented a system of beacons that ran the
width of the empire— what’s now Greece and Turkey. Stretching more than 700 kilometers, this system allowed the edge of the Empire
to warn the emperor of invading armies within one hour
of sighting them at the border. But their advances couldn’t 
protect the Empire forever. In 1203, an army of French 
and Venetian Crusaders made a deal with a man 
named Alexios Angelos. Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor, and promised the crusaders vast riches and support to help him retake 
the throne from his uncle. Alexios succeeded, but after a year, the population rebelled and Alexios 
himself was deposed and killed. So Alexios’s unpaid army turned 
their aggression on Constantinople. They lit massive fires, which destroyed countless works of ancient
and medieval art and literature, leaving about one-third 
of the population homeless. The city was reclaimed 50 years later 
by the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos, but his restored Empire never regained
all the territory the Crusaders had conquered. Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed
the Conqueror captured Constantinople, bringing a conclusive end 
to the Roman Empire. Despite the Ottoman conquest, many Greek-speaking inhabitants 
of the Eastern Mediterranean continued to call themselves Romans 
until the early 21st century. In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the term “Byzantine Empire” 
was first used. For Western Europeans, the Renaissance was about 
reconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity. And since the existence of a
medieval Roman Empire suggested there were Europeans 
who’d never lost touch with antiquity, Western Europeans wanted to draw 
clear lines between the ages. To better distinguish the classical, 
Latin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire from the medieval, 
Greek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire, scholars renamed 
the latter group Byzantines. And thus, 100 years after it had
fallen, the Byzantine Empire was born.

on the laurels of Ancient Rome. Their artists innovated, creating vast 
mosaics and ornate marble carvings. Their architects constructed
numerous churches, one of which, called Hagia Sophia, had a dome so high it was said to be
hanging on a chain from heaven. The Empire was also home to great
intellectuals such as Anna Komnene. As imperial princess in the 12th century, Anna dedicated her life 
to philosophy and history. Her account of her father’s reign
is historians’ foremost source for Byzantine political history 
at the time of the first crusade. Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician, invented a system of beacons that ran the
width of the empire— what’s now Greece and Turkey. Stretching more than 700 kilometers, this system allowed the edge of the Empire
to warn the emperor of invading armies within one hour
of sighting them at the border. But their advances couldn’t 
protect the Empire forever. In 1203, an army of French 
and Venetian Crusaders made a deal with a man 
named Alexios Angelos. Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor, and promised the crusaders vast riches and support to help him retake 
the throne from his uncle. Alexios succeeded, but after a year, the population rebelled and Alexios 
himself was deposed and killed. So Alexios’s unpaid army turned 
their aggression on Constantinople. They lit massive fires, which destroyed countless works of ancient
and medieval art and literature, leaving about one-third 
of the population homeless. The city was reclaimed 50 years later 
by the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos, but his restored Empire never regained
all the territory the Crusaders had conquered. Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed
the Conqueror captured Constantinople, bringing a conclusive end 
to the Roman Empire. Despite the Ottoman conquest, many Greek-speaking inhabitants 
of the Eastern Mediterranean continued to call themselves Romans 
until the early 21st century. In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the term “Byzantine Empire” 
was first used. For Western Europeans, the Renaissance was about 
reconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity. And since the existence of a
medieval Roman Empire suggested there were Europeans 
who’d never lost touch with antiquity, Western Europeans wanted to draw 
clear lines between the ages. To better distinguish the classical, 
Latin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire from the medieval, 
Greek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire, scholars renamed 
the latter group Byzantines. And thus, 100 years after it had
fallen, the Byzantine Empire was born.

Most history books will tell you the Roman
Empire fell in the fifth century CE. But this would’ve come as a great surprise
to the millions of people who lived in the Roman Empire up
through the Middle Ages. This medieval Roman Empire, which we usually refer 
to today as the Byzantine Empire, began in 330 CE. That’s when Constantine,
the first Christian emperor, moved the capital of the Roman Empire 
to a new city called Constantinople, which he founded on the site of the
ancient Greek city Byzantion. When the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 and the Empire’s western provinces 
were conquered by barbarians, Constantine’s Eastern capital remained 
the seat of the Roman emperors. There, generations of emperors ruled 
for the next 11 centuries. Sharing continuity with 
the classical Roman Empire gave the Byzantine empire a technological
and artistic advantage over its neighbors, whom Byzantines considered barbarians. In the ninth century, 
visitors from beyond the frontier were astonished 
at the graceful stone arches and domes of the imperial palace in Constantinople. A pair of golden lions flanked 
the imperial throne. A hidden organ would make the lions 
roar as guests fell on their knees. Golden birds
sung from a nearby golden tree. Medieval Roman engineers 
even used hydraulic engines to raise the imperial throne 
high into the air. Other inherited aspects 
of ancient Roman culture could be seen in emperors’ clothing, from traditional military garb to togas, and in the courts, which continued to use Roman law. Working-class Byzantines would’ve also

**Transcript**:
A pungent blend of onions, cheese,
and cat urine with hints of... is that…wet goat? Most of us don’t need more than one whiff to identify that generally unpleasant, 
characteristic smell we call body odor. But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon influenced by our genetic makeup, 
age, diet, and hygiene. So what is this odor, exactly? Where does it come from? And can we do anything about it? To start, you just need two things 
to produce that familiar scent: your armpit’s own secretions and the bacteria that feed on them. Most people associate 
body odor with sweat, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle. Your body has millions of sweat glands, 
and they come in two major types: eccrine glands are found 
all over your skin and secrete mainly water and salt. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, 
develop at puberty in your armpits and a few other places on your body. The sweat they secrete 
is full of proteins and fats. By themselves, 
these secretions are usually odorless. That’s where bacteria come in. Every square centimeter of our bodies 
is covered with thousands of bacteria. Many microorganisms thrive 
in moist environments, like our armpits. There, you can find about a million 
bacteria per square centimeter, one of the highest concentrations 
anywhere on the skin. Lurking in this throng of microorganisms 
are species of Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, Micrococci, and others. When these bacteria feed on the proteins 
and fats in apocrine sweat, they turn the odorless compounds into
new ones that can smell very unpleasant. Some of the worst offenders may be 
sulfur-containing chemicals; those give body odor its oniony aroma. Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, 
adding notes of cheese. These molecules waft up from the armpit 
and can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations 
of less than one in a million. So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit, and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with. Your genes help determine 
what compounds you produce, and in what quantity, so everyone has a slightly different set. In fact, a gene variant that virtually 
eliminates body odor is common in people of East Asian descent. Adrenaline increases the ratio 
of apocrine to eccrine sweat, so body odor can be more intense
when you’re nervous. Bacterial composition and concentration 
also varies between individuals and plays a part. Even what you eat can have 
a small effect on how you smell. So how can we deal with body odor? Washing the armpits with soap and water 
helps but won’t remove all the bacteria since many are buried 
in deeper layers of the skin. Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial 
activity and mask odors at the same time. Antiperspirants work by forming tiny
gel plugs that block sweat glands, drying out the armpits. While we continue to battle body odor, 
scientists are trying to understand it. We don’t know why the brain often interprets these particular 
odors as off-putting. But some researchers have proposed 
that secretions from the armpit could have a positive function, too, like cementing social bonds and providing a means 
of chemical communication. We don’t know yet if that’s the case. For now, body odor seems to be just another smelly part 
of the human condition.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Body odor production requires ______.
Options: A. Eccrine secretion, B. Apocrine secretion, C. Bacteria, D. All of the above

Question: What is the primary role of bacteria in the production of body odor?

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A pungent blend of onions, cheese,
and cat urine with hints of... is that…wet goat? Most of us don’t need more than one whiff to identify that generally unpleasant, 
characteristic smell we call body odor. But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon influenced by our genetic makeup, 
age, diet, and hygiene. So what is this odor, exactly? Where does it come from? And can we do anything about it? To start, you just need two things 
to produce that familiar scent: your armpit’s own secretions and the bacteria that feed on them. Most people associate 
body odor with sweat, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle. Your body has millions of sweat glands, 
and they come in two major types: eccrine glands are found 
all over your skin and secrete mainly water and salt. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, 
develop at puberty in your armpits and a few other places on your body. The sweat they secrete 
is full of proteins and fats. By themselves, 
these secretions are usually odorless. That’s where bacteria come in. Every square centimeter of our bodies 
is covered with thousands of bacteria. Many microorganisms thrive 
in moist environments, like our armpits. There, you can find about a million 
bacteria per square centimeter, one of the highest concentrations 
anywhere on the skin. Lurking in this throng of microorganisms 
are species of Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, Micrococci, and others. When these bacteria feed on the proteins 
and fats in apocrine sweat, they turn the odorless compounds into
new ones that can smell very unpleasant. Some of the worst offenders may be 
sulfur-containing chemicals; those give body odor its oniony aroma. Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, 
adding notes of cheese. These molecules waft up from the armpit 
and can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations 
of less than one in a million. So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit, and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with. Your genes help determine 
what compounds you produce, and in what quantity, so everyone has a slightly different set. In fact, a gene variant that virtually 
eliminates body odor is common in people of East Asian descent. Adrenaline increases the ratio 
of apocrine to eccrine sweat, so body odor can be more intense
when you’re nervous. Bacterial composition and concentration 
also varies between individuals and plays a part. Even what you eat can have 
a small effect on how you smell. So how can we deal with body odor? Washing the armpits with soap and water 
helps but won’t remove all the bacteria since many are buried 
in deeper layers of the skin. Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial 
activity and mask odors at the same time. Antiperspirants work by forming tiny
gel plugs that block sweat glands, drying out the armpits. While we continue to battle body odor, 
scientists are trying to understand it. We don’t know why the brain often interprets these particular 
odors as off-putting. But some researchers have proposed 
that secretions from the armpit could have a positive function, too, like cementing social bonds and providing a means 
of chemical communication. We don’t know yet if that’s the case. For now, body odor seems to be just another smelly part 
of the human condition.

and can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations 
of less than one in a million. So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit, and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with. Your genes help determine 
what compounds you produce, and in what quantity, so everyone has a slightly different set. In fact, a gene variant that virtually 
eliminates body odor is common in people of East Asian descent. Adrenaline increases the ratio 
of apocrine to eccrine sweat, so body odor can be more intense
when you’re nervous. Bacterial composition and concentration 
also varies between individuals and plays a part. Even what you eat can have 
a small effect on how you smell. So how can we deal with body odor? Washing the armpits with soap and water 
helps but won’t remove all the bacteria since many are buried 
in deeper layers of the skin. Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial 
activity and mask odors at the same time. Antiperspirants work by forming tiny
gel plugs that block sweat glands, drying out the armpits. While we continue to battle body odor, 
scientists are trying to understand it. We don’t know why the brain often interprets these particular 
odors as off-putting. But some researchers have proposed 
that secretions from the armpit could have a positive function, too, like cementing social bonds and providing a means 
of chemical communication. We don’t know yet if that’s the case. For now, body odor seems to be just another smelly part 
of the human condition.

**Transcript**:
A pungent blend of onions, cheese,
and cat urine with hints of... is that…wet goat? Most of us don’t need more than one whiff to identify that generally unpleasant, 
characteristic smell we call body odor. But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon influenced by our genetic makeup, 
age, diet, and hygiene. So what is this odor, exactly? Where does it come from? And can we do anything about it? To start, you just need two things 
to produce that familiar scent: your armpit’s own secretions and the bacteria that feed on them. Most people associate 
body odor with sweat, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle. Your body has millions of sweat glands, 
and they come in two major types: eccrine glands are found 
all over your skin and secrete mainly water and salt. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, 
develop at puberty in your armpits and a few other places on your body. The sweat they secrete 
is full of proteins and fats. By themselves, 
these secretions are usually odorless. That’s where bacteria come in. Every square centimeter of our bodies 
is covered with thousands of bacteria. Many microorganisms thrive 
in moist environments, like our armpits. There, you can find about a million 
bacteria per square centimeter, one of the highest concentrations 
anywhere on the skin. Lurking in this throng of microorganisms 
are species of Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, Micrococci, and others. When these bacteria feed on the proteins 
and fats in apocrine sweat, they turn the odorless compounds into
new ones that can smell very unpleasant. Some of the worst offenders may be 
sulfur-containing chemicals; those give body odor its oniony aroma. Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, 
adding notes of cheese. These molecules waft up from the armpit 
and can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected 
by an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations 
of less than one in a million. So what determines how strong 
your body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial
populations in your armpit, and the nutrients that 
your glands provide them with. Your genes help determine

**Transcript**:
It’s 427 BCE and the worst internal 
conflict ever to occur in the ancient Greek world 
is in its fourth year. The Peloponnesian War is being fought between the city-states of Athens and
Sparta, as well as their allies. The Athenians can’t match the formidable 
Spartan army on land. So they’ve abandoned the countryside and moved inside the walls surrounding 
their city and port, now provisioned by a superior fleet 
and extensive maritime empire. The cramped conditions have taken a toll and a recent plague wiped out 
a third of the population. But city life goes on. Archias and Dexileia live 
in the center of Athens. As a painter of high-class pottery, Archias is relatively well-off and takes 
great interest in the city’s affairs. Dexileia, on the other hand, can't
participate in politics or own property. The couple are grateful to the gods that 
three of their four children, a son and two daughters, have survived past infancy. Many parents see daughters as a liability since they require dowries 
to find husbands. But Archias is confident that his wealth will allow him to make good matches
for them without going bankrupt. Like many Athenians, 
the family owns slaves. Originally from Thrace,
they were captured in war. Thratta does most of the housework 
and helps raise the children. Philon is a paidagôgos, who supervises the son’s education, 
teaching him reading and writing. Archias is up early because there’s 
a meeting of the Ekklêsia, the assembly of citizens, taking place at dawn. Before setting out, he burns incense and pours a libation at the small shrine 
in the courtyard on behalf of his entire household. Dexileia will remain at home all day, 
teaching her daughters domestic skills. Later, she’ll retire to the inner 
courtyard for some fresh air. When Archias arrives at the agora, the civic and commercial heart 
of the city, he finds the square swarming 
with his fellow citizens, native-born adult males who 
have completed military training. Attached to the central monument is 
a noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda. Today, there’s only one item 
of discussion: what to do with the people of Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos where a revolt against Athenian rule 
has just been put down. The meeting takes place on a hill west 
of the acropolis known as the Pnyx. The word means “tightly packed," and the crowd of 5,000 citizens 
makes it clear why. The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling 
its boundary with pig’s blood and call for order. As everyone sits on benches 
facing the platform, the presiding officer opens the meeting 
with the words: “Tis agoreuein bouleutai?” “Who wishes to address the assembly?” One by one, citizens speak, some advising 
mercy, others bent on vengeance. A motion is proposed to execute 
all the Mytileneans and enslave their women and children because they betrayed their Athenian 
allies during a time of war. A majority raises their right hands 
in favor. Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads 
back to the agora to buy food and wine. Hundreds have gathered there 
to discuss the results, many unhappy with the decision. When Archias returns home, 
he tells Dexileia about the debate. She thinks that killing the innocent 
as well as the guilty is harsh and counterproductive, and tells him as much. Around dusk, Archias goes to 
a friend’s house for a symposium. The nine men drink wine and
discuss the meeting well into the night. Archias shares his wife’s opinion urging 
mercy, and his friends eventually agree. Before dawn, something 
unprecedented happens. Heralds circulate throughout Athens announcing the council 
has called another meeting. The second debate is equally heated, but a new resolution, 
to execute only the leaders of the revolt, narrowly passes. Yet there’s a problem – a ship with orders to carry out 
the first resolution was dispatched the previous day. And so another ship quickly sets sail 
to countermand the order – a race of democracy against time.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s 427 BCE and the worst internal 
conflict ever to occur in the ancient Greek world 
is in its fourth year. The Peloponnesian War is being fought between the city-states of Athens and
Sparta, as well as their allies. The Athenians can’t match the formidable 
Spartan army on land. So they’ve abandoned the countryside and moved inside the walls surrounding 
their city and port, now provisioned by a superior fleet 
and extensive maritime empire. The cramped conditions have taken a toll and a recent plague wiped out 
a third of the population. But city life goes on. Archias and Dexileia live 
in the center of Athens. As a painter of high-class pottery, Archias is relatively well-off and takes 
great interest in the city’s affairs. Dexileia, on the other hand, can't
participate in politics or own property. The couple are grateful to the gods that 
three of their four children, a son and two daughters, have survived past infancy. Many parents see daughters as a liability since they require dowries 
to find husbands. But Archias is confident that his wealth will allow him to make good matches
for them without going bankrupt. Like many Athenians, 
the family owns slaves. Originally from Thrace,
they were captured in war. Thratta does most of the housework 
and helps raise the children. Philon is a paidagôgos, who supervises the son’s education, 
teaching him reading and writing. Archias is up early because there’s 
a meeting of the Ekklêsia, the assembly of citizens, taking place at dawn. Before setting out, he burns incense and pours a libation at the small shrine 
in the courtyard on behalf of his entire household. Dexileia will remain at home all day, 
teaching her daughters domestic skills. Later, she’ll retire to the inner 
courtyard for some fresh air. When Archias arrives at the agora, the civic and commercial heart 
of the city, he finds the square swarming 
with his fellow citizens, native-born adult males who 
have completed military training. Attached to the central monument is 
a noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda. Today, there’s only one item 
of discussion: what to do with the people of Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos where a revolt against Athenian rule 
has just been put down. The meeting takes place on a hill west 
of the acropolis known as the Pnyx. The word means “tightly packed," and the crowd of 5,000 citizens 
makes it clear why. The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling 
its boundary with pig’s blood and call for order. As everyone sits on benches 
facing the platform, the presiding officer opens the meeting 
with the words: “Tis agoreuein bouleutai?” “Who wishes to address the assembly?” One by one, citizens speak, some advising 
mercy, others bent on vengeance. A motion is proposed to execute 
all the Mytileneans and enslave their women and children because they betrayed their Athenian 
allies during a time of war. A majority raises their right hands 
in favor. Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads 
back to the agora to buy food and wine. Hundreds have gathered there 
to discuss the results, many unhappy with the decision. When Archias returns home, 
he tells Dexileia about the debate. She thinks that killing the innocent 
as well as the guilty is harsh and counterproductive, and tells him as much. Around dusk, Archias goes to

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to "Five Dangerous Things
You Should Let Your Children Do." I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer
scientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something
called the Tinkering School. It's a summer program
which aims to help kids learn how to build the things
that they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools
into the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending
your kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,
scraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more
stringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be
any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings
on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item
in the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item
sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner
and eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids
come in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries
of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children
from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact
with the world around them. And despite all of our best
efforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous
thing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things
that we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control
of the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called "50 Dangerous Things." This is "Five Dangerous Things." Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most
elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment
in any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity
to play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things
we ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn
some basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working
elements of fire that you have to have
for a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit
fire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going
to learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it
on their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing
with Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting
out of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife
is like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures
they give knives -- like, as soon as they're
toddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children
cutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian
Film Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop
an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple
of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,
keep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids
can understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs
from where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.
They heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains
are actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't
use parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength
to the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things
has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with
visual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization
skills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination
of analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind
of whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices
also help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things
inside your dishwasher. Next time you're about
to throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,
and we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense
that they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,
they can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,
that something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with
and take for granted are actually complex things
made by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit
how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,
digital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,
and play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA
could come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson
for kids to understand, that some of these laws
get broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often
talk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things
and breaking them open, and taking them apart
and using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act
for a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable
actually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto
things like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,
and they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them
a handle on a world in a way that they don't often
have access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,
make sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,
and let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.
That's number five and a half. OK.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Between you and the rest of the world 
lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ 
in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 
1.7 square meters of ground. Its purpose may seem obvious—
to keep our insides in. But a look beyond the surface reveals that it plays a surprising 
number of roles in our lives. First, the basics. Skin is the foundation 
of the integumentary system, which also incorporates your hair, 
nails, and specialized glands and nerves. Made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, skin’s thickness varies 
from 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest and up to four millimeters 
at its thickest. It also carries out three key functions: protecting, regulating, and sensing the world beyond its limits. On a daily basis, its huge surface 
processes hundreds, if not thousands, of physical sensations, relying mostly on large, 
pressure-sensitive skin components called Merkel cells. In your fingertips alone, there are 750 Merkel cells 
per each square-centimeter of skin, coupled with over 2,500 receptors
that give you your sense of touch. This surface is also the body’s first 
major line of defense. Without it, you’d be a soggy mass 
of tissue and fluids, fatally exposed to the elements. Skin effectively seals off your insides and also absorbs pressure and shock with flexible collagen 
that makes up most of its dermal layer. The epidermis is made up mainly 
of skin cells called keratinocytes that are completely replaced 
every four weeks. As new cells form at the base of the
epidermis, older ones are pushed up. When these cells move upwards, they’re filled with a hardened protein 
called keratin. Once they reach the surface, they form a tightly-overlapping, 
waterproof layer that’s difficult for invading 
microbes to breach. Any harmful microbes that make it 
into the epidermis will encounter Langerhans cells. This group of protective skin cells 
detects invaders and communicates their presence 
to resident immune system T-cells, which react by launching 
an immune response. A crucial feature of this immune defense is the several thousand 
species of microorganisms that inhabit the planes, folds, and crevices of your skin. These microbes, 
which include bacteria and fungi, thrive in the sebum, an oily substance that’s secreted 
onto the skin’s surface by sebaceous glands nestled
inside the dermis. These skin microbes keep the immune system
in a state of constant surveillance, ensuring that it’s ready to react 
if the body really is at risk. Beyond this protective role, your skin is also a sensory organ that
helps regulate your body’s temperature, two roles that are closely interlinked. Nerves detect whether your skin 
is warm or cold and communicate that
information to your brain. In return, the brain instructs
localized blood vessels to either expand if the body is too warm, releasing heat from 
the blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,
which retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's
blood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat
via ducts onto the surface, transferring heat out of the body. Hair can also be stimulated
to conserve or release body warmth. The average human 
has 5 million hair follicles embedded everywhere on the body except the palms of your hands 
and soles of your feet. Ninety to 150,000 of those 
are on your scalp, where they help shield
the large surface area of your head from physical damage and sunburn. When you're cold, tiny muscles 
called arrector pilli cause hair to stand upright
across the body. That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps
and it traps body heat close to your skin. Skin’s vast surface isn’t just a shield; it also enables us to interact 
and connect with the world. Its multifunctional layer cools us down
and keeps us warm. The integumentary system 
may be many things, but it’s certainly more than skin deep.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Between you and the rest of the world 
lies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ 
in your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to 
1.7 square meters of ground. Its purpose may seem obvious—
to keep our insides in. But a look beyond the surface reveals that it plays a surprising 
number of roles in our lives. First, the basics. Skin is the foundation 
of the integumentary system, which also incorporates your hair, 
nails, and specialized glands and nerves. Made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, skin’s thickness varies 
from 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest and up to four millimeters 
at its thickest. It also carries out three key functions: protecting, regulating, and sensing the world beyond its limits. On a daily basis, its huge surface 
processes hundreds, if not thousands, of physical sensations, relying mostly on large, 
pressure-sensitive skin components called Merkel cells. In your fingertips alone, there are 750 Merkel cells 
per each square-centimeter of skin, coupled with over 2,500 receptors
that give you your sense of touch. This surface is also the body’s first 
major line of defense. Without it, you’d be a soggy mass 
of tissue and fluids, fatally exposed to the elements. Skin effectively seals off your insides and also absorbs pressure and shock with flexible collagen 
that makes up most of its dermal layer. The epidermis is made up mainly 
of skin cells called keratinocytes that are completely replaced 
every four weeks. As new cells form at the base of the
epidermis, older ones are pushed up. When these cells move upwards, they’re filled with a hardened protein 
called keratin. Once they reach the surface, they form a tightly-overlapping, 
waterproof layer that’s difficult for invading 
microbes to breach. Any harmful microbes that make it 
into the epidermis will encounter Langerhans cells. This group of protective skin cells 
detects invaders and communicates their presence 
to resident immune system T-cells, which react by launching 
an immune response. A crucial feature of this immune defense is the several thousand 
species of microorganisms that inhabit the planes, folds, and crevices of your skin. These microbes, 
which include bacteria and fungi, thrive in the sebum, an oily substance that’s secreted 
onto the skin’s surface by sebaceous glands nestled
inside the dermis. These skin microbes keep the immune system
in a state of constant surveillance, ensuring that it’s ready to react 
if the body really is at risk. Beyond this protective role, your skin is also a sensory organ that
helps regulate your body’s temperature, two roles that are closely interlinked. Nerves detect whether your skin 
is warm or cold and communicate that
information to your brain. In return, the brain instructs
localized blood vessels to either expand if the body is too warm, releasing heat from 
the blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,
which retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's
blood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat
via ducts onto the surface, transferring heat out of the body. Hair can also be stimulated
to conserve or release body warmth. The average human 
has 5 million hair follicles embedded everywhere on the body except the palms of your hands 
and soles of your feet. Ninety to 150,000 of those 
are on your scalp, where they help shield
the large surface area of your head from physical damage and sunburn. When you're cold, tiny muscles 
called arrector pilli cause hair to stand upright
across the body. That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps
and it traps body heat close to your skin. Skin’s vast surface isn’t just a shield; it also enables us to interact 
and connect with the world. Its multifunctional layer cools us down
and keeps us warm. The integumentary system 
may be many things, but it’s certainly more than skin deep.

**Transcript**:
With his harebrained schemes 
and asinine dealings with the gods, King Midas ruled the ancient kingdom 
of Phrygia with an uneven hand. He was known in Greek mythology 
as a rogue ruler whose antics bemused his people 
and distracted the gods. Midas spent his days 
in a stupor of splendor, spoiling himself and his beloved daughter
and gorging himself on feasts and wine. Unsurprisingly, he felt 
an affinity with Dionysus, god of wine, carnival, and performance. One day, Midas discovered a satyr dozing in his rose garden and drunk 
on more than the scent of flowers. Midas recognized the satyr 
as one of Dionysus’s followers and let him nurse 
his hangover at the palace. Pleased with the king’s hospitality,
Dionysus offered to grant him one wish. Midas cast a greedy eye 
over his surroundings. Despite the luxury in which he lived, no amount of precious jewels, finest silk 
or splendid decor felt like enough. His life, he thought, was lacking luster;
what he needed was more gold. The god sent the power to turn anything
the king touched to gold surging through Midas. Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions. At his lightest touch, 
the palace walls transformed, stone statues shone, and goblets glittered. He galloped through his home in a frenzy, handling each item until 
it took on a lustrous sheen. Soon the palace heaved with gold, and Midas’s delirious
laughter echoed off the walls. Exhausted and hungry from his rampage, Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from 
his newly gilded fruit bowl. But he nearly shattered his teeth, for the fruit had turned 
to metal in his mouth. When he picked up a loaf of bread, 
the crumbs hardened in his hand. Flinging himself onto 
his bed in frustration, Midas discovered his plush pillows 
had morphed into solid gold. Hearing his cries of frustration, 
his daughter entered the room. But when Midas reached out to her, he saw with horror that he had frozen her 
into a golden statue. Horrified at what he had done, Midas begged the gods 
to rid him of his power. Taking pity on the foolish king, Dionysus told Midas to wash 
his hands in the River Pactolus. When Midas reached into the river, 
the gold drained from his fingertips. Midas returned home 
to find his daughter alive and his palace back to normal, 
and he rejoiced. You’d think he would’ve learned 
his lesson, but just a few weeks later,
Midas blundered again, insulting the music and sun god Apollo 
when he declared Pan a greater musician. Apollo scornfully declared that the king 
must have the ears of an ass to make such a misjudgment,
and transformed Midas accordingly. Once again regretting his behavior, Midas kept his hairy ears 
hidden in public. They were seen only by his barber, who was sworn to secrecy during 
a very awkward grooming session. The barber stifled his laughter 
and fought the desire to tell someone, yet the secret consumed him. One day, he walked outside the city 
and dug a hole in the ground. Plunging his head into the earth, the desperate barber whispered,
“Midas has ass’s ears.” Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up in the spot where the barber 
had buried his words. When the wind blew, they carried the 
echoes of his whisper through the breeze: "Midas has ass’s ears." At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised
their heads in recognition and people chuckled to themselves 
at the follies of their king. With his golden touch and ass’s ears, 
Midas was not the most respected ruler. And where other leaders were honored 
through statues and temples, his people remembered him 
a little differently: in the depths of the glittering river 
and the rustle of the Phrygian wind.

on more than the scent of flowers. Midas recognized the satyr 
as one of Dionysus’s followers and let him nurse 
his hangover at the palace. Pleased with the king’s hospitality,
Dionysus offered to grant him one wish. Midas cast a greedy eye 
over his surroundings. Despite the luxury in which he lived, no amount of precious jewels, finest silk 
or splendid decor felt like enough. His life, he thought, was lacking luster;
what he needed was more gold. The god sent the power to turn anything
the king touched to gold surging through Midas. Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions. At his lightest touch, 
the palace walls transformed, stone statues shone, and goblets glittered. He galloped through his home in a frenzy, handling each item until 
it took on a lustrous sheen. Soon the palace heaved with gold, and Midas’s delirious
laughter echoed off the walls. Exhausted and hungry from his rampage, Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from 
his newly gilded fruit bowl. But he nearly shattered his teeth, for the fruit had turned 
to metal in his mouth. When he picked up a loaf of bread, 
the crumbs hardened in his hand. Flinging himself onto 
his bed in frustration, Midas discovered his plush pillows 
had morphed into solid gold. Hearing his cries of frustration, 
his daughter entered the room. But when Midas reached out to her, he saw with horror that he had frozen her 
into a golden statue. Horrified at what he had done, Midas begged the gods 
to rid him of his power. Taking pity on the foolish king, Dionysus told Midas to wash 
his hands in the River Pactolus. When Midas reached into the river, 
the gold drained from his fingertips. Midas returned home 
to find his daughter alive and his palace back to normal, 
and he rejoiced. You’d think he would’ve learned 
his lesson, but just a few weeks later,
Midas blundered again, insulting the music and sun god Apollo 
when he declared Pan a greater musician. Apollo scornfully declared that the king 
must have the ears of an ass to make such a misjudgment,
and transformed Midas accordingly. Once again regretting his behavior, Midas kept his hairy ears 
hidden in public. They were seen only by his barber, who was sworn to secrecy during 
a very awkward grooming session. The barber stifled his laughter 
and fought the desire to tell someone, yet the secret consumed him. One day, he walked outside the city 
and dug a hole in the ground. Plunging his head into the earth, the desperate barber whispered,
“Midas has ass’s ears.” Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up in the spot where the barber 
had buried his words. When the wind blew, they carried the 
echoes of his whisper through the breeze: "Midas has ass’s ears." At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised
their heads in recognition and people chuckled to themselves 
at the follies of their king. With his golden touch and ass’s ears, 
Midas was not the most respected ruler. And where other leaders were honored 
through statues and temples, his people remembered him 
a little differently: in the depths of the glittering river 
and the rustle of the Phrygian wind.

**Transcript**:
Thor—son of Odin, god of thunder, 
and protector of mankind— struggled mightily against his greatest
challenge yet: opening a bag of food. It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants. Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and
even carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,
Skrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached 
a massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, 
they met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were 
the best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself 
the world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed. But when the contestants 
met in the center, Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones 
and even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions. The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess, which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves 
harder than ever before and changed the world 
in ways no one had expected.

**Transcript**:
Thor—son of Odin, god of thunder, 
and protector of mankind— struggled mightily against his greatest
challenge yet: opening a bag of food. It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant
Thjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, 
land of the giants. Along the way, they’d met 
a giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and
even carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,
Skrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried 
to wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer 
Mjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought 
it was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached 
a massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, 
they met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were 
the best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself 
the world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed. But when the contestants 
met in the center, Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones 
and even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions. The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess, which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves 
harder than ever before and changed the world 
in ways no one had expected.

the world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned 
his servant Logi and the two were placed at either 
end of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward 
with blinding speed. But when the contestants 
met in the center, Loki saw that his adversary 
had not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones 
and even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could 
outrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking 
giant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up 
and demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never 
seen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, 
running like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men 
could drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly 
cold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead 
in the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king
offered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, 
it arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, 
he only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded 
to wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned 
the giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, 
Thor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,
until he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared 
to leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle 
had been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because 
his opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because
Hugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, 
or old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, 
they had also been illusions. The drinking horn 
was filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained
enough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent 
that encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been 
Utgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form
valleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated 
them on their prowess, which so frightened him he would 
never allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed 
the challenges presented to them. But in trying to achieve the impossible, they’d pushed themselves 
harder than ever before and changed the world 
in ways no one had expected.

**Transcript**:
It was the Western Hemisphere’s 
largest empire ever, with a population 
of nearly 10 million subjects. Over an area of more 
than 900,000 square kilometers, its people built massive 
administrative centers, temples, and extensive road 
and canal systems. They did so in an inhospitable, 
extreme terrain, all without the use of wheels, 
horses, iron, or even written language. Yet within 100 years of its rise 
in the fifteenth century, the Inca Empire would be no more. According to legend, the ancestors of the Inca rulers 
were created by the sun god Inti, and they emerged
from a cave called Tambo Toco. Leading four brothers 
and four sisters was Ayar Manco, who carried a golden staff 
with instructions to find the place where 
it would sink into the ground, showing fertile soil. After many adventures 
and extensive searching, Ayar Manco and his siblings 
reached the Cuzco Valley, where the staff pierced the ground. After fighting off the fierce 
local native population, they founded their capital, and Ayar Manco became Manco Capac, 
the first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Incas first settled 
in this valley around 1200 CE. They remained a small kingdom until 1438, when they were nearly overrun 
by the neighboring Chanka tribe. The Inca king at this time, Viracocha, 
and his designated heir fled in fear, but one of his other sons remained and successfully rallied 
the city’s defenses. For his military skill, he became 
the ninth Inca ruler, assuming the name of Pachacuti, 
or "Cataclysm." Pachacuti expanded Inca rule 
throughout the Andes mountains, transforming the kingdom into 
an empire through extensive reforms. The empire’s territory was reorganized 
as Tahuantinsuyu, or "four quarters," with four divisions ruled 
by governors reporting to the king. Although the Inca had no writing, they used a complex system 
of knotted strings called quipu to record numbers 
and perhaps other information. A decimal-based bureaucracy 
enabled systematic and efficient taxation 
of the empire’s subjects. In return, the empire provided security, 
infrastructure, and sustenance, with great storehouses containing 
necessities to be used when needed. Great terraces and irrigation works 
were built and various crops were grown in 
at different altitudes to be transported all over the empire. And it was during Pachacuti’s reign that the famous estate 
of Machu Picchu was constructed. Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca continued 
the empire’s military expansion, and he eventually became ruler
in 1471 CE. By the end of his reign, the empire 
covered much of western South America. Topa’s son Huayna Capac 
succeeded him in 1493. But the new ruler’s distant military 
campaigns strained the social fabric. And in 1524, Huayna Capac 
was stricken by fever. Spanish conquistadors had arrived 
in the Caribbean some time before, bringing diseases to which 
the native peoples had no resistance. Millions died in the outbreak, including Huayna Capac
and his designated heir. The vacant throne ignited a civil war
between two of the surviving brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, greatly weakening the empire. In 1532, after finally winning 
the Inca civil war, Atahualpa and his army 
encountered the European invaders. Although greatly outnumbered, Francisco Pizarro 
and his small group of conquistadors stunned the king’s much larger force 
with guns and horses, neither of which they had seen before. Atahualpa was taken captive 
and killed about a year later. The Spanish conquerors 
were awed by the capital of Cuzco. Pizarro described it as so beautiful that
“it would be remarkable even in Spain.” Though the capital had fallen and the native population had been
destroyed by civil war and disease, some Incas fell back to 
a new capital at Vilcabamba and resisted for the next 40 years. But by 1572, the Spaniards had destroyed 
all remaining resistance along with much of the Incas’ physical 
and cultural legacy. Thus, the great Inca empire fell 
even faster than it had risen.

**Transcript**:
It was the Western Hemisphere’s 
largest empire ever, with a population 
of nearly 10 million subjects. Over an area of more 
than 900,000 square kilometers, its people built massive 
administrative centers, temples, and extensive road 
and canal systems. They did so in an inhospitable, 
extreme terrain, all without the use of wheels, 
horses, iron, or even written language. Yet within 100 years of its rise 
in the fifteenth century, the Inca Empire would be no more. According to legend, the ancestors of the Inca rulers 
were created by the sun god Inti, and they emerged
from a cave called Tambo Toco. Leading four brothers 
and four sisters was Ayar Manco, who carried a golden staff 
with instructions to find the place where 
it would sink into the ground, showing fertile soil. After many adventures 
and extensive searching, Ayar Manco and his siblings 
reached the Cuzco Valley, where the staff pierced the ground. After fighting off the fierce 
local native population, they founded their capital, and Ayar Manco became Manco Capac, 
the first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Incas first settled 
in this valley around 1200 CE. They remained a small kingdom until 1438, when they were nearly overrun 
by the neighboring Chanka tribe. The Inca king at this time, Viracocha, 
and his designated heir fled in fear, but one of his other sons remained and successfully rallied 
the city’s defenses. For his military skill, he became 
the ninth Inca ruler, assuming the name of Pachacuti, 
or "Cataclysm." Pachacuti expanded Inca rule 
throughout the Andes mountains, transforming the kingdom into 
an empire through extensive reforms. The empire’s territory was reorganized 
as Tahuantinsuyu, or "four quarters," with four divisions ruled 
by governors reporting to the king. Although the Inca had no writing, they used a complex system 
of knotted strings called quipu to record numbers 
and perhaps other information. A decimal-based bureaucracy 
enabled systematic and efficient taxation 
of the empire’s subjects. In return, the empire provided security, 
infrastructure, and sustenance, with great storehouses containing 
necessities to be used when needed. Great terraces and irrigation works 
were built and various crops were grown in 
at different altitudes to be transported all over the empire. And it was during Pachacuti’s reign that the famous estate 
of Machu Picchu was constructed. Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca continued 
the empire’s military expansion, and he eventually became ruler
in 1471 CE. By the end of his reign, the empire 
covered much of western South America. Topa’s son Huayna Capac 
succeeded him in 1493. But the new ruler’s distant military 
campaigns strained the social fabric. And in 1524, Huayna Capac 
was stricken by fever. Spanish conquistadors had arrived 
in the Caribbean some time before, bringing diseases to which 
the native peoples had no resistance. Millions died in the outbreak, including Huayna Capac
and his designated heir. The vacant throne ignited a civil war
between two of the surviving brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, greatly weakening the empire. In 1532, after finally winning 
the Inca civil war, Atahualpa and his army 
encountered the European invaders. Although greatly outnumbered, Francisco Pizarro 
and his small group of conquistadors stunned the king’s much larger force 
with guns and horses, neither of which they had seen before. Atahualpa was taken captive 
and killed about a year later. The Spanish conquerors 
were awed by the capital of Cuzco. Pizarro described it as so beautiful that
“it would be remarkable even in Spain.” Though the capital had fallen and the native population had been
destroyed by civil war and disease, some Incas fell back to 
a new capital at Vilcabamba and resisted for the next 40 years. But by 1572, the Spaniards had destroyed 
all remaining resistance along with much of the Incas’ physical 
and cultural legacy. Thus, the great Inca empire fell 
even faster than it had risen.

**Transcript**:
From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted 
the beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters. The powerful gods usually changed 
their own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations 
were often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation 
befell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter 
of a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth 
the deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning 
the finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands 
flying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly 
from her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew, 
so did her pride. Arachne could often be heard 
boasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed 
anyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving 
as a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it 
as her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom 
and crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne 
making these claims. Planning to teach 
the ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman
and stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim
herself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed, 
barely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off
her cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her 
to a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance 
of the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom 
as a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began, 
eyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured 
wisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass 
from below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes 
that showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry, 
the glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest 
in boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods
abusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer,
transfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned
to the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods 
in the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone 
with her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement 
and lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably
better and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage 
and turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body
shrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly 
as her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair
sprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single 
spool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption
that the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary 
into the first spider. To this day, Arachne and her children spin
out her penance— or is it undaunted persistence?— in the shadows of giants.

so did her pride. Arachne could often be heard 
boasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed 
anyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving 
as a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it 
as her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom 
and crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne 
making these claims. Planning to teach 
the ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman
and stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim
herself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed, 
barely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off
her cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her 
to a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance 
of the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom 
as a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began, 
eyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured 
wisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass 
from below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes 
that showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry, 
the glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest 
in boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods
abusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer,
transfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned
to the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods 
in the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone 
with her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement 
and lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably
better and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage 
and turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body
shrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly 
as her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair
sprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single 
spool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption
that the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary 
into the first spider. To this day, Arachne and her children spin
out her penance— or is it undaunted persistence?— in the shadows of giants.

**Transcript**:
From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted 
the beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters. The powerful gods usually changed 
their own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations 
were often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation 
befell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter 
of a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth 
the deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning 
the finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands 
flying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly 
from her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew, 
so did her pride. Arachne could often be heard 
boasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed

**Transcript**:
You may take them for granted, 
but your teeth are a marvel. They break up all your food 
over the course of your life, while being strong enough
to withstand breakage themselves. And they’re formed using 
only the raw materials from the food they grind down 
in the first place. What’s behind their impressive strength? Teeth rely on an ingenious structure 
that makes them both hard and tough. Hardness can be thought of as the ability 
to resist a crack from starting, while toughness is what stops 
the crack from spreading Very few materials have both properties. For instance, glass is hard but not tough, while leather is tough but not hard. Teeth manage both by having two layers: a hard external cap of enamel, made up
almost entirely of a calcium phosphate, and beneath it, 
a tougher layer of dentin, partly formed from organic fibers 
that make it flexible. This amazing structure is created 
by two types of cells: ameloblasts that secrete enamel and odontoblasts that secrete dentin. As they form teeth, 
odontoblasts move inward, while ameloblasts move out 
and slough off when they hit the surface. For enamel, this process produces long, 
thin strands, each about 60 nanometers in diameter. That’s one one-thousandth 
the width of a human hair. Those are bundled into rods, 
packed together, tens of thousands per square millimeter, to form the shield-like enamel layer. Once this process is finished, 
your enamel can’t repair itself again because all the cells 
that make it are lost, so we’re lucky that enamel 
can’t be easily destroyed. Odontoblasts use a more complex process,
but unlike ameloblasts, they stick around, continuing to secrete dentin 
throughout your life. Despite the differences in teeth 
across the mammalian order, the underlying process of tooth growth 
is the same whether it’s for lions, kangaroos, elephants, or us. What changes is how nature sculpts 
the shape of the tooth, altering the folding and growth patterns to suit the distinct diets 
of different species. Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel 
ridges for grinding tough grasses. Cats have sharp crested molars, 
like blades, for shearing meat and sinew. Pigs have blunt, thick ones, 
useful for crushing hard roots and seeds. The myriad molars of modern mammals can be traced back to a common form
called “tribosphenic," which first appeared 
during the dinosaur age. In the 19th Century, 
paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope developed the basic model 
for how this form evolved. He hypothesized that 
it started with a cone-like tooth, as we see in many fishes, 
amphibians, and reptiles. Small cusps were then added, 
so the tooth had three in a row, aligned front to back,
and connected by crests. Over time, the cusps were pushed out 
of line to make triangular crowns. Adjacent teeth formed a continuous 
zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing. A low shelf then formed 
at the back of each set of teeth, which became a platform for crushing. As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar 
served as the jumping-off point for the radiation of specialized
forms to follow, each shaped by evolutionary needs. Straighten the crests 
and remove the shelf, and you’ve got the conveniently 
bladed teeth of cats and dogs. Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, 
and you’ve got our human molars. A few additional tweaks get you 
a horse or cow tooth. Some details in Cope’s intuitive
hypothesis proved wrong. But in the fossil record, there are examples of teeth 
that look just as he predicted and we can trace the molars of all living
mammals back to that primitive form. Today, the ability to consume 
diverse forms of food enables mammals to survive in habitats ranging from mountain peaks 
and ocean depths to rainforests and deserts. So the success of our biological class 
is due in no small measure to the remarkable strength 
and adaptability of the humble mammalian molar.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
You may take them for granted, 
but your teeth are a marvel. They break up all your food 
over the course of your life, while being strong enough
to withstand breakage themselves. And they’re formed using 
only the raw materials from the food they grind down 
in the first place. What’s behind their impressive strength? Teeth rely on an ingenious structure 
that makes them both hard and tough. Hardness can be thought of as the ability 
to resist a crack from starting, while toughness is what stops 
the crack from spreading Very few materials have both properties. For instance, glass is hard but not tough, while leather is tough but not hard. Teeth manage both by having two layers: a hard external cap of enamel, made up
almost entirely of a calcium phosphate, and beneath it, 
a tougher layer of dentin, partly formed from organic fibers 
that make it flexible. This amazing structure is created 
by two types of cells: ameloblasts that secrete enamel and odontoblasts that secrete dentin. As they form teeth, 
odontoblasts move inward, while ameloblasts move out 
and slough off when they hit the surface. For enamel, this process produces long, 
thin strands, each about 60 nanometers in diameter. That’s one one-thousandth 
the width of a human hair. Those are bundled into rods, 
packed together, tens of thousands per square millimeter, to form the shield-like enamel layer. Once this process is finished, 
your enamel can’t repair itself again because all the cells 
that make it are lost, so we’re lucky that enamel 
can’t be easily destroyed. Odontoblasts use a more complex process,
but unlike ameloblasts, they stick around, continuing to secrete dentin 
throughout your life. Despite the differences in teeth 
across the mammalian order, the underlying process of tooth growth 
is the same whether it’s for lions, kangaroos, elephants, or us. What changes is how nature sculpts 
the shape of the tooth, altering the folding and growth patterns to suit the distinct diets 
of different species. Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel 
ridges for grinding tough grasses. Cats have sharp crested molars, 
like blades, for shearing meat and sinew. Pigs have blunt, thick ones, 
useful for crushing hard roots and seeds. The myriad molars of modern mammals can be traced back to a common form
called “tribosphenic," which first appeared 
during the dinosaur age. In the 19th Century, 
paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope developed the basic model 
for how this form evolved. He hypothesized that 
it started with a cone-like tooth, as we see in many fishes, 
amphibians, and reptiles. Small cusps were then added, 
so the tooth had three in a row, aligned front to back,
and connected by crests. Over time, the cusps were pushed out 
of line to make triangular crowns. Adjacent teeth formed a continuous 
zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing. A low shelf then formed 
at the back of each set of teeth, which became a platform for crushing. As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar 
served as the jumping-off point for the radiation of specialized
forms to follow, each shaped by evolutionary needs. Straighten the crests 
and remove the shelf, and you’ve got the conveniently 
bladed teeth of cats and dogs. Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, 
and you’ve got our human molars. A few additional tweaks get you 
a horse or cow tooth. Some details in Cope’s intuitive
hypothesis proved wrong. But in the fossil record, there are examples of teeth 
that look just as he predicted and we can trace the molars of all living
mammals back to that primitive form. Today, the ability to consume 
diverse forms of food enables mammals to survive in habitats ranging from mountain peaks 
and ocean depths to rainforests and deserts. So the success of our biological class 
is due in no small measure to the remarkable strength 
and adaptability of the humble mammalian molar.

**Transcript**:
In a typical hero's journey, the protagonist sets out on an adventure, undergoes great change, and returns in triumph 
to their point of origin. But in the Irish genre of myth
known as Eachtraí, the journey to the other world
ends in a point of no return. While there are many different versions
of the otherworld in Irish mythology, the most well-known example occurs
in the story of Oisín. Oisín was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill,
the leader of a group of pagan warriors known as the Fianna. As Oisín rode with his companions one day, he was visited by 
the immortal princess Niamh. The two fell instantly in love and Niamh put Oisín onto her white horse and rode with him 
to the edge of the Irish sea. As they made for the horizon,
the riders sunk into a golden haze. They came to the shores of
the gleaming kingdom called Tír na nÓg. This was the home of the Tuatha Dé Danann,
the people who ruled Ancient Ireland long before Oisín's time. From the point of his arrival,
Oisín's every need was met. He married Niamh in a grand ceremony
and was welcomed into her family. When he wished to hear music,
his ears filled with bewitching tones. When he hungered, golden plates
appeared laden with fragrant food. He admired scenes of great beauty,
and colors that he had no name for. All around him, the land and the people
existed in a state of unmoving perfection. But what Oisín didn't know was that
Tír na nÓg was the land of youth, in which time stood still
and the people never aged. In his new home, Oisín continued
to hunt and explore as he had in Ireland. But in the land of youth, he possessed
a strange, new invincibility. At the end of each day of adventuring, Oisín's wounds magically healed themselves
as he slept in Niamh's arms. Although glory and pleasure
came easily to Oisín in the land of youth, he missed the Fianna
and the adventures they had in Ireland. After three years in Tír na nÓg, he
was struck by a deep yearning for home. Before he embarked on his journey back,
Niamh warned him that he must not alight from his horse
to touch the earth with his own feet. When Oisín reached the shores of Ireland, it felt as if a shadow 
had fallen over the world. On the hill where his father's palace lay,
he saw only a ruin strewn with weeds. His calls for his friends and family
echoed from derelict walls. Horrified, Oisín rode until he came upon
a group of peasants working in the fields. They were struggling to remove 
a boulder from their land, and forgetting Niamh's warning, Oisín leapt from his horse and rolled it
away with his superhuman strength. The crowd's cheers soon
turned into shrieks. In place of the youth was an old man
whose beard swept the ground and whose legs buckled under him. He cried out for Finn and the Fianna, but the people only recognized these names
from the distant past of 300 years before. Time had betrayed Oisín and his return to mortal lands
had aged him irreversibly. Throughout Irish folklore, sightings of the land of youth
have been reported in the depths of wells, on the brink of the horizon, or in the gloom of caves. But those who know the tale of Oisín
tell of another vision, that of a shining princess carried upon
the distant waves by a white horse, still hoping for the return 
of her doomed love.

**Transcript**:
In a typical hero's journey, the protagonist sets out on an adventure, undergoes great change, and returns in triumph 
to their point of origin. But in the Irish genre of myth
known as Eachtraí, the journey to the other world
ends in a point of no return. While there are many different versions
of the otherworld in Irish mythology, the most well-known example occurs
in the story of Oisín. Oisín was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill,
the leader of a group of pagan warriors known as the Fianna. As Oisín rode with his companions one day, he was visited by 
the immortal princess Niamh. The two fell instantly in love and Niamh put Oisín onto her white horse and rode with him 
to the edge of the Irish sea. As they made for the horizon,
the riders sunk into a golden haze. They came to the shores of
the gleaming kingdom called Tír na nÓg. This was the home of the Tuatha Dé Danann,
the people who ruled Ancient Ireland long before Oisín's time. From the point of his arrival,
Oisín's every need was met. He married Niamh in a grand ceremony
and was welcomed into her family. When he wished to hear music,
his ears filled with bewitching tones. When he hungered, golden plates
appeared laden with fragrant food. He admired scenes of great beauty,
and colors that he had no name for. All around him, the land and the people
existed in a state of unmoving perfection. But what Oisín didn't know was that
Tír na nÓg was the land of youth, in which time stood still
and the people never aged. In his new home, Oisín continued
to hunt and explore as he had in Ireland. But in the land of youth, he possessed
a strange, new invincibility. At the end of each day of adventuring, Oisín's wounds magically healed themselves
as he slept in Niamh's arms. Although glory and pleasure
came easily to Oisín in the land of youth, he missed the Fianna
and the adventures they had in Ireland. After three years in Tír na nÓg, he
was struck by a deep yearning for home. Before he embarked on his journey back,
Niamh warned him that he must not alight from his horse
to touch the earth with his own feet. When Oisín reached the shores of Ireland, it felt as if a shadow 
had fallen over the world. On the hill where his father's palace lay,
he saw only a ruin strewn with weeds. His calls for his friends and family
echoed from derelict walls. Horrified, Oisín rode until he came upon
a group of peasants working in the fields. They were struggling to remove 
a boulder from their land, and forgetting Niamh's warning, Oisín leapt from his horse and rolled it
away with his superhuman strength. The crowd's cheers soon
turned into shrieks. In place of the youth was an old man
whose beard swept the ground and whose legs buckled under him. He cried out for Finn and the Fianna, but the people only recognized these names
from the distant past of 300 years before. Time had betrayed Oisín and his return to mortal lands
had aged him irreversibly. Throughout Irish folklore, sightings of the land of youth
have been reported in the depths of wells, on the brink of the horizon, or in the gloom of caves. But those who know the tale of Oisín
tell of another vision, that of a shining princess carried upon
the distant waves by a white horse, still hoping for the return 
of her doomed love.

**Transcript**:
It was the perfect wedding, 
the guests thought. The groom was Orpheus,
the greatest of all poets and musicians. The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph. Anyone could tell the couple 
was truly and deeply in love. Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled, 
then fell to the ground. By the time Orpheus reached her side,
she was dead, and the snake that had bitten 
her was slithering away through the grass. Following Eurydice’s funeral, Orpheus was overcome with a grief 
the human world could not contain, and so he decided he would journey 
to the land of the dead, a place from which no living creature 
had ever returned, to rescue his beloved. When Orpheus reached the gates of the
underworld, he began to strum his lyre. The music was so beautiful that Cerberus,
the three-headed dog who guards the dead, lay down as Orpheus passed. Charon, the ferry captain who charged 
dead souls to cross the River Styx, was so moved by the music that he brought 
Orpheus across free of charge. When Orpheus entered 
the palace of Hades and Persephone, the king and queen of the dead, he began to sing. He sang of his love for Eurydice, 
and said she had been taken away too soon. The day would come when she, 
like all living creatures, dwelled in the land of the
dead for all eternity, so couldn’t Hades grant 
her just a few more years on Earth? In the moment after Orpheus finished, 
all hell stood still. Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock
up the hill. Tantalus did not reach for the water 
he would never be allowed to drink. Even the Furies, 
the demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept. Hades and Persephone granted
Orpheus’s plea, but on one condition. As he climbed back out of the underworld, he must not turn around to see 
if Eurydice was following behind him. If he did, she would return
to the land of the dead forever. Orpheus began to climb. With each step, he worried more and more 
about whether Eurydice was behind him. He heard nothing—
where were her footsteps? Finally, just before he stepped out 
of the underworld and into the bright light of day, he gave into temptation. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld,
but was refused entry. Separated from Eurydice, Orpheus swore never
to love another woman again. Instead, he sat in a grove of trees 
and sang songs of lovers. There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy 
who Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods. There was Myrrah, who loved her father 
and was punished for it, and Pygmalion, who sculpted 
his ideal woman out of ivory, then prayed to Venus 
until she came to life. And there was Venus herself, whose beautiful Adonis 
was killed by a wild boar. It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss had allowed him to see into 
the hearts of gods and people everywhere. For some, however, poetry was not enough. A group of wild women called the Maenads could not bear the thought that a poet 
who sang so beautifully of love would not love them. Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy 
and they destroyed poor Orpheus. The birds, nature’s singers, 
mourned Orpheus, as did the rivers, 
who made music as they babbled. The world had lost two great souls. Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other 
so deeply that when they were separated, Orpheus had understood 
the pain and joys of lovers everywhere, and a new art form, 
the love poem, was born. While the world wept, Orpheus found peace,
and his other half, in the underworld. There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice
along the banks of the River Styx. Sometimes, they stroll side by side; sometimes, she is in front; and sometimes, he takes the lead, turning 
to look back at her as often as he likes.

**Transcript**:
It was the perfect wedding, 
the guests thought. The groom was Orpheus,
the greatest of all poets and musicians. The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph. Anyone could tell the couple 
was truly and deeply in love. Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled, 
then fell to the ground. By the time Orpheus reached her side,
she was dead, and the snake that had bitten 
her was slithering away through the grass. Following Eurydice’s funeral, Orpheus was overcome with a grief 
the human world could not contain, and so he decided he would journey 
to the land of the dead, a place from which no living creature 
had ever returned, to rescue his beloved. When Orpheus reached the gates of the
underworld, he began to strum his lyre. The music was so beautiful that Cerberus,
the three-headed dog who guards the dead, lay down as Orpheus passed. Charon, the ferry captain who charged 
dead souls to cross the River Styx, was so moved by the music that he brought 
Orpheus across free of charge. When Orpheus entered 
the palace of Hades and Persephone, the king and queen of the dead, he began to sing. He sang of his love for Eurydice, 
and said she had been taken away too soon. The day would come when she, 
like all living creatures, dwelled in the land of the
dead for all eternity, so couldn’t Hades grant 
her just a few more years on Earth? In the moment after Orpheus finished, 
all hell stood still. Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock
up the hill. Tantalus did not reach for the water 
he would never be allowed to drink. Even the Furies, 
the demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept. Hades and Persephone granted
Orpheus’s plea, but on one condition. As he climbed back out of the underworld, he must not turn around to see 
if Eurydice was following behind him. If he did, she would return
to the land of the dead forever. Orpheus began to climb. With each step, he worried more and more 
about whether Eurydice was behind him. He heard nothing—
where were her footsteps? Finally, just before he stepped out 
of the underworld and into the bright light of day, he gave into temptation. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld,
but was refused entry. Separated from Eurydice, Orpheus swore never
to love another woman again. Instead, he sat in a grove of trees 
and sang songs of lovers. There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy 
who Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods. There was Myrrah, who loved her father 
and was punished for it, and Pygmalion, who sculpted 
his ideal woman out of ivory, then prayed to Venus 
until she came to life. And there was Venus herself, whose beautiful Adonis 
was killed by a wild boar. It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss had allowed him to see into 
the hearts of gods and people everywhere. For some, however, poetry was not enough. A group of wild women called the Maenads could not bear the thought that a poet 
who sang so beautifully of love would not love them. Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy 
and they destroyed poor Orpheus. The birds, nature’s singers, 
mourned Orpheus, as did the rivers, 
who made music as they babbled. The world had lost two great souls. Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other 
so deeply that when they were separated, Orpheus had understood 
the pain and joys of lovers everywhere, and a new art form, 
the love poem, was born. While the world wept, Orpheus found peace,
and his other half, in the underworld. There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice
along the banks of the River Styx. Sometimes, they stroll side by side; sometimes, she is in front; and sometimes, he takes the lead, turning 
to look back at her as often as he likes.

**Transcript**:
A mosquito lands on your arm, injects its chemicals into your skin, 
and begins to feed. You wouldn’t even know it was there,
if not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by a telltale itch. It’s a nuisance, but that bump 
is an important signal that you’re protected 
by your immune system, your body’s major safeguard 
against infection, illness, and disease. This system is a vast network of cells, 
tissues, and organs that coordinate your body’s defenses 
against any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to billions 
of bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor
as a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal. The immune system relies on millions 
of defensive white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, that originate in our bone marrow. These cells migrate into the bloodstream
and the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps 
clear bodily toxins and waste. Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 
and 11,000 in every microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes 
work like security personnel, constantly screening the blood, 
tissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system mainly relies 
on cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface 
of pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s 
protective immune response to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response 
has to be equally adaptable. That means relying on many 
different types of leukocytes to tackle threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify 
leukocytes in two main cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger 
the immune response by sending macrophages 
and dendritic cells into the blood. As these circulate, they destroy
any foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders 
they just ingested and transmit this information 
to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense, the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells
go in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information gathered 
from the unique antigens to start producing special proteins 
called antibodies. This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching 
antibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce millions of these, which then cycle through the body 
and attack the invaders until the worst of the
threat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, 
familiar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed 
to aid the immune response. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria
and viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid
leak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts phagocytes, which consume the invaders
and the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response 
will eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill,
but that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous 
levels inside your body. And through constant 
surveillance over time, the immune system 
provides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells identify antigens, they can use that information 
to recognize invaders in the future. So, when a threat revisits, the cells
can swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it before it affects 
any more cells. That’s how you can develop immunity 
to certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system into attacking the body’s own 
perfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes them, but these disorders sabotage 
the immune system to varying degrees, and underlie problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals, however, a healthy immune system will successfully
fight off an estimated 300 colds and innumerable other potential infections
over the course of a lifetime. Without it, those threats would escalate 
into something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a cold 
or scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our lives.

and the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps 
clear bodily toxins and waste. Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 
and 11,000 in every microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes 
work like security personnel, constantly screening the blood, 
tissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system mainly relies 
on cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface 
of pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s 
protective immune response to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response 
has to be equally adaptable. That means relying on many 
different types of leukocytes to tackle threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify 
leukocytes in two main cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger 
the immune response by sending macrophages 
and dendritic cells into the blood. As these circulate, they destroy
any foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders 
they just ingested and transmit this information 
to the second major cell group orchestrating the defense, the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells
go in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information gathered 
from the unique antigens to start producing special proteins 
called antibodies. This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching 
antibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce millions of these, which then cycle through the body 
and attack the invaders until the worst of the
threat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, 
familiar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed 
to aid the immune response. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria
and viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid
leak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts phagocytes, which consume the invaders
and the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response 
will eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill,
but that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous 
levels inside your body. And through constant 
surveillance over time, the immune system 
provides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells identify antigens, they can use that information 
to recognize invaders in the future. So, when a threat revisits, the cells
can swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it before it affects 
any more cells. That’s how you can develop immunity 
to certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system into attacking the body’s own 
perfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes them, but these disorders sabotage 
the immune system to varying degrees, and underlie problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals, however, a healthy immune system will successfully
fight off an estimated 300 colds and innumerable other potential infections
over the course of a lifetime. Without it, those threats would escalate 
into something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a cold 
or scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our lives.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The starving orphan seeking 
a second helping of gruel. The spinster wasting away 
in her tattered wedding dress. The stone-hearted miser plagued 
by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures
from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work 
that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's
writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, 
plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept
his audience wanting more. When first published, 
his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters
at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books. This prompted fevered speculation
over the cliffhangers and revelations he devised. Serialization not only made fiction
available to a wider audience and kept them reading, but increased the hype
around the author himself. Dickens became particularly popular
for his wit, which he poured into quirky characters
and satiric scenarios. His characters exhibit the sheer
absurdity of human behavior, and their names often personify
traits or social positions, like the downtrodden Bob Cratchit, the groveling Uriah Heep, and the cheery Septimus Crisparkle. Dickens set these colorful characters
against intricate social backdrops, which mimic the society he lived in. For instance, he often considered the changes brought about 
by the Industrial Revolution. During this period, the lower classes experienced 
sordid working and living conditions. Dickens himself experienced 
this hardship as a child when he was forced to work in
a boot blacking factory after his father was sent 
to debtors' prison. This influenced his depiction
of the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit, where the titular character cares
for her convict father. Prisons, orphanages, or slums
may seem grim settings for a story, but they allowed Dickens to shed light on how his society's 
most invisible people lived. In Nicholas Nickleby, Nicholas takes a job with the schoolmaster
Wackford Squeers. He soon realizes that Squeers
is running a scam where he takes unwanted children
from their parents for a fee and subjects them to violence
and deprivation. Oliver Twist also deals with the plight 
of children in the care of the state, illustrating the brutal conditions of
the workhouse in which Oliver pleads
with Mr. Bumble for food. When he flees to London, he becomes
ensnared in a criminal underworld. These stories frequently portray
Victorian life as grimy, corrupt, and cruel. But Dickens also saw his time
as one in which old traditions were fading away. London was becoming
the incubator of the modern world through new patterns in industry,
trade, and social mobility. Dickens's London is therefore
a dualistic space: a harsh world that is simultaneously
filled with wonder and possibility. For instance, the enigma 
of Great Expectations centers around the potential of Pip, an orphan plucked from obscurity
by an anonymous benefactor and propelled into high society. In his search for purpose, Pip becomes the victim 
of other people’s ambitions for him and must negotiate with 
a shadowy cast of characters. Like many of Dickens’s protagonists, poor Pip's position

over who Dickens intended as the murderer, and whether Edwin Drood

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The starving orphan seeking 
a second helping of gruel. The spinster wasting away 
in her tattered wedding dress. The stone-hearted miser plagued 
by the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures
from the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work 
that it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's
writing that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, 
plot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept
his audience wanting more. When first published, 
his stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters
at a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books. This prompted fevered speculation
over the cliffhangers and revelations he devised. Serialization not only made fiction
available to a wider audience and kept them reading, but increased the hype
around the author himself. Dickens became particularly popular
for his wit, which he poured into quirky characters
and satiric scenarios. His characters exhibit the sheer
absurdity of human behavior, and their names often personify
traits or social positions, like the downtrodden Bob Cratchit, the groveling Uriah Heep, and the cheery Septimus Crisparkle. Dickens set these colorful characters
against intricate social backdrops, which mimic the society he lived in. For instance, he often considered the changes brought about 
by the Industrial Revolution. During this period, the lower classes experienced 
sordid working and living conditions. Dickens himself experienced 
this hardship as a child when he was forced to work in
a boot blacking factory after his father was sent 
to debtors' prison. This influenced his depiction
of the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit, where the titular character cares
for her convict father. Prisons, orphanages, or slums
may seem grim settings for a story, but they allowed Dickens to shed light on how his society's 
most invisible people lived. In Nicholas Nickleby, Nicholas takes a job with the schoolmaster
Wackford Squeers. He soon realizes that Squeers
is running a scam where he takes unwanted children
from their parents for a fee and subjects them to violence
and deprivation. Oliver Twist also deals with the plight 
of children in the care of the state, illustrating the brutal conditions of
the workhouse in which Oliver pleads
with Mr. Bumble for food. When he flees to London, he becomes
ensnared in a criminal underworld. These stories frequently portray
Victorian life as grimy, corrupt, and cruel. But Dickens also saw his time
as one in which old traditions were fading away. London was becoming
the incubator of the modern world through new patterns in industry,
trade, and social mobility. Dickens's London is therefore
a dualistic space: a harsh world that is simultaneously
filled with wonder and possibility. For instance, the enigma 
of Great Expectations centers around the potential of Pip, an orphan plucked from obscurity
by an anonymous benefactor and propelled into high society. In his search for purpose, Pip becomes the victim 
of other people’s ambitions for him and must negotiate with 
a shadowy cast of characters. Like many of Dickens’s protagonists, poor Pip's position 
is constantly destabilized, just one of the reasons 
why reading Dickens is the best of times for the reader, while being the worst of times 
for his characters. Dickens typically offered clear

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 19, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 8
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1800, the explorer 
Alexander von Humboldt witnessed a swarm of electric eels
leap out of the water to defend themselves 
against oncoming horses. Most people thought the story
so unusual that Humboldt made it up. But fish using electricity is more common
than you might think; and yes, electric eels are a type of fish. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways
to communicate, navigate, and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey. Nearly 350 species of fish
have specialized anatomical structures that generate 
and detect electrical signals. These fish are divided into two groups, depending on how much 
electricity they produce. Scientists call the first group
the weakly electric fish. Structures near their tails 
called electric organs produce up to a volt of electricity,
about two-thirds as much as a AA battery. How does this work? The fish's brain sends a signal through
its nervous system to the electric organ, which is filled with stacks of hundreds or thousands of disc-shaped 
cells called electrocytes. Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium
and potassium ions to maintain a positive charge outside
and negative charge inside. But when the nerve signal arrives
at the electrocyte, it prompts the ion gates to open. Positively charged ions flow back in. Now, one face of the electrocyte
is negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. But the far side 
has the opposite charge pattern. These alternating charges 
can drive a current, turning the electrocyte 
into a biological battery. The key to these fish's powers 
is that nerve signals are coordinated to arrive at each cell 
at exactly the same time. That makes the stacks of electrocytes
act like thousands of batteries in series. The tiny charges from each one
add up to an electrical field that can travel several meters. Cells called electroreceptors
buried in the skin allow the fish to constantly sense
this field and the changes to it caused 
by the surroundings or other fish. The Peter’s elephantnose fish, 
for example, has an elongated chin
called a schnauzenorgan that's riddled in electroreceptors. That allows it to intercept signals
from other fish, judge distances, detect the shape and size
of nearby objects, and even determine whether
a buried insect is dead or alive. But the elephantnose
and other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity
to attack their prey. That ability belongs 
to the strongly electric fish, of which there are only 
a handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric
fish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span
almost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals
to navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest 
electric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out
and then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two 
or three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles,
sending it into spasms and generating waves 
that reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast, 
high-voltage discharges causes even more intense 
muscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up
so that the electric fields generated at each end 
of the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually
exhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel 
can swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish
are the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ 
that occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped
electric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world
of electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size 
of strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out 
of their bodies too quickly. Some scientists think that special 
proteins may shield the electric organs, but the truth is, this is one mystery 
science still hasn't illuminated.

and other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity
to attack their prey. That ability belongs 
to the strongly electric fish, of which there are only 
a handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric
fish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span
almost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals
to navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest 
electric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out
and then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two 
or three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles,
sending it into spasms and generating waves 
that reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast, 
high-voltage discharges causes even more intense 
muscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up
so that the electric fields generated at each end 
of the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually
exhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel 
can swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish
are the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ 
that occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped
electric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world
of electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size 
of strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out 
of their bodies too quickly. Some scientists think that special 
proteins may shield the electric organs, but the truth is, this is one mystery 
science still hasn't illuminated.

If a stranger needed help how long would it take you to offer them a hand? According to psychology the answer to that question may depend less on who you are as a person and more on how many people are with you at the time. In a strange paradox of human nature the more people there are in a group, the less likely anyone is to offer help. It's called the bystander effect, and it may be a roadblock that's keeping you from showing empathy When someone is in need people in large groups tend to feel that they don't need to do anything because someone else will take care of it. This is known as the diffusion of responsibility The end result is nobody does anything, and if you don't believe me I'll show you we started with a large group of 10 people and told them they were here today to see a product demonstration. So we're just basically looking for emotional reactions to certain products. We're not quite ready to go yet. So as you can see you have these surveys go ahead start filling them out take all the time you need with them. I am gonna go get the product and just Kinda start throwing it together, and then we're gonna begin sound good everyone? okay cool. Thanks Here's the thing though, everybody but one of these people wasn't in on it We gave her a 10-minute window where she could offer to help. Let's see if she comes to my rescue We repeated this a few more times with varying results. Next we tried it with a group of five. Oh geez So far it's not looking good for people in general Are we just plain unhelpful? Or is there something to the bystander effect. To find out let's see how helpful people are when they're all by themselves Hi The results with our group of 10 people: it took our participants an average of 8 minutes and 1 second before they lent a hand Can I help? I just feel bad Participants in our groups of 5 were a little quicker saving me from the tent with an average time of 7 minutes and 25 seconds Uh. Do you need help? Do you want to give me a hand? Yeah. That'd be great thank you. What can I do? But when our participants were by themselves that is when they really shined Thank you so much. On average They offered to step in in just 3 minutes and 19 seconds. You were the fastest by a country mile I have set this thing up by myself 7 times today completely you took a total of 12 seconds why why do you think you're so quick to do it? I like to help in any way that I can. that's the funny thing about the bystander effect You would think that a group with more people would mean there's a higher chance someone would do something But people in a group are actually less likely to help I knew I should have just stood up and done it But then a big part of you wanted to see what these people would do and I was just kind of like our than any Of them gonna help. At first I was a little shy to jump it in help, but then after I just you know I'm just gonna jump in and help. Thank you I appreciate it. You're welcome All right, took 8 minutes. When it's just the two of us in this space. There's like a bond that's created It's like I'm not gonna let you struggle on your own, and I think if there is a group of people It's way more acceptable for me to be doing that. it's the diffusion of responsibility I think that's totally true. if something is saying jump in and offer the help Just follow that intuition even though no one else is saying anything just hey if you can be a part of helping someone Instead of just watching the struggle or even take out your cell phone. You're like tape it or something like that which is the worst? Just offer some help So now that you know about the bystander effect ask yourself How often do you feel like you should help someone, but don't because you think somebody else will do it Maybe next time you will be that somebody

**Transcript**:
For some, it's a serious sport. For others, just a way to let loose. But despite its casual association
with fun and sun, surfing has a richer and deeper
history than many realize. What we today call surfing originated in the Polynesian islands 
of the Pacific Ocean. We know from various accounts that wave riding was done 
throughout the Polynesian Pacific, as well as in West Africa and Peru. But it was in the Hawaiian archipelago
in particular that surfing advanced the most, was best documented, and, unlike elsewhere in Polynesia,
persisted. And for the people of Hawaii, wave sliding was not 
just a recreational activity, but one with spiritual 
and social significance. Like much of Hawaiian society, nearly every aspect of surfing was
governed by a code of rules and taboos known as kapu. Hawaiians made offerings when selecting
a tree to carve, prayed for waves with the help
of a kahuna, or an expert priest, and gave thanks after surviving
a perilous wipeout. Certain surf breaks were strickly reserved
for the elite. But it wasn't just a solemn affair. Surfers competed and wagered
on who could ride the farthest, the fastest, or catch the biggest wave
with superior skill, granting respect, social status, and romantic success. Though it was later called
the sport of kings, Hawaiian men and women of all ages
and social classes participated, riding surfboards shaped from koa, breadfruit, or wiliwili trees. Many Hawaiians road alaia boards, which were thin, midsized,
and somewhat resemble today's shortboards. Some mounted paipo boards, short, round-nosed boards on which
riders typically lay on their stomachs. But only chieftains could ride
the massive olo boards, twice as long as today's longboards. Unlike most modern surfboards, all boards were finless, requiring surfers to drag their hands
or feet to turn. We don't know exactly when wave sliding
was invented, but we know that it had already
been practiced in Polynesia for centuries by the time it was described in 1777
by William Anderson, a surgeon on Captain Cook's ship
"Resolution." Although Anderson was in awe, most of the American Christian 
missionaries who arrived in Hawaii several decades later regarded surfing as sinful, and they discouraged it, along with
other aspects of native culture. The biggest threat to surfing, however,
was the threat to the natives themselves. By 1890, new illnesses introduced
by Europeans and Americans had decimated the Hawaiian people,
leaving fewer than 40,000 from a pre-contact population 
that may have exceeded 800,000. At the same time, foreign influence grew with white settlers overthrowing 
the native monarchy in 1893, and the U.S. annexing 
the islands five years later. The end of Hawaii's independence coincided
with surfing's native-led revival, a revival soon exploited
by the American colonizers. But first, some Hawaiians 
took surfing overseas. In 1907, George Freeth,
the so-called Hawaiian Wonder, traveled to the west coast and gave surfing demonstrations 
in southern California. Then in 1914, Olympic swimmer
Duke Kahanamoku made his way to Australia and New Zealand, gliding across the southern Pacific waves and attracting rapt audiences 
wherever he went. Shortly before Freeth went to California, a South Carolinian named 
Alexander Hume Ford moved to Hawaii. After learning to surf, he became 
a champion of the pastime. But Ford may have had unsavory reasons for his enthusiastic efforts 
to boost the sport. Like many settlers, he wanted Hawaii
to become a U.S. state but was worried about its non-white
majority of natives and Asian workers. Ford thus promoted surfing
to attract white Americans to Hawaii, first as tourists, then as residents. He was helped by numerous writers
and filmmakers. Ford's demographic plan 
would fail miserably. Hawaii became a state in 1959 and remains the most racially diverse 
state in the country. But the promotion of surfing
was a far greater success. Today, surfing is a multi-billion dollar
global industry, with tens of millions 
of enthusiasts worldwide. And though relatively few of these surfers
are aware of the once-crucial wave chants or board carving rituals, Hawaiians continue to preserve
these traditions nearly washed away by history's waves.

**Transcript**:
For some, it's a serious sport. For others, just a way to let loose. But despite its casual association
with fun and sun, surfing has a richer and deeper
history than many realize. What we today call surfing originated in the Polynesian islands 
of the Pacific Ocean. We know from various accounts that wave riding was done 
throughout the Polynesian Pacific, as well as in West Africa and Peru. But it was in the Hawaiian archipelago
in particular that surfing advanced the most, was best documented, and, unlike elsewhere in Polynesia,
persisted. And for the people of Hawaii, wave sliding was not 
just a recreational activity, but one with spiritual 
and social significance. Like much of Hawaiian society, nearly every aspect of surfing was
governed by a code of rules and taboos known as kapu. Hawaiians made offerings when selecting
a tree to carve, prayed for waves with the help
of a kahuna, or an expert priest, and gave thanks after surviving
a perilous wipeout. Certain surf breaks were strickly reserved
for the elite. But it wasn't just a solemn affair. Surfers competed and wagered
on who could ride the farthest, the fastest, or catch the biggest wave
with superior skill, granting respect, social status, and romantic success. Though it was later called
the sport of kings, Hawaiian men and women of all ages
and social classes participated, riding surfboards shaped from koa, breadfruit, or wiliwili trees. Many Hawaiians road alaia boards, which were thin, midsized,
and somewhat resemble today's shortboards. Some mounted paipo boards, short, round-nosed boards on which
riders typically lay on their stomachs. But only chieftains could ride
the massive olo boards, twice as long as today's longboards. Unlike most modern surfboards, all boards were finless, requiring surfers to drag their hands
or feet to turn. We don't know exactly when wave sliding
was invented, but we know that it had already
been practiced in Polynesia for centuries by the time it was described in 1777
by William Anderson, a surgeon on Captain Cook's ship
"Resolution." Although Anderson was in awe, most of the American Christian 
missionaries who arrived in Hawaii several decades later regarded surfing as sinful, and they discouraged it, along with
other aspects of native culture. The biggest threat to surfing, however,
was the threat to the natives themselves. By 1890, new illnesses introduced
by Europeans and Americans had decimated the Hawaiian people,
leaving fewer than 40,000 from a pre-contact population 
that may have exceeded 800,000. At the same time, foreign influence grew with white settlers overthrowing 
the native monarchy in 1893, and the U.S. annexing 
the islands five years later. The end of Hawaii's independence coincided
with surfing's native-led revival, a revival soon exploited
by the American colonizers. But first, some Hawaiians 
took surfing overseas. In 1907, George Freeth,
the so-called Hawaiian Wonder, traveled to the west coast and gave surfing demonstrations 
in southern California. Then in 1914, Olympic swimmer
Duke Kahanamoku made his way to Australia and New Zealand, gliding across the southern Pacific waves and attracting rapt audiences 
wherever he went. Shortly before Freeth went to California, a South Carolinian named 
Alexander Hume Ford moved to Hawaii. After learning to surf, he became 
a champion of the pastime. But Ford may have had unsavory reasons for his enthusiastic efforts 
to boost the sport. Like many settlers, he wanted Hawaii
to become a U.S. state but was worried about its non-white
majority of natives and Asian workers. Ford thus promoted surfing
to attract white Americans to Hawaii, first as tourists, then as residents. He was helped by numerous writers
and filmmakers. Ford's demographic plan 
would fail miserably. Hawaii became a state in 1959 and remains the most racially diverse 
state in the country. But the promotion of surfing
was a far greater success. Today, surfing is a multi-billion dollar
global industry, with tens of millions 
of enthusiasts worldwide. And though relatively few of these surfers
are aware of the once-crucial wave chants or board carving rituals, Hawaiians continue to preserve
these traditions nearly washed away by history's waves.

**Transcript**:
Before the creation of humanity, the Greek gods won a great battle against 
a race of giants called the Titans. Most Titans were destroyed or
driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,
whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus
to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating 
all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts
of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability 
to move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped
the first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed 
they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants 
of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient
creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude
creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide
how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick
that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it
into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed 
the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones
under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly
best portion for himself, he was outraged 
at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use
of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat 
or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see
his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus
to steal fire from the workshop 
of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk
and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness
nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care 
for themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons
and wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst
for the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,
he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again
wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained
to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture
who would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back
to be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained 
in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret 
at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression
made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous
and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,
and power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure
in art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's
lyrical drama "Prometheus Unbound," the author imagines Prometheus
as a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread
empathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, "Prometheus is the type 
of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest 
and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends." His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus
as a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel
"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus." This suggests the damage of corrupting
the natural order and remains relevant 
to the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our
capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimately, he reminds us of the potential 
of individual acts to ignite the world.

they were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants 
of Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient
creatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude
creations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide
how sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick
that would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it
into two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed 
the succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones
under a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly
best portion for himself, he was outraged 
at Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use
of fire on Earth, whether to cook meat 
or for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see
his creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus
to steal fire from the workshop 
of Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk
and brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness
nature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care 
for themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons
and wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst
for the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,
he realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again
wounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained
to a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture
who would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back
to be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained 
in perpetual agony, he never expressed regret 
at his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression
made him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous
and inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,
and power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure
in art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's
lyrical drama "Prometheus Unbound," the author imagines Prometheus
as a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread
empathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, "Prometheus is the type 
of the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest 
and the truest motives to the best and noblest ends." His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus
as a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel
"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus." This suggests the damage of corrupting
the natural order and remains relevant 
to the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today. As hero, rebel, or trickster, Prometheus remains a symbol of our
capacity to capture the powers of nature, and ultimately, he reminds us of the potential 
of individual acts to ignite the world.

driven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,
whose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus
to fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating 
all living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts
of the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability

**Transcript**:
There's a play so powerful 
that an old superstition says its name should never 
even be uttered in a theater, a play that begins with witchcraft
and ends with a bloody severed head, a play filled with riddles, prophesies,
nightmare visions, and lots of brutal murder, a play by William Shakespeare sometimes
referred to as the "Scottish Play" or the "Tragedy of Macbeth." First performed at the Globe Theater
in London in 1606, "Macbeth" is 
Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. It is also one of his most action-packed. In five acts, he recounts a story
of a Scottish nobleman who steals the throne, presides over a reign of terror, and then meets a bloody end. Along the way, it asks important questions
about ambition, power, and violence that spoke directly to the politics
of Shakespeare's time and continue to echo in our own. England in the early 17th century 
was politically precarious. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603
without producing an heir, and in a surprise move, her advisors passed the crown
to James Stewart, King of Scotland. Two years later, James was subject
to an assassination attempt called the Gunpowder Plot. Questions of what made 
for a legitimate king were on everyone's lips. So Shakespeare must have known
he had potent material when he conflated and adapted the stories of a murderous 11th century 
Scottish King named Macbeth and those of several 
other Scottish nobles. He found their annals
in Hollinshed's "Chronicles," a popular 16th century history
of Britain and Ireland. Shakespeare would also have known
he needed to tell his story in a way that would 
immediately grab the attention of his diverse and rowdy audience. The Globe welcomed 
all sections of society. Wealthier patrons watched the stage
from covered balconies while poorer people paid a penny
to take in the show from an open-air section called the pit. Talking, jeering, and cheering
was common during performances. There are even accounts of audiences
throwing furniture when plays were flops. So "Macbeth" opens with a literal bang. Thunder cracks and three witches appear. They announce they're searching for a Scottish nobleman 
and war hero named Macbeth, then fly off while chanting a curse
that predicts a world gone mad. "Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air." As seen later, they find Macbeth
and his fellow nobleman Banquo. "All hail Macbeth," they prophesize,
"that shalt be king hereafter!" "King?" Macbeth wonders. Just what would he have to do 
to gain the crown? Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth soon chart a course of murder, 
lies, and betrayal. In the ensuing bloodbath, Shakespeare provides viewers with some
of the most memorable passages in English literature. "Out, damned spot! Out, I say!"
Lady Macbeth cries when she believes she can't wipe her victim's blood 
off her hands. Her obsession with guilt is one
of many themes that runs through the play, along with the universal tendency
to abuse power, the endless cycles of violence 
and betrayal, the defying political conflict. As is typical with Shakespeare's language, a number of phrases 
that got their start in the play have been repeated so many times
that they now feel commonplace. They include "the milk of human kindness," "what's done is done," and the famous witches' spell, "Double, double toil and trouble; 
Fire burn, and caldron bubble." But Shakespeare saves the juiciest
bit of all for Macbeth himself. Towards the end of the play,
Macbeth reflects on the universality of death and the futility of life. "Out, out, brief candle!" he laments. "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts 
and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, 
full of sound and fury signifying nothing." Life may be a tale told my an idiot,
but "Macbeth" is not. Shakespeare's language and characters
have entered our cultural consciousness to a rare extent. Directors often use the story
to shed light on abuses of power, ranging from the American mafia to dictators across the globe. The play has been adapted 
to film many times, including Akira Kurosawa's 
"Throne of Blood," which takes place in feudal Japan, and a modernized version 
called "Scotland, PA," in which Macbeth and his rivals are managers of competing 
fast food restaurants. No matter the presentation, questions of morality, politics, and power are still relevant today, and so, it seems, 
is Shakespeare's "Macbeth."

**Transcript**:
There's a play so powerful 
that an old superstition says its name should never 
even be uttered in a theater, a play that begins with witchcraft
and ends with a bloody severed head, a play filled with riddles, prophesies,
nightmare visions, and lots of brutal murder, a play by William Shakespeare sometimes
referred to as the "Scottish Play" or the "Tragedy of Macbeth." First performed at the Globe Theater
in London in 1606, "Macbeth" is 
Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. It is also one of his most action-packed. In five acts, he recounts a story
of a Scottish nobleman who steals the throne, presides over a reign of terror, and then meets a bloody end. Along the way, it asks important questions
about ambition, power, and violence that spoke directly to the politics
of Shakespeare's time and continue to echo in our own. England in the early 17th century 
was politically precarious. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603
without producing an heir, and in a surprise move, her advisors passed the crown
to James Stewart, King of Scotland. Two years later, James was subject
to an assassination attempt called the Gunpowder Plot. Questions of what made 
for a legitimate king were on everyone's lips. So Shakespeare must have known
he had potent material when he conflated and adapted the stories of a murderous 11th century 
Scottish King named Macbeth and those of several 
other Scottish nobles. He found their annals
in Hollinshed's "Chronicles," a popular 16th century history
of Britain and Ireland. Shakespeare would also have known
he needed to tell his story in a way that would 
immediately grab the attention of his diverse and rowdy audience. The Globe welcomed 
all sections of society. Wealthier patrons watched the stage
from covered balconies while poorer people paid a penny
to take in the show from an open-air section called the pit. Talking, jeering, and cheering
was common during performances. There are even accounts of audiences
throwing furniture when plays were flops. So "Macbeth" opens with a literal bang. Thunder cracks and three witches appear. They announce they're searching for a Scottish nobleman 
and war hero named Macbeth, then fly off while chanting a curse
that predicts a world gone mad. "Fair is foul and foul is fair.
Hover through the fog and filthy air." As seen later, they find Macbeth
and his fellow nobleman Banquo. "All hail Macbeth," they prophesize,
"that shalt be king hereafter!" "King?" Macbeth wonders. Just what would he have to do 
to gain the crown? Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth soon chart a course of murder, 
lies, and betrayal. In the ensuing bloodbath, Shakespeare provides viewers with some
of the most memorable passages in English literature. "Out, damned spot! Out, I say!"
Lady Macbeth cries when she believes she can't wipe her victim's blood 
off her hands. Her obsession with guilt is one
of many themes that runs through the play, along with the universal tendency
to abuse power, the endless cycles of violence 
and betrayal, the defying political conflict. As is typical with Shakespeare's language, a number of phrases 
that got their start in the play have been repeated so many times
that they now feel commonplace. They include "the milk of human kindness," "what's done is done," and the famous witches' spell, "Double, double toil and trouble; 
Fire burn, and caldron bubble." But Shakespeare saves the juiciest
bit of all for Macbeth himself. Towards the end of the play,
Macbeth reflects on the universality of death and the futility of life. "Out, out, brief candle!" he laments. "Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts 
and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, 
full of sound and fury signifying nothing." Life may be a tale told my an idiot,
but "Macbeth" is not. Shakespeare's language and characters
have entered our cultural consciousness to a rare extent. Directors often use the story
to shed light on abuses of power, ranging from the American mafia to dictators across the globe. The play has been adapted 
to film many times, including Akira Kurosawa's 
"Throne of Blood," which takes place in feudal Japan, and a modernized version 
called "Scotland, PA," in which Macbeth and his rivals are managers of competing 
fast food restaurants. No matter the presentation, questions of morality, politics, and power are still relevant today, and so, it seems, 
is Shakespeare's "Macbeth."

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, the mathematician
Robert Recorde wrote a book called 
"The Whetstone of Witte" to teach English students algebra. But he was getting tired of writing
the words "is equal to" over and over. His solution? He replaced those words with
two parallel horizontal line segments because the way he saw it,
no two things can be more equal. Could he have used four line segments
instead of two? Of course. Could he have used vertical line segments? In fact, some people did. There's no reason why the equals sign
had to look the way it does today. At some point, it just caught on,
sort of like a meme. More and more mathematicians
began to use it, and eventually, 
it became a standard symbol for equality. Math is full of symbols. Lines, dots, arrows, English letters, Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts. It can look like an illegible jumble. It's normal to find this wealth
of symbols a little intimidating and to wonder where they all came from. Sometimes, as Recorde himself
noted about his equals sign, there's an apt conformity
between the symbol and what it represents. Another example of that 
is the plus sign for addition, which originated from a condensing
of the Latin word et meaning and. Sometimes, however, the choice of symbol
is more arbitrary, such as when a mathematician
named Christian Kramp introduced the exclamation mark
for factorials just because he needed a shorthand
for expressions like this. In fact, all of these symbols 
were invented or adopted by mathematicians who wanted
to avoid repeating themselves or having to use a lot of words
to write out mathematical ideas. Many of the symbols used
in mathematics are letters, usually from the Latin alphabet
or Greek. Characters are often found
representing quantities that are unknown, and the relationships between variables. They also stand in for specific numbers
that show up frequently but would be cumbersome or impossible
to fully write out in decimal form. Sets of numbers and whole equations
can be represented with letters, too. Other symbols are used 
to represent operations. Some of these are especially valuable
as shorthand because they condense repeated operations
into a single expression. The repeated addition of the same number
is abbreviated with a multiplication sign so it doesn't take up more space
than it has to. A number multiplied by itself
is indicated with an exponent that tells you how many times
to repeat the operation. And a long string of sequential terms
added together is collapsed into a capital sigma. These symbols shorten
lengthy calculations to smaller terms that are much easier to manipulate. Symbols can also provide 
succinct instructions about how to perform calculations. Consider the following set
of operations on a number. Take some number that you're thinking of, multiply it by two, subtract one from the result, multiply the result of that by itself, divide the result of that by three, and then add one to get the final output. Without our symbols and conventions,
we'd be faced with this block of text. With them, we have a compact,
elegant expression. Sometimes, as with equals, these symbols communicate meaning
through form. Many, however, are arbitrary. Understanding them is a matter
of memorizing what they mean and applying them in different contexts
until they stick, as with any language. If we were to encounter
an alien civilization, they'd probably have a totally
different set of symbols. But if they think anything like us,
they'd probably have symbols. And their symbols may even correspond
directly to ours. They'd have their own multiplication sign, symbol for pi, and, of course, equals.
