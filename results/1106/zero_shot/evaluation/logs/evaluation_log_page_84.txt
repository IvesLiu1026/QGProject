**Transcript**:
Arriving home after a long day, you settle
in for a quiet evening alone. But instead of the sound of silence, 
you hear a constant ringing— even though there’s nothing 
making any noise. What you’re experiencing 
is called tinnitus, the perception of a noise like ringing, 
buzzing, hissing or clicking that occurs without any external source 
of sound. Tinnitus has been bothering humanity 
since Ancient Babylon, plaguing everyone from Leonardo da Vinci 
to Charles Darwin. Today, roughly one in seven people 
worldwide experiences this auditory sensation. So where does this persistent sound 
come from? When you normally hear something, 
sound waves hit various areas of your ear, creating vibrations that displace fluid 
inside the cochlea. If the vibrations are large enough, they elicit a chemical response 
that transforms them into bioelectrical signals. These nerve impulses are then relayed 
through the hearing pathway to the brain, where they result 
in the sounds we perceive. However, in the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases, the nerve signals that produce 
these mysterious sounds don’t travel through your ear at all. Instead, they’re generated internally, 
by your own central nervous system. Under usual circumstances, 
these self-produced signals are an essential part of hearing. All mammals demonstrate 
on-going neural activity throughout their hearing pathways. When there are no sounds present, this activity is at a baseline 
that establishes your neural code for silence. When a sound does appear, 
this activity changes, allowing the brain to distinguish 
between silence and sound. But the auditory system’s health 
can affect this background signal. Loud noises, diseases, toxins, 
and even natural aging can damage your cochlear cells. Some of these may heal 
in a matter of hours. However, if enough cells die, 
either over time or all at once, the auditory system becomes 
less sensitive. With fewer cochlear cells 
relaying information, incoming sounds generate 
weaker nerve signals. And many environmental sounds 
can be lost completely. To compensate, your brain devotes more 
energy to monitoring the hearing pathway. Just like you might adjust 
the knobs of a radio, the brain modifies neural activity 
while also tweaking the tuning knob to get a clearer signal. Increasing this background neural activity
is intended to help you process weak auditory inputs. But it can also modify 
your baseline for silence— such that a lack of sound 
no longer sounds silent at all. This is called subjective tinnitus, and it accounts for the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases. Subjective tinnitus 
is a symptom associated with practically every known ear disorder, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. While its appearance can be surprising, subjective tinnitus has no inherently 
negative consequences. But for some, tinnitus episodes 
can trigger traumatic memories or otherwise distressing feelings, which increase the sound’s intrusiveness. This psychological loop often leads 
to what’s known as “bothersome tinnitus," a condition that can exacerbate 
the symptoms of PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. There’s no known cure 
for subjective tinnitus. So the most important thing 
doctors can do is help people understand 
this auditory event, and develop neutral associations 
with these often-distressing sounds. For example, sound therapy uses noises 
like rain, birdsong, or music to mask tinnitus and reduce stress. One form, called informational masking, 
uses soothing, complex auditory signals that distract the brain 
from the tinnitus sound. Another, called energetic masking, uses sounds with the same frequency 
as the patient’s tinnitus to occupy the neurons that would 
otherwise deliver the tinnitus signal. Practiced alongside counseling, these interventions allow 
people to re-evaluate their relationship with tinnitus. Losing the sound of silence 
can be troubling to say the least. Tinnitus reveals that your brain is 
constantly analyzing the world around you, even as it fails to filter 
its own internal noise. In a sense, experiencing tinnitus is like eavesdropping 
on your brain talking to itself— though it may not be a conversation 
you want to hear.

doctors can do is help people understand 
this auditory event, and develop neutral associations 
with these often-distressing sounds. For example, sound therapy uses noises 
like rain, birdsong, or music to mask tinnitus and reduce stress. One form, called informational masking, 
uses soothing, complex auditory signals that distract the brain 
from the tinnitus sound. Another, called energetic masking, uses sounds with the same frequency 
as the patient’s tinnitus to occupy the neurons that would 
otherwise deliver the tinnitus signal. Practiced alongside counseling, these interventions allow 
people to re-evaluate their relationship with tinnitus. Losing the sound of silence 
can be troubling to say the least. Tinnitus reveals that your brain is 
constantly analyzing the world around you, even as it fails to filter 
its own internal noise. In a sense, experiencing tinnitus is like eavesdropping 
on your brain talking to itself— though it may not be a conversation 
you want to hear.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You’re the chief advisor 
to an eccentric king who needs to declare his successor. He wants his heir to be good 
at arithmetic, lucky, and above all else, honest. So he’s devised a competition 
to test his children, and ordered you to choose the winner. Each potential heir will be given 
the same two six-sided dice. The red die has the numbers 
2, 7, 7, 12, 12, and 17. The blue one has 
3, 8, 8, 13, 13, and 18. The dice are fair, so each side 
is equally likely to come up. Each contestant will be sent 
into a Royal Rolling Room, where they’ll roll both dice 
20 times. A contestant’s score starts at zero, 
and each turn, they should add the total 
of the two numbers rolled to their score. After 20 turns, they should report 
their final score. The rooms are secure, 
and no one observes the rolls. That means a contestant could 
add incorrectly, or worse, be dishonest and make up a score they didn’t achieve. This is where you come in. The king has instructed you that 
if you’re at least 90% sure a contestant mis-added or cheated, 
you should disqualify them. The highest-scoring player who remains 
will be the new heir to the throne. After you explain the rules, 
the children run to their rooms. When they return, 
Alexa announces her score is 385. Bertram says 840. Cassandra reports 700. 
And Draco declares 423. The future of the kingdom 
is in your hands. Whom do you proclaim 
to be the worthiest successor? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Upon inspection, 
most of these scores are concerning. Let’s start with the highest. Bertram scored 840. That’s impressive… 
but is it even possible? The highest numbers on the two dice 
are 17 and 18. 17 plus 18 is 35, so in 20 rolls, the greatest possible total 
is 20 times 35, or 700. Even if Bertram rolled 
all the highest numbers, he couldn’t have scored 840. So he’s disqualified. Cassandra, the next-highest roller, 
reported 700. That’s theoretically possible… 
but how hard is it to be that lucky? In order to get 700, Cassandra would have to roll 
the highest number out of six on 40 separate occasions. The probability of this is 1 over 6 
to the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion— 
that’s 13 followed by 30 zeros. To put that in perspective, there are 
about 7.5 billion people in the world, and 7.5 billion squared 
is a lot less than 13 nonillion. Rolling the highest number 
all 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random 
person on Earth, and it turned out 
to be actor Paul Rudd… and then you randomly picked again, 
and got Paul Rudd again! You can’t be 100% sure that Cassandra’s 
score didn’t happen by chance… but you can certainly be 90% sure, 
so she should be disqualified. Next up is Draco, with 423. This score isn’t high enough 
to be suspicious. But it’s impossible 
for a different reason. Pick a number from each die, 
and add them up. No matter which combination you choose, 
the result ends in a 0 or a 5. That’s because every red number 
is 2 more than a multiple of 5, and every blue number 
is 3 more than a multiple of 5. This means that when you add 
them together, you’ll always get an exact multiple of 5. And when you add rolls 
that are multiples of 5, the result will also be a multiple of 5. These sorts of relationships 
between integers are studied in a branch of math called number theory. Here number theory shows 
us that Draco’s score, which is not a multiple of 5,
cannot be achieved. So he should be disqualified as well. This leaves Alexa, 
whose score is a multiple of 5 and is in the achievable range. In fact, the most likely score is 400, 
so she was a little bit unlucky. But with everyone else disqualified, 
she’s the last heir standing. All hail Queen Alexa, 
the worthiest successor! At least if you agree that the best way 
to organize your government is a roll of the dice...

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

the highest number out of six on 40 separate occasions. The probability of this is 1 over 6 
to the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion— 
that’s 13 followed by 30 zeros. To put that in perspective, there are 
about 7.5 billion people in the world, and 7.5 billion squared 
is a lot less than 13 nonillion. Rolling the highest number 
all 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random 
person on Earth, and it turned out 
to be actor Paul Rudd… and then you randomly picked again, 
and got Paul Rudd again! You can’t be 100% sure that Cassandra’s 
score didn’t happen by chance… but you can certainly be 90% sure, 
so she should be disqualified. Next up is Draco, with 423. This score isn’t high enough 
to be suspicious. But it’s impossible 
for a different reason. Pick a number from each die, 
and add them up. No matter which combination you choose, 
the result ends in a 0 or a 5. That’s because every red number 
is 2 more than a multiple of 5, and every blue number 
is 3 more than a multiple of 5. This means that when you add 
them together, you’ll always get an exact multiple of 5. And when you add rolls 
that are multiples of 5, the result will also be a multiple of 5. These sorts of relationships 
between integers are studied in a branch of math called number theory. Here number theory shows 
us that Draco’s score, which is not a multiple of 5,
cannot be achieved. So he should be disqualified as well. This leaves Alexa, 
whose score is a multiple of 5 and is in the achievable range. In fact, the most likely score is 400, 
so she was a little bit unlucky. But with everyone else disqualified, 
she’s the last heir standing. All hail Queen Alexa, 
the worthiest successor! At least if you agree that the best way 
to organize your government is a roll of the dice...

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a way to create a similar MCQ.

To match the ground truth MCQ, a generated MCQ should have the following characteristics:

* Question intent: The question should ask to determine the winner of the competition based on the given scores.
* Options: The options should include the scores, and the correct answer should be the score that is a multiple of 5 and within the achievable range.

Considering these characteristics, a similar generated MCQ could be:

Question: Which of the following scores should be declared the winner?
Options: A. 365, B. 400, C. 423, D. 720

However, since this MCQ is not present in the generated MCQs, I cannot provide an index.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 10 is the closest in terms of content, as it asks about the worthiest successor. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

Index: Not available (or 10, if considering a loose match)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You’re the chief advisor 
to an eccentric king who needs to declare his successor. He wants his heir to be good 
at arithmetic, lucky, and above all else, honest. So he’s devised a competition 
to test his children, and ordered you to choose the winner. Each potential heir will be given 
the same two six-sided dice. The red die has the numbers 
2, 7, 7, 12, 12, and 17. The blue one has 
3, 8, 8, 13, 13, and 18. The dice are fair, so each side 
is equally likely to come up. Each contestant will be sent 
into a Royal Rolling Room, where they’ll roll both dice 
20 times. A contestant’s score starts at zero, 
and each turn, they should add the total 
of the two numbers rolled to their score. After 20 turns, they should report 
their final score. The rooms are secure, 
and no one observes the rolls. That means a contestant could 
add incorrectly, or worse, be dishonest and make up a score they didn’t achieve. This is where you come in. The king has instructed you that 
if you’re at least 90% sure a contestant mis-added or cheated, 
you should disqualify them. The highest-scoring player who remains 
will be the new heir to the throne. After you explain the rules, 
the children run to their rooms. When they return, 
Alexa announces her score is 385. Bertram says 840. Cassandra reports 700. 
And Draco declares 423. The future of the kingdom 
is in your hands. Whom do you proclaim 
to be the worthiest successor? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Upon inspection, 
most of these scores are concerning. Let’s start with the highest. Bertram scored 840. That’s impressive… 
but is it even possible? The highest numbers on the two dice 
are 17 and 18. 17 plus 18 is 35, so in 20 rolls, the greatest possible total 
is 20 times 35, or 700. Even if Bertram rolled 
all the highest numbers, he couldn’t have scored 840. So he’s disqualified. Cassandra, the next-highest roller, 
reported 700. That’s theoretically possible… 
but how hard is it to be that lucky? In order to get 700, Cassandra would have to roll 
the highest number out of six on 40 separate occasions. The probability of this is 1 over 6 
to the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion— 
that’s 13 followed by 30 zeros. To put that in perspective, there are 
about 7.5 billion people in the world, and 7.5 billion squared 
is a lot less than 13 nonillion. Rolling the highest number 
all 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random 
person on Earth, and it turned out 
to be actor Paul Rudd… and then you randomly picked again, 
and got Paul Rudd again! You can’t be 100% sure that Cassandra’s 
score didn’t happen by chance… but you can certainly be 90% sure, 
so she should be disqualified. Next up is Draco, with 423. This score isn’t high enough 
to be suspicious. But it’s impossible

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a different scenario with new dice and scores, whereas the generated MCQs are all related to the original scenario.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 4: "What is the maximum possible score a contestant can achieve in 20 rolls?" is the closest match.

This question is related to the concept of calculating the maximum possible score, which is also relevant to the ground truth MCQ. However, the context and options are different, so it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Oh the humanity! Ah... humanity... It’s a trainwreck,
but I can’t look away. It’s 1843, and a debate is raging 
among physicians about one of the most common 
killers of women: childbed fever. Childbed fever strikes 
within days of giving birth, killing more than 70% of those infected—
and nobody knows what causes it. Obstetrician Charles Meigs has a theory. Having observed abdominal inflammation in patients who go on 
to develop the fever, he claims this inflammation 
is the cause of childbed fever. Much of the medical establishment
supports his theory. Oh, come on! They really leave me no choice 
but to teach them some skepticism. That’s better. Now, Meigs, your argument is based 
on a fallacy— the false cause fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation: When two phenomena regularly occur
together, one does not necessarily 
cause the other. So you say women who have inflammation
also come down with childbed fever, therefore the inflammation 
caused the fever. But that’s not necessarily true. Yes, yes, the inflammation comes first,
then the fever, so it seems like the inflammation 
causes the fever. But by that logic, since babies 
usually grow hair before teeth, hair growth must cause tooth growth. And we all know that’s not true,
right? Actually, don’t answer that. A couple of different things 
could be going on here. First, it’s possible that fever 
and inflammation are correlated purely by coincidence. Or, there could be a causal relationship
that’s the opposite of what you think— the fever causes the inflammation, rather than the inflammation 
causing the fever. Or both could share a common 
underlying cause you haven’t thought of. If I may, just what do you think 
causes inflammation? Nothing? It just is? Really? Humor me for a moment in discussing
one of your colleague’s ideas— Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. I know, I know, 
you don’t like his theory— you already wrote 
a scathing letter about it. But let’s fill your students in, shall we? Holmes noticed a pattern: 
when a patient dies of childbed fever, a doctor performs an autopsy. If the doctor then treats a new patient, that patient often comes 
down with the fever. Based on this correlation between autopsies of fever victims
and new fever patients, he proposes a possible cause. Since there’s no evidence that the autopsy
causes the fever beyond this correlation, he doesn’t jump to the conclusion 
that autopsy causes fever. Instead, he suggests that doctors 
are infecting their patients via an invisible contaminant 
on their hands and surgical instruments. This idea outrages most doctors, 
who see themselves as infallible. Like Meigs here, who refuses 
to consider the possibility that he’s playing a role 
in his patients’ plight. His flawed argument doesn’t leave any 
path forward for further investigation— but Holmes’ does. It’s 1847, and physician Ignaz Semmelweis has reduced the number 
of childbed fever deaths in a clinic from 12% to 1% 
by requiring all medical personnel to disinfect their hands after autopsies
and between patient examinations. With this initiative, he has proven
the contagious nature of childbed fever. Ha! It’s 1879, and Louis Pasteur 
has identified the contaminant responsible 
for many cases of childbed fever: Hemolytic streptococcus bacteria. Hmm, my fries are cold. Must be because my ice cream melted.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Oh the humanity! Ah... humanity... It’s a trainwreck,
but I can’t look away. It’s 1843, and a debate is raging 
among physicians about one of the most common 
killers of women: childbed fever. Childbed fever strikes 
within days of giving birth, killing more than 70% of those infected—
and nobody knows what causes it. Obstetrician Charles Meigs has a theory. Having observed abdominal inflammation in patients who go on 
to develop the fever, he claims this inflammation 
is the cause of childbed fever. Much of the medical establishment
supports his theory. Oh, come on! They really leave me no choice 
but to teach them some skepticism. That’s better. Now, Meigs, your argument is based 
on a fallacy— the false cause fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation: When two phenomena regularly occur
together, one does not necessarily 
cause the other. So you say women who have inflammation
also come down with childbed fever, therefore the inflammation 
caused the fever. But that’s not necessarily true. Yes, yes, the inflammation comes first,
then the fever, so it seems like the inflammation 
causes the fever. But by that logic, since babies 
usually grow hair before teeth, hair growth must cause tooth growth. And we all know that’s not true,
right? Actually, don’t answer that. A couple of different things 
could be going on here. First, it’s possible that fever 
and inflammation are correlated purely by coincidence. Or, there could be a causal relationship
that’s the opposite of what you think— the fever causes the inflammation, rather than the inflammation 
causing the fever. Or both could share a common 
underlying cause you haven’t thought of. If I may, just what do you think 
causes inflammation? Nothing? It just is? Really? Humor me for a moment in discussing
one of your colleague’s ideas— Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. I know, I know, 
you don’t like his theory— you already wrote 
a scathing letter about it. But let’s fill your students in, shall we? Holmes noticed a pattern: 
when a patient dies of childbed fever, a doctor performs an autopsy. If the doctor then treats a new patient, that patient often comes 
down with the fever. Based on this correlation between autopsies of fever victims
and new fever patients, he proposes a possible cause. Since there’s no evidence that the autopsy
causes the fever beyond this correlation, he doesn’t jump to the conclusion 
that autopsy causes fever. Instead, he suggests that doctors 
are infecting their patients via an invisible contaminant 
on their hands and surgical instruments. This idea outrages most doctors, 
who see themselves as infallible. Like Meigs here, who refuses 
to consider the possibility that he’s playing a role 
in his patients’ plight. His flawed argument doesn’t leave any 
path forward for further investigation— but Holmes’ does. It’s 1847, and physician Ignaz Semmelweis has reduced the number

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7, but it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 6 is not a good match because the ground truth MCQ asks about reducing childbed fever deaths, not proposing a theory.

A better match would be a question that asks about the person credited with reducing childbed fever deaths and has options that include the names of physicians mentioned in the transcript.

However, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match in terms of content, but it asks about the initiative implemented by Ignaz Semmelweis, not the person credited with reducing childbed fever deaths.

If I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest match, but a more accurate match would be a question that combines elements of Questions 6 and 7.

**Transcript**:
From Ancient Greece to the 20th century, Aristotle, Sigmund Freud,
and numerous other scholars were all looking for the same thing: eel testicles. Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,
could be found in rivers across Europe, but no one had ever seen them mate. And despite countless dissections, no researcher could find eel eggs
or identify their reproductive organs. Devoid of data, naturalists proposed 
various eel origin stories. Aristotle suggested that eels 
spontaneously emerged from mud. Pliny the Elder argued eels 
rubbed themselves against rocks, and the subsequent scrapings 
came to life. Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,
manifest from the gills of other fish, and even emerge 
from the bodies of beetles. But the true story of eel reproduction
is even more difficult to imagine. And to solve this slippery mystery, scholars would have to rethink 
centuries of research. Today, we know the freshwater eel 
lifecycle has five distinct stages: larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,
adolescent elvers, older yellow eels, and adult silver eels. Given the radical physical differences 
between these phases, you’d be forgiven for assuming 
these are different animals. In fact, that’s exactly what 
European naturalists thought. Researchers were aware of leptocepheli
and glass eels, but no one guessed they were related
to the elvers and yellow eels living hundreds of kilometers upstream. Confusing matters more, eels don’t 
develop sex organs until late in life. And the entirety of their time 
in the rivers of Europe is essentially eel adolescence. So when do eels reproduce, 
and where do they do it? Despite its name, the life 
of a freshwater eel actually begins in the salty waters 
of the Bermuda Triangle. At the height of the annual 
cyclone season, thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae drift out of the Sargasso Sea. From here, they follow migration 
paths to North America and Europe— continents that were 
much closer when eels established these routes 
40 million years ago. Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla
larvae ride the ocean currents 6,500 km to the coast of Europe— making one of the longest 
known marine migrations. By the time they arrive, they’ve grown 
approximately 45 mm, and transformed into semi-transparent 
glass eels. It’s not just their appearance 
that’s changed. If most marine fish entered 
brackish coastal waters, their cells would swell with freshwater
in a lethal explosion. But when glass eels reach the coast, their kidneys shift to retain more salt and maintain their blood’s 
salinity levels. Swarms of these newly freshwater 
fish migrate up streams and rivers, sometimes piling on top of each other
to clear obstacles and predators. Those that make it upstream develop
into opaque elvers. Having finally arrived 
in their hunting grounds, elvers begin to eat everything 
they can fit into their mouths. These omnivores grow in proportion
to their diets, and over the next decade they develop
into larger yellow eels. In this stage, they grow 
to be roughly 80 cm, and finally develop sexual organs. But the last phase of eel life— 
and the secret of their reproduction— remains mysterious. In 1896, researchers identified 
leptocepheli as larval eels, and deduced that they had come 
to Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic. However, to find this mysterious 
breeding ground, someone would have to perform 
an unthinkable survey of the ocean for larvae no larger than 30mm. Enter Johannes Schmidt. For the next 18 years, 
this Danish oceanographer trawled the coasts of four continents, hunting down increasingly 
tiny leptocepheli. Finally, in 1921, he found 
the smallest larvae yet, on the southern edge 
of the Sargasso Sea. Despite knowledge 
of their round trip migration, scientists still haven’t observed 
mating in the wild, or found a single eel egg. Leading theories suggest 
that eels reproduce in a flurry of external fertilization, in which clouds of sperm 
fertilize free-floating eggs. But the powerful currents 
and tangling seaweed of the Sargasso Sea have made this theory 
difficult to confirm. Researchers don’t even know where to look, since they’ve yet to successfully
track an eel over the course of its return migration. Until these challenges can be met, the eel’s ancient secret will continue
to slip through our fingers.

**Transcript**:
From Ancient Greece to the 20th century, Aristotle, Sigmund Freud,
and numerous other scholars were all looking for the same thing: eel testicles. Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,
could be found in rivers across Europe, but no one had ever seen them mate. And despite countless dissections, no researcher could find eel eggs
or identify their reproductive organs. Devoid of data, naturalists proposed 
various eel origin stories. Aristotle suggested that eels 
spontaneously emerged from mud. Pliny the Elder argued eels 
rubbed themselves against rocks, and the subsequent scrapings 
came to life. Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,
manifest from the gills of other fish, and even emerge 
from the bodies of beetles. But the true story of eel reproduction
is even more difficult to imagine. And to solve this slippery mystery, scholars would have to rethink 
centuries of research. Today, we know the freshwater eel 
lifecycle has five distinct stages: larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,
adolescent elvers, older yellow eels, and adult silver eels. Given the radical physical differences 
between these phases, you’d be forgiven for assuming 
these are different animals. In fact, that’s exactly what 
European naturalists thought. Researchers were aware of leptocepheli
and glass eels, but no one guessed they were related
to the elvers and yellow eels living hundreds of kilometers upstream. Confusing matters more, eels don’t 
develop sex organs until late in life. And the entirety of their time 
in the rivers of Europe is essentially eel adolescence. So when do eels reproduce, 
and where do they do it? Despite its name, the life 
of a freshwater eel actually begins in the salty waters 
of the Bermuda Triangle. At the height of the annual 
cyclone season, thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae drift out of the Sargasso Sea. From here, they follow migration 
paths to North America and Europe— continents that were 
much closer when eels established these routes 
40 million years ago. Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla
larvae ride the ocean currents 6,500 km to the coast of Europe— making one of the longest 
known marine migrations. By the time they arrive, they’ve grown 
approximately 45 mm, and transformed into semi-transparent 
glass eels. It’s not just their appearance 
that’s changed. If most marine fish entered 
brackish coastal waters, their cells would swell with freshwater
in a lethal explosion. But when glass eels reach the coast, their kidneys shift to retain more salt and maintain their blood’s 
salinity levels. Swarms of these newly freshwater 
fish migrate up streams and rivers, sometimes piling on top of each other
to clear obstacles and predators. Those that make it upstream develop
into opaque elvers. Having finally arrived 
in their hunting grounds, elvers begin to eat everything 
they can fit into their mouths. These omnivores grow in proportion
to their diets, and over the next decade they develop
into larger yellow eels. In this stage, they grow 
to be roughly 80 cm, and finally develop sexual organs. But the last phase of eel life— 
and the secret of their reproduction— remains mysterious. In 1896, researchers identified 
leptocepheli as larval eels, and deduced that they had come 
to Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic. However, to find this mysterious 
breeding ground, someone would have to perform 
an unthinkable survey of the ocean for larvae no larger than 30mm. Enter Johannes Schmidt. For the next 18 years, 
this Danish oceanographer trawled the coasts of four continents, hunting down increasingly 
tiny leptocepheli. Finally, in 1921, he found 
the smallest larvae yet, on the southern edge 
of the Sargasso Sea. Despite knowledge 
of their round trip migration, scientists still haven’t observed 
mating in the wild, or found a single eel egg. Leading theories suggest 
that eels reproduce in a flurry of external fertilization, in which clouds of sperm 
fertilize free-floating eggs. But the powerful currents 
and tangling seaweed of the Sargasso Sea have made this theory 
difficult to confirm. Researchers don’t even know where to look, since they’ve yet to successfully
track an eel over the course of its return migration. Until these challenges can be met, the eel’s ancient secret will continue
to slip through our fingers.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7: "At what stage of their lifecycle do eels finally develop sexual organs?" is related to the lifecycle stage mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. However, a closer match is not available.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be: "What type of diet do elvers have?" But this question is not present in the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar, although it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
In the center of Colchis 
in an enchanted garden, the hide of a mystical flying ram 
hung from the tallest oak, guarded by a dragon who never slept. Jason would have to tread carefully 
to pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches and win back his promised throne. But diplomacy was hardly 
one of the Argonauts’ strengths. Jason would have to navigate 
this difficult task alone. Or so he thought. Leaving most of his bedraggled crew 
to rest, Jason made for the palace with some 
of his more even-tempered men. His first instinct was to simply ask 
the king for his prized possession. But Aeetes was enraged 
at the hero’s presumption. If this outsider wanted his treasure, he would have to prove his worth 
by facing three perilous tasks. The trials would begin the following day, 
and Jason was dismissed to prepare. But another member of the royal family 
was also plotting something. Thanks to the encouragement 
of Jason’s guardians on Mount Olympus, Medea, princess of Colchis 
and priestess of the witch goddess Hecate, had fallen in love with the challenger. She intended to protect her beloved 
from her father’s tricks — at any cost. After a sleepless night, Jason 
somberly marched to the castle— but was intercepted. The princess armed him 
with strange vials and trinkets, in exchange for a promise 
of eternal devotion. As they whispered 
and planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply 
under each other’s spell. Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason 
to face his first task. The hero was brought 
to a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land 
around the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted 
a fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields 
unscathed. For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth 
to plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed
sprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, 
barricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him 
for this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him 
into their midst, the fighters turned on themselves 
as they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray. For the third task, Jason was finally face to face 
with the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree 
and sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations 
reached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, 
the dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed 
to the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece 
off its branch. When the king saw the hero 
sprinting away— not only with the fleece, 
but his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army 
led by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize 
and his conniving daughter home. But all the players in this tale 
had underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran 
his sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces 
of the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father 
while the Argonauts escaped. As Colchis and their pursuers 
grew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return 
to Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act 
had tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them. Buffeted by hostile winds, the wretched crew washed up 
on the island of Circe the sorceress. Medea begged her aunt 
to absolve them of wrongdoing— but bloody deeds 
are not so easily forgotten, and fallen heroes 
not so rapidly redeemed.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Medea's role as a priestess of a specific goddess. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 mentions Medea as the princess of Colchis who helped Jason complete the three perilous tasks.

Although Question 4 does not specifically ask about Medea's role as a priestess, it does mention her as the princess of Colchis, which is a key aspect of the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is still not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
In the center of Colchis 
in an enchanted garden, the hide of a mystical flying ram 
hung from the tallest oak, guarded by a dragon who never slept. Jason would have to tread carefully 
to pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches and win back his promised throne. But diplomacy was hardly 
one of the Argonauts’ strengths. Jason would have to navigate 
this difficult task alone. Or so he thought. Leaving most of his bedraggled crew 
to rest, Jason made for the palace with some 
of his more even-tempered men. His first instinct was to simply ask 
the king for his prized possession. But Aeetes was enraged 
at the hero’s presumption. If this outsider wanted his treasure, he would have to prove his worth 
by facing three perilous tasks. The trials would begin the following day, 
and Jason was dismissed to prepare. But another member of the royal family 
was also plotting something. Thanks to the encouragement 
of Jason’s guardians on Mount Olympus, Medea, princess of Colchis 
and priestess of the witch goddess Hecate, had fallen in love with the challenger. She intended to protect her beloved 
from her father’s tricks — at any cost. After a sleepless night, Jason 
somberly marched to the castle— but was intercepted. The princess armed him 
with strange vials and trinkets, in exchange for a promise 
of eternal devotion. As they whispered 
and planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply 
under each other’s spell. Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason 
to face his first task. The hero was brought 
to a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land 
around the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted 
a fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields 
unscathed. For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth 
to plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed
sprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, 
barricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him 
for this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him 
into their midst, the fighters turned on themselves 
as they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray. For the third task, Jason was finally face to face 
with the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree 
and sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations 
reached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, 
the dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed 
to the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece 
off its branch. When the king saw the hero 
sprinting away— not only with the fleece, 
but his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army 
led by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize 
and his conniving daughter home. But all the players in this tale 
had underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran 
his sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces 
of the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father 
while the Argonauts escaped. As Colchis and their pursuers 
grew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return 
to Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act 
had tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them. Buffeted by hostile winds, the wretched crew washed up 
on the island of Circe the sorceress. Medea begged her aunt 
to absolve them of wrongdoing— but bloody deeds 
are not so easily forgotten, and fallen heroes 
not so rapidly redeemed.

**Transcript**:
One summer evening in 335 BCE, 
Alexander the Great was resting by the Danube River after 
a day of fighting the Scythian tribes when a band of strangers 
approached his camp. Alexander had never seen anything 
like these tall, fierce-looking warriors with huge 
golden neck rings and colorful cloaks— so he invited them to feast with him. They proudly said they were Keltoi 
or Celts who came from the far-away Alps. Alexander asked what they feared 
the most in the world, hoping they would say him. They laughed and said they feared 
nothing at all. This is one of the earliest stories 
about the ancient Celts. While we don’t know 
where the first Celts came from, by Alexander’s time 
they had spread across Europe from Asia Minor in the east to Spain and the Atlantic islands of Britain 
and Ireland in the west. The Celts were never one unified empire,
and they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent
tribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king 
and religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought 
their enemies. Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, 
the Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth 
to live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed 
to their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, 
scoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior
could possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads 
in jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests 
who visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued 
in the ancient world that foreign kings often hired 
them as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies. But the Celts were much more 
than just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen,
artists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds 
of their ancestors and praised the accomplishments
of warrior kings— and composed biting satires 
about cowardly or selfish leaders. The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids 
oversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years 
of study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record
any of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices 
and sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, 
judges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could
step between warring tribes in the middle of a battle 
and call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid,
or question their decisions. In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans 
began to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman 
legions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained 
their tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar 
marched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies 
to turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite 
against their common enemy under the leadership 
of king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families 
died or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France. Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland
were the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe 
in a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving 
the Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle 
against the enemy. By the end of the 1st century CE, 
Ireland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts 
survived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses the structure or organization of the Celtic people.

While there isn't a direct match, Question 5 is the closest in terms of discussing the roles within Celtic society, which implies a certain level of organization or structure.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is about the organization of the Celtic people, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose, I would say Question 5 is the closest.

But since Question 5 doesn't discuss the organization of the Celtic people as a whole, I would say that there isn't a direct match.

**Transcript**:
One summer evening in 335 BCE, 
Alexander the Great was resting by the Danube River after 
a day of fighting the Scythian tribes when a band of strangers 
approached his camp. Alexander had never seen anything 
like these tall, fierce-looking warriors with huge 
golden neck rings and colorful cloaks— so he invited them to feast with him. They proudly said they were Keltoi 
or Celts who came from the far-away Alps. Alexander asked what they feared 
the most in the world, hoping they would say him. They laughed and said they feared 
nothing at all. This is one of the earliest stories 
about the ancient Celts. While we don’t know 
where the first Celts came from, by Alexander’s time 
they had spread across Europe from Asia Minor in the east to Spain and the Atlantic islands of Britain 
and Ireland in the west. The Celts were never one unified empire,
and they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent
tribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king 
and religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought 
their enemies. Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, 
the Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth 
to live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed 
to their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, 
scoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior
could possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads 
in jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests 
who visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued 
in the ancient world that foreign kings often hired 
them as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies. But the Celts were much more 
than just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen,
artists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds 
of their ancestors and praised the accomplishments
of warrior kings— and composed biting satires 
about cowardly or selfish leaders. The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids 
oversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years 
of study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record
any of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices 
and sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, 
judges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could
step between warring tribes in the middle of a battle 
and call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid,
or question their decisions. In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans 
began to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman 
legions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained 
their tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar 
marched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies 
to turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite 
against their common enemy under the leadership 
of king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families 
died or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France. Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland
were the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe 
in a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving 
the Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle 
against the enemy. By the end of the 1st century CE, 
Ireland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts 
survived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins.

**Transcript**:
It was a feast like Egypt 
had never seen before. The warrior god Set and his wife, 
the goddess Nephtys, decorated an extravagant hall 
for the occasion, with a beautiful wooden chest 
as the centerpiece. They invited all the most important gods,
dozens of lesser deities, and foreign monarchs. But no one caused as big a stir as Set 
and Nephtys’s older brother Osiris, the god who ruled all of Egypt 
and had brought prosperity to everyone. Set announced a game— whoever could fit perfectly in the chest
could have it as a gift. One by one, the guests clambered in,
but no one fit. Finally, it was Osiris’s turn. As he lay down, everyone could see
it was a perfect fit— another win for the god 
who could do no wrong. Then Set slammed the lid down 
with Osiris still inside, sealed it shut, and tossed it into the Nile. The chest was a coffin. Set had constructed it specifically 
to trap his brother and planned the party to lure him into it. Set had long been jealous 
of his brother’s successful reign, and hoped to replace 
him as the ruler of all Egypt. The Nile bore the coffin out to sea 
and it drifted for many days before washing ashore near Byblos, 
where a great cedar grew around it. The essence of the god within 
gave the tree a divine aura, and when the king of Byblos noticed it, he ordered the tree cut down
and brought to his palace. Unbeknownst to him, the coffin containing Egypt’s 
most powerful god was still inside. Set’s victory seemed complete, 
but he hadn’t counted on his sisters. Set’s wife Nephtys was also his sister, while their other sister, 
the goddess Isis, was married to their brother Osiris. Isis was determined to find Osiris, and enlisted Nephtys’s help 
behind Set’s back. The two sisters took the shape 
of falcons and travelled far and wide. Some children who had seen 
the coffin float by pointed them to the palace of Byblos. Isis adopted a new disguise 
and approached the palace. The queen was so charmed 
by the disguised goddess that she entrusted her 
with nursing the baby prince. Isis decided to make the child immortal 
by bathing him in flame. When the horrified queen 
came upon this scene, Isis revealed herself 
and demanded the tree. When she cut the coffin from the trunk
and opened it, Osiris was dead inside. Weeping, she carried his body 
back to Egypt and hid it in a swamp, while she set off in search 
of a means of resurrecting him. But while she was gone, Set found the body 
and cut it into many pieces, scattering them throughout Egypt. Isis had lost Osiris for the second time,
but she did not give up. She searched all over the land,
traveling in a boat of papyrus. One by one, she tracked down 
the parts of her husband’s dismembered body
in every province of Egypt, holding a funeral for each piece. At long last, she had recovered
every piece but one— his penis, 
which a fish in the Nile had eaten. Working with what she had, Isis 
reconstructed and revived her husband. But without his penis, 
Osiris was incomplete. He could not remain among the living, could not return to his old position 
as ruler of Egypt. Instead, he would have to rule over Duat,
the realm of the dead. Before he went, though, he and Isis 
conceived a son to bear Osiris’s legacy— and one day, avenge him.

of a means of resurrecting him. But while she was gone, Set found the body 
and cut it into many pieces, scattering them throughout Egypt. Isis had lost Osiris for the second time,
but she did not give up. She searched all over the land,
traveling in a boat of papyrus. One by one, she tracked down 
the parts of her husband’s dismembered body
in every province of Egypt, holding a funeral for each piece. At long last, she had recovered
every piece but one— his penis, 
which a fish in the Nile had eaten. Working with what she had, Isis 
reconstructed and revived her husband. But without his penis, 
Osiris was incomplete. He could not remain among the living, could not return to his old position 
as ruler of Egypt. Instead, he would have to rule over Duat,
the realm of the dead. Before he went, though, he and Isis 
conceived a son to bear Osiris’s legacy— and one day, avenge him.

**Transcript**:
It was a feast like Egypt 
had never seen before. The warrior god Set and his wife, 
the goddess Nephtys, decorated an extravagant hall 
for the occasion, with a beautiful wooden chest 
as the centerpiece. They invited all the most important gods,
dozens of lesser deities, and foreign monarchs. But no one caused as big a stir as Set 
and Nephtys’s older brother Osiris, the god who ruled all of Egypt 
and had brought prosperity to everyone. Set announced a game— whoever could fit perfectly in the chest
could have it as a gift. One by one, the guests clambered in,
but no one fit. Finally, it was Osiris’s turn. As he lay down, everyone could see
it was a perfect fit— another win for the god 
who could do no wrong. Then Set slammed the lid down 
with Osiris still inside, sealed it shut, and tossed it into the Nile. The chest was a coffin. Set had constructed it specifically 
to trap his brother and planned the party to lure him into it. Set had long been jealous 
of his brother’s successful reign, and hoped to replace 
him as the ruler of all Egypt. The Nile bore the coffin out to sea 
and it drifted for many days before washing ashore near Byblos, 
where a great cedar grew around it. The essence of the god within 
gave the tree a divine aura, and when the king of Byblos noticed it, he ordered the tree cut down
and brought to his palace. Unbeknownst to him, the coffin containing Egypt’s 
most powerful god was still inside. Set’s victory seemed complete, 
but he hadn’t counted on his sisters. Set’s wife Nephtys was also his sister, while their other sister, 
the goddess Isis, was married to their brother Osiris. Isis was determined to find Osiris, and enlisted Nephtys’s help 
behind Set’s back. The two sisters took the shape 
of falcons and travelled far and wide. Some children who had seen 
the coffin float by pointed them to the palace of Byblos. Isis adopted a new disguise 
and approached the palace. The queen was so charmed 
by the disguised goddess that she entrusted her 
with nursing the baby prince. Isis decided to make the child immortal 
by bathing him in flame. When the horrified queen 
came upon this scene, Isis revealed herself 
and demanded the tree. When she cut the coffin from the trunk
and opened it, Osiris was dead inside. Weeping, she carried his body 
back to Egypt and hid it in a swamp, while she set off in search 
of a means of resurrecting him. But while she was gone, Set found the body 
and cut it into many pieces, scattering them throughout Egypt. Isis had lost Osiris for the second time,
but she did not give up. She searched all over the land,

**Transcript**:
In the sun-dappled streets 
of a small town, a proud mother 
showed off her newborn son. Upon noticing his lucky birthmark, townsfolk predicted 
he would marry a princess. But soon, these rumors reached the ears 
of the wicked king. Enraged, the king stole the child away, 
and sent him hurtling down the river. But the infant’s luck proved greater 
than the king’s plan. Years later, the king 
was traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man 
with an uncanny birthmark. After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy 
with a letter for the queen. The youth eagerly set out 
to deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying 
his own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits 
stumbled upon his camp. Yet when they read the brutal letter, 
they were filled with pity. Deciding to make trouble for the king 
instead, they scribbled a new note. As soon as the youth 
arrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess. The two felt destined for each other. And when the queen read 
that the king approved this union, she joyfully organized 
a whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, 
he was furious. But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s 
beloved without reason. So he devised a diabolical trial. He ordered the youth 
to travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs 
freshly plucked from the Devil’s head. Only upon succeeding 
could he return to his bride. The youth searched across the land 
for the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached 
an eerie village. Here, he saw some villagers 
gathered around a well. They closed in on the youth, 
refusing to let him pass until he answered their question: 
why was the well dry? The youth replied, 
“I will answer when I return.” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set 
of villagers contemplating a gnarled tree. They refused to let him pass 
until he answered their question: why was the tree barren? Again, the youth responded, 
“I will answer when I return." These villagers guided him to the dock, 
where an elderly ferryman awaited. As he paddled through the black water, 
the ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task? Once more, the youth promised, 
“I will answer when I return.” At last, they reached a hut sinking 
into the swampy banks of Hell. Reluctantly, the youth knocked 
on the rotting door. The devil’s grandmother 
answered his call. She was known to help some visiting souls,
and harm others. The youth had just finished his story 
when they heard the devil’s footsteps. Without warning, 
the boy’s world appeared to shrink. The devil’s grandmother lifted him 
into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson. The old woman set to work, 
lavishing the devil with food and drink. When he fell asleep, she deftly plucked 
three gleaming hairs from his head. With each plucked hair, the Devil briefly 
awoke and complained about his dreams, full of nearby villagers 
and their problems. The next morning, the youth departed— armed with three golden hairs, 
and three pieces of information. He shared the devil’s first dream 
with the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars 
to a willing passenger, he would be free from his task. Back at the village, the youth declared 
that there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, 
and an enormous toad blocking the well. The villagers rewarded him handsomely 
for his help. Back from his journey, the youth thrust 
the devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law 
only had eyes for the gold. The sly youth told the king 
that even greater wealth awaited him across the river. Immediately, the king 
hastened to the riverbank. Eager to claim his riches, he held out his hands impatiently 
to the grinning ferryman— who happily handed over his oars.

**Transcript**:
In the sun-dappled streets 
of a small town, a proud mother 
showed off her newborn son. Upon noticing his lucky birthmark, townsfolk predicted 
he would marry a princess. But soon, these rumors reached the ears 
of the wicked king. Enraged, the king stole the child away, 
and sent him hurtling down the river. But the infant’s luck proved greater 
than the king’s plan. Years later, the king 
was traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man 
with an uncanny birthmark. After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy 
with a letter for the queen. The youth eagerly set out 
to deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying 
his own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits 
stumbled upon his camp. Yet when they read the brutal letter, 
they were filled with pity. Deciding to make trouble for the king 
instead, they scribbled a new note. As soon as the youth 
arrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess. The two felt destined for each other. And when the queen read 
that the king approved this union, she joyfully organized 
a whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, 
he was furious. But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s 
beloved without reason. So he devised a diabolical trial. He ordered the youth 
to travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs 
freshly plucked from the Devil’s head. Only upon succeeding 
could he return to his bride. The youth searched across the land 
for the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached 
an eerie village. Here, he saw some villagers 
gathered around a well. They closed in on the youth, 
refusing to let him pass until he answered their question: 
why was the well dry? The youth replied, 
“I will answer when I return.” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set 
of villagers contemplating a gnarled tree. They refused to let him pass 
until he answered their question: why was the tree barren? Again, the youth responded, 
“I will answer when I return." These villagers guided him to the dock, 
where an elderly ferryman awaited. As he paddled through the black water, 
the ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task? Once more, the youth promised, 
“I will answer when I return.” At last, they reached a hut sinking 
into the swampy banks of Hell. Reluctantly, the youth knocked 
on the rotting door. The devil’s grandmother 
answered his call. She was known to help some visiting souls,
and harm others. The youth had just finished his story 
when they heard the devil’s footsteps. Without warning, 
the boy’s world appeared to shrink. The devil’s grandmother lifted him 
into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson. The old woman set to work, 
lavishing the devil with food and drink. When he fell asleep, she deftly plucked 
three gleaming hairs from his head. With each plucked hair, the Devil briefly 
awoke and complained about his dreams, full of nearby villagers 
and their problems. The next morning, the youth departed— armed with three golden hairs, 
and three pieces of information. He shared the devil’s first dream 
with the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars 
to a willing passenger, he would be free from his task. Back at the village, the youth declared 
that there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, 
and an enormous toad blocking the well. The villagers rewarded him handsomely 
for his help. Back from his journey, the youth thrust 
the devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law 
only had eyes for the gold. The sly youth told the king 
that even greater wealth awaited him across the river. Immediately, the king 
hastened to the riverbank. Eager to claim his riches, he held out his hands impatiently 
to the grinning ferryman— who happily handed over his oars.

**Transcript**:
When Nicolas Bourbaki applied 
to the American Mathematical Society in the 1950s, he was already one of the most influential
mathematicians of his time. He’d published articles 
in international journals and his textbooks were required reading. Yet his application was firmly rejected 
for one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist. Two decades earlier, 
mathematics was in disarray. Many established mathematicians had lost 
their lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented. Different branches used disparate 
methodology to pursue their own goals. And the lack of a shared 
mathematical language made it difficult to share 
or expand their work. In 1934, a group of French mathematicians 
were particularly fed up. While studying at the prestigious 
École normale supérieure, they found the textbook 
for their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one. The small group 
quickly took on new members, and as the project grew, 
so did their ambition. The result was 
the "Éléments de mathématique," a treatise that sought to create 
a consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics. The text began 
with a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use 
to build its argument. From there, its authors derived 
more and more complex theorems that corresponded with work 
being done across the field. But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify 
consistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems. To accomplish this, they gave new, 
clear definitions to some of the most important 
mathematical objects, including the function. It’s reasonable to think of functions 
as machines that accept inputs and produce an output. But if we think of functions 
as bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about 
the logical relationships between them. For example, consider a group of numbers
and a group of letters. We could define a function where 
every numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish 
a particularly interesting relationship. Alternatively, we could define a function 
where every numerical input corresponds to a different 
alphabetical output. This second function sets up 
a logical relationship where performing a process on the input 
has corresponding effects on its mapped output. The group began to define functions by how
they mapped elements across domains. If a function’s output came 
from a unique input, they defined it as injective. If every output can be mapped 
onto at least one input, the function was surjective. And in bijective functions, each element 
had perfect one to one correspondence. This allowed mathematicians to establish 
logic that could be translated across the function’s domains 
in both directions. Their systematic approach 
to abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular 
belief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic 
constrained creativity. But this rebellious band of scholars 
gleefully ignored conventional wisdom. They were revolutionizing the field, 
and they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet. They decided to publish 
"Éléments de mathématique" and all their subsequent work 
under a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s 
publications became standard references. And the group’s members took their prank 
as seriously as their work. Their invented mathematician claimed 
to be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet 
with his selected collaborators. They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, 
announced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone 
who doubted his existence. In 1968, when they could 
no longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke 
the only way they could. They printed Bourbaki’s obituary,
complete with mathematical puns. Despite his apparent death, the group 
bearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated 
with any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs 
much current research. And the modern emphasis on formal proofs
owes a great deal to his rigorous methods. Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— 
but his legacy is very real.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After carefully evaluating the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Why did the group of scholars publish their work under a collective pseudonym, Nicolas Bourbaki?**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and options of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about what to do when finding unsatisfactory scientific explanations, and one option is to form a secret society, do tangible work, and publish results under a collective pseudonym. Question 7 asks about the reason behind publishing under a collective pseudonym, which is related to the group's actions in response to unsatisfactory explanations.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and intent.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **7**

Keep in mind that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match might require generating new MCQs that more closely align with the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Why did the group of scholars publish their work under a collective pseudonym, Nicolas Bourbaki?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the nature of Nicolas Bourbaki (real mathematician, hoax, collective pseudonym, or physicist), while Question 7 asks about the reason behind the group's decision to publish under a collective pseudonym. However, the correct answer to Question 7 (A. To mark the occasion of revolutionizing the field of mathematics) implies that Nicolas Bourbaki is a collective pseudonym, which aligns with the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (C. collective pseudonym).

The other generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ as closely, as they either ask about different aspects of Nicolas Bourbaki's story or do not provide options that align with the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the question is phrased differently, it deals with the definition of a specific type of function, which is the same intent as the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer in the ground truth MCQ is a surjective function, which is defined as "all elements in the set of outputs can be traced to one or more elements in the set of inputs." In Question 5, the definition of a surjective function is not explicitly provided, but it is mentioned alongside other types of functions (injective and bijective), which indicates that the question is related to the same topic.

However, it's worth noting that the correct answer in Question 5 is actually "A. Surjective" is incorrect according to the definition provided in the ground truth MCQ. According to the transcript, a function is injective if its output comes from a unique input, which matches option B in Question 5.

Therefore, while Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, it is not a perfect match, and the correct answer does not align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When Nicolas Bourbaki applied 
to the American Mathematical Society in the 1950s, he was already one of the most influential
mathematicians of his time. He’d published articles 
in international journals and his textbooks were required reading. Yet his application was firmly rejected 
for one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist. Two decades earlier, 
mathematics was in disarray. Many established mathematicians had lost 
their lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented. Different branches used disparate 
methodology to pursue their own goals. And the lack of a shared 
mathematical language made it difficult to share 
or expand their work. In 1934, a group of French mathematicians 
were particularly fed up. While studying at the prestigious 
École normale supérieure, they found the textbook 
for their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one. The small group 
quickly took on new members, and as the project grew, 
so did their ambition. The result was 
the "Éléments de mathématique," a treatise that sought to create 
a consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics. The text began 
with a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use 
to build its argument. From there, its authors derived 
more and more complex theorems that corresponded with work 
being done across the field. But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify 
consistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems. To accomplish this, they gave new, 
clear definitions to some of the most important 
mathematical objects, including the function. It’s reasonable to think of functions 
as machines that accept inputs and produce an output. But if we think of functions 
as bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about 
the logical relationships between them. For example, consider a group of numbers
and a group of letters. We could define a function where 
every numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish 
a particularly interesting relationship. Alternatively, we could define a function 
where every numerical input corresponds to a different 
alphabetical output. This second function sets up 
a logical relationship where performing a process on the input 
has corresponding effects on its mapped output. The group began to define functions by how
they mapped elements across domains. If a function’s output came 
from a unique input, they defined it as injective. If every output can be mapped 
onto at least one input, the function was surjective. And in bijective functions, each element 
had perfect one to one correspondence. This allowed mathematicians to establish 
logic that could be translated across the function’s domains 
in both directions. Their systematic approach 
to abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular 
belief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic 
constrained creativity. But this rebellious band of scholars 
gleefully ignored conventional wisdom. They were revolutionizing the field, 
and they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet. They decided to publish 
"Éléments de mathématique" and all their subsequent work 
under a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s 
publications became standard references. And the group’s members took their prank 
as seriously as their work. Their invented mathematician claimed 
to be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet 
with his selected collaborators. They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, 
announced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone 
who doubted his existence. In 1968, when they could 
no longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke 
the only way they could. They printed Bourbaki’s obituary,
complete with mathematical puns. Despite his apparent death, the group 
bearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated 
with any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs 
much current research. And the modern emphasis on formal proofs
owes a great deal to his rigorous methods. Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— 
but his legacy is very real.

Hi I'm Ellie and these a four of my
favourite things. Bananas, my red coat, tomato soup and comic books. But what do they all
have in common? Two little words, pop and art. Pop art is more
than an art movement, it's a lifestyle, a craze, a way of looking at the world. But
what is pop art? Pop is young, bold and fun! This is life in the 40s
 it's a bit grey In the 50s, people wanted plastic and
glamour. They wanted to have a good time Buy more, spend more.
Don't just watch TV, be on TV now you can listen to The Beatles and Elvis 
watch cartoons, eat popcorn, drive cars and become famous. Now it was pop art all
about culture. After all pop art means popular art. Art for all. But who were the
pop artists? Richard Hamilton, this guy. said pop art is low cost, young, witty,
glamorous and mass-produced Hamilton made collages using imagery he
found in glossy magazines, lifting images from films and advertising was
completely bonkers at the time This is one of the famous Marilyn portraits by
Andy Warhol. Who? Andy, Andy Warhol This guy. See? A cool guy. For Andy art was a
project. The same as a production line of coca-cola bottles or Campbell's Soup. He liked to use bright colours and silk screening techniques to produce art on a huge scale Pretty clever, I'd say. Pop art is
revolutionary! pop artists were competitive who could do what first? Warhol had his advertising Lichtenstein had his comic books Paolozzi had his collage and Minnie Mouse Wait, let's go back to Lichtenstein. He used Ben Day dots to make his artwork look like comics like the ones you get in
newspapers. Female artists were also rocking the pop art trend. This is 'The Only Blonde in the World' 
by English painter Pauline Boty. Pauline added fun
into her art and was a bit of rebel Girl power Pauline! Pop art came out of the gallery too Nicola L took this big red coat around the world
to get people to get involved with her performance. This made a real pop crowd
not the celebrity faces in other forms of pop art Pop art can also be found all
over the world In Iran Parviz Tanavoli  was a sculptor and painter Like other pop artists he made his art out of things that were
like they could be thrown away in New York Jean-Michel Basquiat remixed it
from hip hop and street art. pop is on TV on the radio and on the internet, like

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What is pop art, according to Ellie? 

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks for the meaning of Pop Art, and Question 2 asks for a description of what pop art is. Option B in Question 2, "A lifestyle, a craze, a way of looking at the world," is related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ, "Popular Art (or Art for All!)" as both convey the idea that pop art is more than just an art movement.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks for the meaning of Pop Art. Since this is not available, Question 2 is the closest match.

than an art movement, it's a lifestyle, a craze, a way of looking at the world. But
what is pop art? Pop is young, bold and fun! This is life in the 40s
 it's a bit grey In the 50s, people wanted plastic and
glamour. They wanted to have a good time Buy more, spend more.
Don't just watch TV, be on TV now you can listen to The Beatles and Elvis 
watch cartoons, eat popcorn, drive cars and become famous. Now it was pop art all
about culture. After all pop art means popular art. Art for all. But who were the
pop artists? Richard Hamilton, this guy. said pop art is low cost, young, witty,
glamorous and mass-produced Hamilton made collages using imagery he
found in glossy magazines, lifting images from films and advertising was
completely bonkers at the time This is one of the famous Marilyn portraits by
Andy Warhol. Who? Andy, Andy Warhol This guy. See? A cool guy. For Andy art was a
project. The same as a production line of coca-cola bottles or Campbell's Soup. He liked to use bright colours and silk screening techniques to produce art on a huge scale Pretty clever, I'd say. Pop art is
revolutionary! pop artists were competitive who could do what first? Warhol had his advertising Lichtenstein had his comic books Paolozzi had his collage and Minnie Mouse Wait, let's go back to Lichtenstein. He used Ben Day dots to make his artwork look like comics like the ones you get in
newspapers. Female artists were also rocking the pop art trend. This is 'The Only Blonde in the World' 
by English painter Pauline Boty. Pauline added fun
into her art and was a bit of rebel Girl power Pauline! Pop art came out of the gallery too Nicola L took this big red coat around the world
to get people to get involved with her performance. This made a real pop crowd
not the celebrity faces in other forms of pop art Pop art can also be found all
over the world In Iran Parviz Tanavoli  was a sculptor and painter Like other pop artists he made his art out of things that were
like they could be thrown away in New York Jean-Michel Basquiat remixed it
from hip hop and street art. pop is on TV on the radio and on the internet, like
right now! Does that mean I'm pop art? Well, there's one thing Andy Warhol and I can agree on I don't know where the artificial stops and the real starts

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7: How did the protagonist feel when their parents and grandparents kept saying no to their requests? is not the best match because the ground truth question is about what makes the Little Critter mad, not how he feels.

However, some of the options in the generated MCQs match the options in the ground truth MCQ. 

A better match is not available, but if I must choose, I would say that Question 2: Why was the protagonist of the story initially upset? is the closest match because it talks about what makes the protagonist upset, but it doesn't have the same options as the ground truth MCQ.

But if I look at the options of the generated MCQs I can see that:

- Option B of Question 2 is "They couldn't keep frogs in the bathtub." which is Option C of the ground truth MCQ.
- Option B of Question 6 is "Tickle them" which is Option B of the ground truth MCQ.
- There is no generated MCQ that has an option that matches Option A of the ground truth MCQ "He cannot play with his sister's dollhouse."

So, I can see that the options of the ground truth MCQ are spread across multiple generated MCQs.

In this case, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I must choose, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

**Transcript**:
Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with 
an infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start 
to communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky 
proposed a theory based on the observation that the key 
to this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure 
of an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are 
grammatical rules that apply to all languages,
and that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process
language according to these rules. He labelled this faculty 
universal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry 
that shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field 
of cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers 
set out to investigate the two main components 
of universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, 
grammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules 
are hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish 
the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool
known as generative syntax, which represents the order of words 
in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest 
a grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data, 
it quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear 
outside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates 
a major problem: it takes a lot of data 
from each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages 
might have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume 
of recorded samples necessary to analyze them 
using generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language
is incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still
haven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data 
was gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages 
around the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were 
universal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate 
this variation. According to his new hypothesis 
of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain 
grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, 
or the application of these principles. For example, a principle is 
“every sentence must have a subject," but the parameter of whether the subject
must be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles 
and parameters still didn’t answer the question of which
grammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested 
that there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures
can be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence 
within a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds 
a noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate 
for a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists 
published findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have 
any recursive structures. So what about the other part 
of Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically 
determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm, 
called behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal 
and human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside 
by the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism 
was wrong, and there is underlying, 
genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology 
responsible for language is also responsible for other 
aspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated,
innate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar
prompted the documentation and study of many languages 
that hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be 
reevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing 
understanding of the human brain.

are hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish 
the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool
known as generative syntax, which represents the order of words 
in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest 
a grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data, 
it quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear 
outside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates 
a major problem: it takes a lot of data 
from each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages 
might have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume 
of recorded samples necessary to analyze them 
using generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language
is incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still
haven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data 
was gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages 
around the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were 
universal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate 
this variation. According to his new hypothesis 
of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain 
grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, 
or the application of these principles. For example, a principle is 
“every sentence must have a subject," but the parameter of whether the subject
must be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles 
and parameters still didn’t answer the question of which
grammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested 
that there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures
can be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence 
within a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds 
a noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate 
for a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists 
published findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have 
any recursive structures. So what about the other part 
of Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically 
determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm, 
called behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal 
and human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside 
by the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism 
was wrong, and there is underlying, 
genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology 
responsible for language is also responsible for other 
aspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated,
innate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar
prompted the documentation and study of many languages 
that hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be 
reevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing 
understanding of the human brain.

**Transcript**:
Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with 
an infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start 
to communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky 
proposed a theory based on the observation that the key 
to this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure 
of an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are 
grammatical rules that apply to all languages,
and that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process
language according to these rules. He labelled this faculty 
universal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry 
that shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field 
of cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers 
set out to investigate the two main components 
of universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, 
grammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules 
are hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish 
the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the discipline in which Universal Grammar was couched in first and foremost. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 9 asks about the dominant paradigm that Chomsky's theory of universal grammar challenged, which is related to the field of study.

However, a more relevant question would be one that asks about the field of study related to Universal Grammar. In this case, Question 3 mentions "linguistic analysis" as an option, which is related to the field of linguistics.

But the most relevant question would be one that asks about the field of study in which Universal Grammar was proposed or developed. In this case, Question 6 mentions "linguistics" indirectly through the hypothesis "principles and parameters", which is a concept in linguistics.

However, considering all the questions, Question 9 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it is the only question that mentions a field of study or a paradigm, which is related to the discipline in which Universal Grammar was couched.

But since "linguistics" is mentioned in the passage as the field that Universal Grammar shaped, I would say that Question 3 is a bit more relevant than Question 9.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but only because it mentions a field of study related to linguistics.

**Transcript**:
“I am an invisible man.” “Mrs. Dalloway said she would 
buy the flowers herself.” “You are about to begin reading 
Italo Calvino's new novel.” These three opening lines, 
from Ralph Ellison’s "Invisible Man," Virginia Woolf’s "Mrs. Dalloway," and Italo Calvino’s 
"If on a winter’s night a traveler," each establish a different point of view. Who is telling a story, 
and from what perspective, are some of the most important choices 
an author makes. Told from a different point of view, 
a story can transform completely. Take this fairytale: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,"
the Prince called, "let down your hair." Rapunzel unbraided her hair 
and slung it out the window. The prince climbed her tresses 
into the tower. Rapunzel is typically told like this, 
with the narrator outside the story. This point of view is called third person. But Rapunzel can also be told 
by a character in the story— a first person narrator. The tail end of Rapunzel’s locks 
plopped down at my feet. I grabbed on and began to climb… ugh! I couldn’t untangle myself. Strands came off all over me, 
sticking to my sweat. In a first person narrative, the story 
can change dramatically depending on which character
is the narrator. Say Rapunzel was narrating 
instead of the prince: I hope he appreciates how long it takes 
to unbraid 25 feet of hair, I thought. OUCH! I'll be honest; I thought my scalp
would stretch off of my skull. "Can you climb any faster?" I yelled. In second person, the narrator addresses 
the story to the reader: He calls your name. He wants you 
to let your hair down. You just finished braiding it, but hey–
you don't get a lot of visitors. Third person, first person, 
and second person perspectives each have unique possibilities
and constraints. So how do you choose a point 
of view for your story? Constraints aren’t necessarily 
a bad thing— they can help focus a story 
or highlight certain elements. For example, a third person narrator is necessarily
a bit removed from the characters. But that can be good for stories 
where a feeling of distance is important. A third person narrator 
can be either limited, meaning they stick close to one 
character’s thoughts and feelings, or they can be omniscient, 
able to flit between characters’ minds and give the reader more information. A first person story creates closeness 
between the reader and the narrator. It’s also restricted 
by the narrator’s knowledge. This can create suspense as the reader finds out information
along with the character. A first person narrator 
doesn’t necessarily have to represent the character’s 
experience faithfully— they can be delusional or dishonest. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel 
"The Remains of the Day," Stevens, an aging British butler in 1956, 
recounts his many years of service, but fails to acknowledge the flaws 
of the man he serves. The cracks in his narrative eventually 
draw the reader’s attention to the under-acknowledged failings 
of the culture and class system he inhabits. Justin Torres’s novel, "We the Animals," begins with a plural 
first person narrator: “We were six snatching hands, 
six stomping feet; we were brothers, boys, three little kings
locked in a feud for more.” Partway through the story, 
the point of view shifts to first person singular,
from we to I, as the boys come of age and one brother feels alienated
from the others. Second person is a less common choice. It requires the writer to make the reader
suspend disbelief to become another “you.” Placing the reader 
in a character’s perspective can build urgency and suspense. Sometimes, though, second person is intended to distance 
the narrator from their own story, rather than bring the reader closer 
to the story. In these cases, second person narrators refer 
to themselves as “you” rather than “I.” Writers are constantly experimenting 
with fresh variations on point of view. New virtual and augmented 
reality technologies may expand the possibilities
for this experimentation. By placing people at a particular 
vantage point in virtual space, how might we change the way 
we tell and experience stories?

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the term for a narrator who is outside the story and refers to characters by name or pronoun?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. Both questions relate to the concept of narrative perspective and the role of the narrator. However, the ground truth MCQ is more general, asking about the question that point of view answers, while Question 8 is more specific, asking about the term for a narrator outside the story.

The other generated MCQs either focus on specific aspects of narrative perspective (e.g., Question 3, Question 4, Question 6) or deal with different topics altogether (e.g., Question 2, Question 5, Question 7).

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

is the narrator. Say Rapunzel was narrating 
instead of the prince: I hope he appreciates how long it takes 
to unbraid 25 feet of hair, I thought. OUCH! I'll be honest; I thought my scalp
would stretch off of my skull. "Can you climb any faster?" I yelled. In second person, the narrator addresses 
the story to the reader: He calls your name. He wants you 
to let your hair down. You just finished braiding it, but hey–
you don't get a lot of visitors. Third person, first person, 
and second person perspectives each have unique possibilities
and constraints. So how do you choose a point 
of view for your story? Constraints aren’t necessarily 
a bad thing— they can help focus a story 
or highlight certain elements. For example, a third person narrator is necessarily
a bit removed from the characters. But that can be good for stories 
where a feeling of distance is important. A third person narrator 
can be either limited, meaning they stick close to one 
character’s thoughts and feelings, or they can be omniscient, 
able to flit between characters’ minds and give the reader more information. A first person story creates closeness 
between the reader and the narrator. It’s also restricted 
by the narrator’s knowledge. This can create suspense as the reader finds out information
along with the character. A first person narrator 
doesn’t necessarily have to represent the character’s 
experience faithfully— they can be delusional or dishonest. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel 
"The Remains of the Day," Stevens, an aging British butler in 1956, 
recounts his many years of service, but fails to acknowledge the flaws 
of the man he serves. The cracks in his narrative eventually 
draw the reader’s attention to the under-acknowledged failings 
of the culture and class system he inhabits. Justin Torres’s novel, "We the Animals," begins with a plural 
first person narrator: “We were six snatching hands, 
six stomping feet; we were brothers, boys, three little kings
locked in a feud for more.” Partway through the story, 
the point of view shifts to first person singular,
from we to I, as the boys come of age and one brother feels alienated
from the others. Second person is a less common choice. It requires the writer to make the reader
suspend disbelief to become another “you.” Placing the reader 
in a character’s perspective can build urgency and suspense. Sometimes, though, second person is intended to distance 
the narrator from their own story, rather than bring the reader closer 
to the story. In these cases, second person narrators refer 
to themselves as “you” rather than “I.” Writers are constantly experimenting 
with fresh variations on point of view. New virtual and augmented 
reality technologies may expand the possibilities
for this experimentation. By placing people at a particular 
vantage point in virtual space, how might we change the way 
we tell and experience stories?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 8 align with the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 asks about the term for a narrator who is outside the story, but one of the options (A. First-person) describes a narrator who is inside the story, which matches the ground truth MCQ's description of a first-person narrator. However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about a narrator who is a character inside the story using the pronouns "I" and "me." Unfortunately, no such question exists among the provided generated MCQs.

Given the available options, Question 8 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
“I am an invisible man.” “Mrs. Dalloway said she would 
buy the flowers herself.” “You are about to begin reading 
Italo Calvino's new novel.” These three opening lines, 
from Ralph Ellison’s "Invisible Man," Virginia Woolf’s "Mrs. Dalloway," and Italo Calvino’s 
"If on a winter’s night a traveler," each establish a different point of view. Who is telling a story, 
and from what perspective, are some of the most important choices 
an author makes. Told from a different point of view, 
a story can transform completely. Take this fairytale: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,"
the Prince called, "let down your hair." Rapunzel unbraided her hair 
and slung it out the window. The prince climbed her tresses 
into the tower. Rapunzel is typically told like this, 
with the narrator outside the story. This point of view is called third person. But Rapunzel can also be told 
by a character in the story— a first person narrator. The tail end of Rapunzel’s locks 
plopped down at my feet. I grabbed on and began to climb… ugh! I couldn’t untangle myself. Strands came off all over me, 
sticking to my sweat. In a first person narrative, the story 
can change dramatically depending on which character
is the narrator. Say Rapunzel was narrating 
instead of the prince: I hope he appreciates how long it takes 
to unbraid 25 feet of hair, I thought. OUCH! I'll be honest; I thought my scalp
would stretch off of my skull. "Can you climb any faster?" I yelled. In second person, the narrator addresses 
the story to the reader: He calls your name. He wants you 
to let your hair down. You just finished braiding it, but hey–
you don't get a lot of visitors. Third person, first person, 
and second person perspectives each have unique possibilities
and constraints. So how do you choose a point 
of view for your story? Constraints aren’t necessarily

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of these passages is told in third person point of view?
Options: A. Your mother tells you to go visit your sick grandmother. You’re annoyed because you had plans to go to the mall this afternoon, and you’ll probably be late now. Even though you’re supposed to stay on the path, you take the shortcut through the woods., B. The girl knocks on her grandmother’s door and, when no one answers, she enters. Her sick grandmother lies in the bed. “My,” the girl thinks, “everything about Grandma’s face looks...so big.”, C. My mother told me not to leave the path and cut through the woods, but whatever. I was the one making this walk twice a week, not Mom! Plus, the flowers in the woods were pretty, and I thought Grandma would like them. So that’s why I did it., D. You sneak into the house before the girl arrives and, in one gulp, you eat the grandmother. Then you put on one of her bonnets and look in the mirror. You look nothing like the grandmother. Your eyes, nose, mouth--everything is much bigger. Still, you think, maybe the girl won’t notice right away.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What is the term for a narrator who is outside the story and refers to characters by name or pronoun? 

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about identifying the point of view in a given passage. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the options provided, I would say Question 8 is the closest match, but only because it discusses narrative perspective, not because it matches the ground truth MCQ exactly.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that asks the reader to identify the point of view of a passage, and the options include different narrative perspectives (first person singular, first person plural, second person, third person limited, etc.).

Since there isn't an exact match, I will provide the index of the closest match:

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, some questions are more related to the topic than others.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match. Although it doesn't ask about the day before Saturday, it does ask about the sequence of days, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the sequence of days, specifically which day comes before another. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 3 is the closest match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ would be a question that asks about what "water" includes, with options that include various types of fluids.

Since this question is not explicitly listed, I will provide an answer based on the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The closest match is:

None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the topic of "water" and its related concepts, I would suggest Question 3, which talks about the effects of dehydration on urine. However, this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would be a question that asks about what "water" includes.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

 Question 3 (weak match)

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate match would be a question that asks about what "water" includes, with options that include various types of fluids.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, in terms of options and specific question content, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest.

But since the options of Question 5 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will re-evaluate the generated MCQs.

Upon re-evaluation, I found that Question 7 is the closest in terms of options and content. Question 7 asks about the percentage of the Earth's water that is fresh and available for drinking, and one of the options is 2.5%, which is mentioned in the transcript as the percentage of fresh water on Earth. Another option is 1%, which is mentioned as the percentage of fresh water available for drinking.

However, the ground truth MCQ asks about the amount of water lost per day, which is not directly related to the percentage of fresh water on Earth.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, since it is the only question that mentions a specific quantity (percentage) related to the human body, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
every living organism we know of requires water to survive it's part of the reason we look so feverishly for water on other planets Across the Universe and consume it consistently every day here on Earth so what would happen to your body if you stopped drinking water of course when we say water we're including all fluids which simply contain water like juices pop or tea much like the desire to breathe in oxygen thirst is a survival Instinct H2O is the most abundant molecule in the human body making up on average 65% of an adult as a universal solvent it carries nutrients and hormones through the body regulates body temperature cushions our joints and even lubricates our eyes you produce around 1.5 L of urine every day with another liter lost from breathing sweating and pooping so it's essential that the body replaces this liquid The Thirst center of the brain is located in the hypothalamus and is constantly using sensors in your blood vessels to monitor the amount of sodium and other substances in your body for example if you sweat too much your blood volume and pressure fall the brain then detects this change and creates the urge to drink something now so what happens if you're unable to satisfy this thirst the initial signs of dehydration are the obvious dry mouth following which your urine becomes darker with a stronger odor as your body attempts to conserve more fluids the lack of H2O then begins to affect your brain you might feel light-headed have a slower response time and decreased ability to feel pain in fact when you're dehydrated your brain tissue literally shrinks in studies observing hydrated versus dehydrated participants the same task required more brain power and oxygen in dehydrated individuals compared to those fully hydrated after a day or two with no fluids you'll stop peeing altogether have trouble swallowing suffer from muscle spasms and likely experience nausea after all your body can survive without food much longer and attention to digestion is not a priority at this point eventually victims may become Delirious with severely impaired brain function interestingly studies looking at elderly patients who suffer from delirium found that many are simply suffering from chronic dehydration in the first place after even more time without water the blood stops flowing to your skin reducing heat loss but increasing your core body temperature this can lead to a gray bluish tinge to your skin Beyond 3 to 5 days without water and your body will begin to shut down its organs and eventually the brain of course unlike the plentiful oxygen we breathe only 2.5% of All Earth's water is fresh most of which is locked up in glaciers ice caps and underground Lakes known as aquifers leaving less than 1% available for drinking and most of this water is actually used to grow crops approximately 500 billion lers of fresh water is used daily for agriculture in the USA alone with another 500 billion lers to cool electric power plants and as our personal drinking sources become increasingly contaminated over 783 million people on Earth are unable to access clean water scientists around the world are trying to find solutions to this problem from attempts to remove salt from the ocean water tap into underground acers and creating Innovative water filtration systems if we look to space NASA has developed technology for astronauts to turn their urine into water more pure than what we drink on Earth but we can't just rely on Science and Technology perhaps the solution relies on us as a species to understand and contribute to This Global Water Crisis if you want to help in the mission to end Global thirst join in World water day on March 22nd there are a lot of really amazing projects out there like water.org or even the awesome UNICEF app which donates one day of clean water to a child in need for every 10 minutes you put your phone down we'll leave links in the description for these and other great water Charities small Investments really do make a huge difference we'll be donating all the proceeds from this video to a water project close to us called Morocco 5 Villages so thanks for supporting and watching And subscribe for more weekly science videos

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What percentage of the Earth's water is fresh and available for drinking? Options: A. 1%, B. 2.5%, C. 5%, D. 10% 

Although the options in Question 7 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks where the small amount of available water is found, and the correct answer is "all of the above" (ice caps, glaciers, and underground aquifers). Question 7, on the other hand, asks about the percentage of fresh water available for drinking, which is related to the idea that only a small amount of water is available for human use.

However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks "Where is the small amount of available fresh water found?" with options similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

**Transcript**:
OBKidz! Max and the Tag-Along Moon. Grandfather, grandson, and the moon above
them both, by Floyd Cooper One night, as Max was leaving Granpa's house,
he reached up to give Granpa a big hug good-bye. In the sky behind Granpa appeared a big fine
moon. "Look, Granpa, the moon!" "That ol' moon will always shine for you...
on and on!" Granpa and Max gazed quietly at the big moon
together as it embraced them in soft yellow light. -----
Max smiled at the moon and Granpa, then climbed into the car. "Bye-bye, Granpa! Bye-bye, moon!" As the car pulled away, Max kept his eyes
on Granpa until he disappeared from sight, and all he saw was the moon. Max kept his eyes on that moon, waiting for
it to disappear, too. The long ride hoe was swervy-curvy. This way and that, all the way. And the moon seemed to tag along. Max giggled as he watched the beautiful bright
orb flicker through the passing trees, trailing behind the car as it traveled home, this way
and that, playing peekaboo. Up a hill, down a hill, the moon was ever
there. Over a bridge, around a curve, the moon bounced
along! Around a tree, past a field of sleeping cows,
the moon stayed quietly with Max. Through a small town with roundabout streets,
Max gazed as the moon kept up. At the mouth of a tunnel and out the other
end, Max smiled when he saw the moon there, waiting. Dark clouds tumbled across the night sky. The stars and nightingales all faded away. Max searched the darkness and wondered, where
is the moon? Granpa said it would always shine for me. Finally home, Max took one last look up at
the empty night sky. "I guess that ol' moon couldn't shine for
me all the way home." Upstairs in bed, the room was dark. Max felt alone. He missed Granpa. He missed that tag-along moon. Then slowly, very slowly, Max's bedroom began
to fill with a soft yellow glow. The clouds faded away and the moon peeked
through! Max gazed up at that magic ball of light and
thought about what Granpa said. "That ol' moon will always shine for me...
on and on!" Max knew then that whenever he saw the moon,
he would think of Granpa, on and on. And he slept soundly, embraced in soft yellow
light.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the question stems and options are not identical, both questions relate to Max's emotional state when he is separated from something or someone he cares about. In the ground truth MCQ, Max feels a certain way when the moon disappears, and in Question 7, Max feels alone because he misses Granpa and the moon. The correct options in both questions convey a sense of loss or longing.

However, it's worth noting that the match is not perfect, as the question stems and options are not identical. A more similar generated MCQ would have a question stem that specifically asks about Max's emotional state when the moon disappears and options that include the correct answer, "disappointed." 

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 7, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Two sisters take the same DNA test. The results show that one sister 
is 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set 
of ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French 
than the other? Tests like these rely on our DNA 
to answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually 
can’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great 
at answering some questions, like who your parents are, but 
can provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors 
from a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where
our DNA comes from in the first place. Each person’s DNA consists 
of about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—
46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount 
of information, but 99% of our genome 
is shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything
distinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize 
less than 1% of that 1%. One chromosome in each pair 
comes from each parent. These halves join at conception: 
when a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, 
combine. The story of our ancestry becomes
muddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes 
in a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes 
of every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 
chromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair 
swap some sections. This process is called recombination, 
and it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes 
that are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely 
in each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different
not only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA 
from each parent, but going further back 
things get more complicated. Without recombination, you would get 
1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, 
and so on, but because recombination happens 
every generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed 
an ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented
in your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come 
from each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, 
that number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high—
or it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more 
ancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply
more represented in her DNA. But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA 
of the sisters' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes 
of deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results 
are based on a comparison to the DNA of people 
living in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, 
or combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences 
that appear in specific places. The sister deemed "more French" 
shares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these 
shared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France. It’s important to note that results 
are based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples 
are barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people
not represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove 
race or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, 
your results might change. Looking further back, you may get a result
like 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate 
species from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% 
of our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations 
interbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today 
have Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations 
in 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic 
contribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French 
and 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% 
of DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things. Looking for traces of our ancestry 
in our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA 
and the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things
with 100% certainty.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of intent and topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of chromosomes in which the DNA is arranged. The closest generated MCQ in terms of topic is Question 5, which asks about what commercial DNA tests use to determine an individual's ancestry. However, it does not directly relate to the number of chromosomes.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the structure or organization of DNA, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but only in a very broad sense. However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

are based on a comparison to the DNA of people 
living in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, 
or combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences 
that appear in specific places. The sister deemed "more French" 
shares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these 
shared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France. It’s important to note that results 
are based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples 
are barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people
not represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove 
race or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, 
your results might change. Looking further back, you may get a result
like 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate 
species from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% 
of our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations 
interbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today 
have Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations 
in 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic 
contribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French 
and 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% 
of DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things. Looking for traces of our ancestry 
in our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA 
and the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things
with 100% certainty.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of a mother's total DNA that an individual receives. The correct answer is 50%, which is a fundamental concept in genetics.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most relevant, but it does not directly address the ground truth MCQ. However, it does mention that commercial DNA tests use "Less than 1% of the 1% of the genome that varies among individuals" to determine an individual's ancestry, which implies that an individual receives a portion of their DNA from each parent.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the concept of inheritance, such as:

* What percentage of your DNA comes from each parent?
* How much of your mother's DNA do you inherit?

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would suggest Question 4, which mentions recombination and its effect on inheritance. However, it does not directly address the percentage of DNA inherited from each parent.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (although it's not a direct match)

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on the concepts of genetics, DNA testing, and ancestry, rather than the specific topic of inheritance. To create a more accurate match, I would recommend generating new MCQs that directly address the concept of inheritance and the percentage of DNA received from each parent.

**Transcript**:
Two sisters take the same DNA test. The results show that one sister 
is 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set 
of ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French 
than the other? Tests like these rely on our DNA 
to answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually 
can’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great 
at answering some questions, like who your parents are, but 
can provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors 
from a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where
our DNA comes from in the first place. Each person’s DNA consists 
of about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—
46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount 
of information, but 99% of our genome 
is shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything
distinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize 
less than 1% of that 1%. One chromosome in each pair 
comes from each parent. These halves join at conception: 
when a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, 
combine. The story of our ancestry becomes
muddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes 
in a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes 
of every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 
chromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair 
swap some sections. This process is called recombination, 
and it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes 
that are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely 
in each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different
not only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA 
from each parent, but going further back 
things get more complicated. Without recombination, you would get 
1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, 
and so on, but because recombination happens 
every generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed 
an ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented
in your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come 
from each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, 
that number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high—
or it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more 
ancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply
more represented in her DNA. But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA 
of the sisters' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes 
of deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "Who has belly buttons?" with options related to living things and their relationship with their mothers. Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 asks, "Which animals have belly buttons that are similar to those of humans?" Although this question is not an exact match, it is the closest in terms of discussing the presence of belly buttons in different entities.

However, if I had to choose a question that matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ more closely, I would suggest a combination of the content from Question 4 (Why do animals that lay eggs not have belly buttons?) and Question 5. Since this is not an option, I will provide the index of the closest match, which is:

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: Which animals have belly buttons that are similar to those of humans? Options: A. Dogs and cats, B. Chimpanzees and gorillas, C. Birds and reptiles, D. Fish and amphibians.

However, the options in Question 5 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that includes dogs, cats, and gorillas as options. Since there isn't an exact match, Question 5 is the closest match.

But, since the options of Question 5 do not match exactly, we can also consider Question 9, which mentions dogs and cats, but it does not include gorillas and does not ask about belly buttons directly.

A more suitable match can be constructed by combining elements of Question 5 and Question 9, but since that is not an option, the closest match is Question 5.

**Transcript**:
Consider this unfortunately 
familiar scenario. Several months ago a highly infectious,
sometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time. It then proliferated faster 
than public health measures could contain it. Now the World Health Organization (WHO)
has declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide. The death toll is starting to rise 
and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare 
the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop 
significantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends on
what global governments choose to do next. They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, 
or Coordinate and Crush. One is widely considered best, 
and it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and communities 
do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed 
as quickly as possible. Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about 
how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity 
almost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions 
to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus 
or the collapse of health care systems. Soon the majority of people 
have been infected and either perished or survived
by building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer
find new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out 
a short time after it began. But there’s another way to create 
herd immunity without such a high cost of life. Let’s reset the clock to the moment 
the WHO declared the pandemic. This time, governments and communities
around the world slow the spread of the virus 
to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tactics
that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected 
and people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place, 
the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands 
of deaths. Some cities get the outbreak under control
and go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing 
when a new case passes through. Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become 
widely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population 
has received it— the precise amount varying 
based on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, 
and the pandemic fizzles out. Let’s rewind the clock one more time, 
to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starve
the virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, 
social distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor 
is to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, 
when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding 
to what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world 
as the giant interconnected system it is. If coordinated properly, this could end 
a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life. But unless the virus is completely 
eradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will be risks of it escalating 
to pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals carrying 
and transmitting the virus might undermine 
our best efforts altogether. So which strategy is best for this deadly,
infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, 
but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all 
if people can be reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination 
alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true 
and nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why vaccination, assisted by 
as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, 
and proven option in the race. Even if the pandemic officially ends 
before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so 
vaccines will continue to protect people. And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives 
won’t necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment 
and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme 
containment measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting,
but not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, 
and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration 
from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential 
pandemic so contained that our children’s children 
won’t even know its name.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What is the main factor that determines when the WHO will declare a pandemic over?**

Although the question phrasing is not identical, the intent and content of Question 2 are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks when the WHO would likely declare a pandemic over, and the correct option is "When infection is mostly contained, and global rates of transmission drop substantially." Question 2 asks about the main factor that determines when the WHO will declare a pandemic over, and option B mentions "The rate of transmission dropping significantly," which is similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that Question 2 is not an exact match, and the options are not identical to the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What are the three main options that global governments have to respond to a pandemic? Options: A. Contain and Eradicate, Delay and Vaccinate, and Coordinate and Crush, B. Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, and Coordinate and Crush, C. Lockdown and Quarantine, Social Distancing, and Vaccination, D. Testing and Tracing, Treatment and Prevention, and Vaccination**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and options. The ground truth MCQ asks about a specific tactic used when nothing is done to halt the spread of the disease exposure, and the correct option is "Race through it". Question 3 mentions "Race through it" as one of the three main options that global governments have to respond to a pandemic.

However, a more similar question is not present in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose the most similar question based on the content, I would choose Question 4, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and intent.

Therefore, I would recommend the index of the most similar generated MCQ as **3**, but with the caveat that it is not an exact match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 4 has an option that matches the ground truth MCQ's correct option. However, the question intent is different.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the "Race through it" strategy specifically. Since there isn't a direct match, I would stick with my initial recommendation of **Question 3**, but I would like to highlight that **Question 4** has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would suggest **Question 4** as an alternative, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

**Alternative answer:** **4** (with the caveat that it is not an exact match)

**Primary answer:** **3** (with the caveat that it is not an exact match)

and nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why vaccination, assisted by 
as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady,

**Transcript**:
Consider this unfortunately 
familiar scenario. Several months ago a highly infectious,
sometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time. It then proliferated faster 
than public health measures could contain it. Now the World Health Organization (WHO)
has declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide. The death toll is starting to rise 
and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare 
the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop 
significantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends on
what global governments choose to do next. They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, 
or Coordinate and Crush. One is widely considered best, 
and it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and communities 
do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed 
as quickly as possible. Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about 
how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity 
almost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions 
to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus 
or the collapse of health care systems. Soon the majority of people 
have been infected and either perished or survived
by building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer
find new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out 
a short time after it began. But there’s another way to create 
herd immunity without such a high cost of life. Let’s reset the clock to the moment 
the WHO declared the pandemic. This time, governments and communities
around the world slow the spread of the virus 
to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tactics
that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected 
and people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place, 
the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands 
of deaths. Some cities get the outbreak under control
and go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing 
when a new case passes through. Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become 
widely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population 
has received it— the precise amount varying 
based on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, 
and the pandemic fizzles out. Let’s rewind the clock one more time, 
to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starve
the virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, 
social distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor 
is to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, 
when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding 
to what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world 
as the giant interconnected system it is. If coordinated properly, this could end 
a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life. But unless the virus is completely 
eradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will be risks of it escalating 
to pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals carrying 
and transmitting the virus might undermine 
our best efforts altogether. So which strategy is best for this deadly,
infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, 
but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all 
if people can be reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination 
alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true 
and nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why vaccination, assisted by 
as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, 
and proven option in the race. Even if the pandemic officially ends 
before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so 
vaccines will continue to protect people. And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives 
won’t necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment 
and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme 
containment measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting,
but not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, 
and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration 
from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential 
pandemic so contained that our children’s children 
won’t even know its name.

**Question 8: What is the speaker's goal when painting a subject? Options: A. To create a realistic representation, B. To capture the subject's emotions, C. To convey the speaker's impression of the subject, D. To create a abstract piece Correct Option: None**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the speaker's approach to painting, which is to capture the impression of what they see.

But the most similar question is:

**Question 2: What is the main focus of impressionist painting, according to the transcript? Options: A. Capturing precise details, B. Creating realistic scenes, C. Capturing fast, fleeting moments, D. Using vibrant colors Correct Option: None**

If the correct option were provided for this question, it would be more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Considering all the options, I would choose **Question 2** as the most similar generated MCQ, assuming the correct option is C (Capturing fast, fleeting moments) or an option that mentions "impression".

However, another question is even more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Question 6** is not the most similar, but **Question 8** is not the most similar either.

**Question 2** is the most similar, but another question is even more similar.

The most similar question is actually a combination of **Question 2** and **Question 6**, but since that is not an option, I will choose **Question 6**'s similar question:

**Question 8** is not the most similar, but **Question 6** is not the most similar either.

Since the correct option for the generated MCQs is not provided, I must choose the question that is most similar in content and intent.

**Question 2** and **Question 6** both have elements of the ground truth MCQ, but **Question 2** does not mention "impression" in the options.

**Question 8** has an option that mentions "impression", making it a strong candidate.

However, **Question 6** has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ.

Considering all the factors, I would choose **Question 8** or **Question 6**, but since **Question 8** has an option that mentions "impression", I will choose **Question 8**.

However, I must re-evaluate the options.

**Question 2** is a strong candidate, but **Question 8** is stronger.

**Question 6** is also a strong candidate.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would choose **Question 8**.

However, I must consider the options again.

**Question 8** is the most similar generated MCQ.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **8**

**Transcript**:
Arriving home after a long day, you settle
in for a quiet evening alone. But instead of the sound of silence, 
you hear a constant ringing— even though there’s nothing 
making any noise. What you’re experiencing 
is called tinnitus, the perception of a noise like ringing, 
buzzing, hissing or clicking that occurs without any external source 
of sound. Tinnitus has been bothering humanity 
since Ancient Babylon, plaguing everyone from Leonardo da Vinci 
to Charles Darwin. Today, roughly one in seven people 
worldwide experiences this auditory sensation. So where does this persistent sound 
come from? When you normally hear something, 
sound waves hit various areas of your ear, creating vibrations that displace fluid 
inside the cochlea. If the vibrations are large enough, they elicit a chemical response 
that transforms them into bioelectrical signals. These nerve impulses are then relayed 
through the hearing pathway to the brain, where they result 
in the sounds we perceive. However, in the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases, the nerve signals that produce 
these mysterious sounds don’t travel through your ear at all. Instead, they’re generated internally, 
by your own central nervous system. Under usual circumstances, 
these self-produced signals are an essential part of hearing. All mammals demonstrate 
on-going neural activity throughout their hearing pathways. When there are no sounds present, this activity is at a baseline 
that establishes your neural code for silence. When a sound does appear, 
this activity changes, allowing the brain to distinguish 
between silence and sound. But the auditory system’s health 
can affect this background signal. Loud noises, diseases, toxins, 
and even natural aging can damage your cochlear cells. Some of these may heal 
in a matter of hours. However, if enough cells die, 
either over time or all at once, the auditory system becomes 
less sensitive. With fewer cochlear cells 
relaying information, incoming sounds generate 
weaker nerve signals. And many environmental sounds 
can be lost completely. To compensate, your brain devotes more 
energy to monitoring the hearing pathway. Just like you might adjust 
the knobs of a radio, the brain modifies neural activity 
while also tweaking the tuning knob to get a clearer signal. Increasing this background neural activity
is intended to help you process weak auditory inputs. But it can also modify 
your baseline for silence— such that a lack of sound 
no longer sounds silent at all. This is called subjective tinnitus, and it accounts for the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases. Subjective tinnitus 
is a symptom associated with practically every known ear disorder, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. While its appearance can be surprising, subjective tinnitus has no inherently 
negative consequences. But for some, tinnitus episodes 
can trigger traumatic memories or otherwise distressing feelings, which increase the sound’s intrusiveness. This psychological loop often leads 
to what’s known as “bothersome tinnitus," a condition that can exacerbate 
the symptoms of PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. There’s no known cure 
for subjective tinnitus. So the most important thing 
doctors can do is help people understand 
this auditory event, and develop neutral associations 
with these often-distressing sounds. For example, sound therapy uses noises 
like rain, birdsong, or music to mask tinnitus and reduce stress. One form, called informational masking, 
uses soothing, complex auditory signals that distract the brain 
from the tinnitus sound. Another, called energetic masking, uses sounds with the same frequency 
as the patient’s tinnitus to occupy the neurons that would 
otherwise deliver the tinnitus signal. Practiced alongside counseling, these interventions allow 
people to re-evaluate their relationship with tinnitus. Losing the sound of silence 
can be troubling to say the least. Tinnitus reveals that your brain is 
constantly analyzing the world around you, even as it fails to filter 
its own internal noise. In a sense, experiencing tinnitus is like eavesdropping 
on your brain talking to itself— though it may not be a conversation 
you want to hear.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Tinnitus is best described as the perception of a sound that is:
Options: A. generated in the environment, B. generated in the ears of the person who hears it, C. generated inside the central nervous system of the person who hears it, D. usually hearable by other people in the vicinity of the tinnitus patient
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Where are the nerve signals that produce tinnitus sounds typically generated?
Options: A. The ear, B. The central nervous system, C. The brain stem, D. The auditory cortex
Correct Option: None

since Ancient Babylon, plaguing everyone from Leonardo da Vinci 
to Charles Darwin. Today, roughly one in seven people 
worldwide experiences this auditory sensation. So where does this persistent sound 
come from? When you normally hear something, 
sound waves hit various areas of your ear, creating vibrations that displace fluid 
inside the cochlea. If the vibrations are large enough, they elicit a chemical response 
that transforms them into bioelectrical signals. These nerve impulses are then relayed 
through the hearing pathway to the brain, where they result 
in the sounds we perceive. However, in the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases, the nerve signals that produce 
these mysterious sounds don’t travel through your ear at all. Instead, they’re generated internally, 
by your own central nervous system. Under usual circumstances, 
these self-produced signals are an essential part of hearing. All mammals demonstrate 
on-going neural activity throughout their hearing pathways. When there are no sounds present, this activity is at a baseline 
that establishes your neural code for silence. When a sound does appear, 
this activity changes, allowing the brain to distinguish 
between silence and sound. But the auditory system’s health 
can affect this background signal. Loud noises, diseases, toxins, 
and even natural aging can damage your cochlear cells. Some of these may heal 
in a matter of hours. However, if enough cells die, 
either over time or all at once, the auditory system becomes 
less sensitive. With fewer cochlear cells 
relaying information, incoming sounds generate 
weaker nerve signals. And many environmental sounds 
can be lost completely. To compensate, your brain devotes more 
energy to monitoring the hearing pathway. Just like you might adjust 
the knobs of a radio, the brain modifies neural activity 
while also tweaking the tuning knob to get a clearer signal. Increasing this background neural activity
is intended to help you process weak auditory inputs. But it can also modify 
your baseline for silence— such that a lack of sound 
no longer sounds silent at all. This is called subjective tinnitus, and it accounts for the vast majority 
of tinnitus cases. Subjective tinnitus 
is a symptom associated with practically every known ear disorder, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing. While its appearance can be surprising, subjective tinnitus has no inherently 
negative consequences. But for some, tinnitus episodes 
can trigger traumatic memories or otherwise distressing feelings, which increase the sound’s intrusiveness. This psychological loop often leads 
to what’s known as “bothersome tinnitus," a condition that can exacerbate 
the symptoms of PTSD, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. There’s no known cure 
for subjective tinnitus. So the most important thing 
doctors can do is help people understand 
this auditory event, and develop neutral associations 
with these often-distressing sounds. For example, sound therapy uses noises 
like rain, birdsong, or music to mask tinnitus and reduce stress. One form, called informational masking, 
uses soothing, complex auditory signals that distract the brain 
from the tinnitus sound. Another, called energetic masking, uses sounds with the same frequency 
as the patient’s tinnitus to occupy the neurons that would 
otherwise deliver the tinnitus signal. Practiced alongside counseling, these interventions allow 
people to re-evaluate their relationship with tinnitus. Losing the sound of silence 
can be troubling to say the least. Tinnitus reveals that your brain is 
constantly analyzing the world around you, even as it fails to filter 
its own internal noise. In a sense, experiencing tinnitus is like eavesdropping 
on your brain talking to itself— though it may not be a conversation 
you want to hear.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re the chief advisor 
to an eccentric king who needs to declare his successor. He wants his heir to be good 
at arithmetic, lucky, and above all else, honest. So he’s devised a competition 
to test his children, and ordered you to choose the winner. Each potential heir will be given 
the same two six-sided dice. The red die has the numbers 
2, 7, 7, 12, 12, and 17. The blue one has 
3, 8, 8, 13, 13, and 18. The dice are fair, so each side 
is equally likely to come up. Each contestant will be sent 
into a Royal Rolling Room, where they’ll roll both dice 
20 times. A contestant’s score starts at zero, 
and each turn, they should add the total 
of the two numbers rolled to their score. After 20 turns, they should report 
their final score. The rooms are secure, 
and no one observes the rolls. That means a contestant could 
add incorrectly, or worse, be dishonest and make up a score they didn’t achieve. This is where you come in. The king has instructed you that 
if you’re at least 90% sure a contestant mis-added or cheated, 
you should disqualify them. The highest-scoring player who remains 
will be the new heir to the throne. After you explain the rules, 
the children run to their rooms. When they return, 
Alexa announces her score is 385. Bertram says 840. Cassandra reports 700. 
And Draco declares 423. The future of the kingdom 
is in your hands. Whom do you proclaim 
to be the worthiest successor? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Upon inspection, 
most of these scores are concerning. Let’s start with the highest. Bertram scored 840. That’s impressive… 
but is it even possible? The highest numbers on the two dice 
are 17 and 18. 17 plus 18 is 35, so in 20 rolls, the greatest possible total 
is 20 times 35, or 700. Even if Bertram rolled 
all the highest numbers, he couldn’t have scored 840. So he’s disqualified. Cassandra, the next-highest roller, 
reported 700. That’s theoretically possible… 
but how hard is it to be that lucky? In order to get 700, Cassandra would have to roll 
the highest number out of six on 40 separate occasions. The probability of this is 1 over 6 
to the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion— 
that’s 13 followed by 30 zeros. To put that in perspective, there are 
about 7.5 billion people in the world, and 7.5 billion squared 
is a lot less than 13 nonillion. Rolling the highest number 
all 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random 
person on Earth, and it turned out 
to be actor Paul Rudd… and then you randomly picked again, 
and got Paul Rudd again! You can’t be 100% sure that Cassandra’s 
score didn’t happen by chance… but you can certainly be 90% sure, 
so she should be disqualified. Next up is Draco, with 423. This score isn’t high enough 
to be suspicious. But it’s impossible 
for a different reason. Pick a number from each die, 
and add them up. No matter which combination you choose, 
the result ends in a 0 or a 5. That’s because every red number 
is 2 more than a multiple of 5, and every blue number 
is 3 more than a multiple of 5. This means that when you add 
them together, you’ll always get an exact multiple of 5. And when you add rolls 
that are multiples of 5, the result will also be a multiple of 5. These sorts of relationships 
between integers are studied in a branch of math called number theory. Here number theory shows 
us that Draco’s score, which is not a multiple of 5,
cannot be achieved. So he should be disqualified as well. This leaves Alexa, 
whose score is a multiple of 5 and is in the achievable range. In fact, the most likely score is 400, 
so she was a little bit unlucky. But with everyone else disqualified, 
she’s the last heir standing. All hail Queen Alexa,

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re the chief advisor 
to an eccentric king who needs to declare his successor. He wants his heir to be good 
at arithmetic, lucky, and above all else, honest. So he’s devised a competition 
to test his children, and ordered you to choose the winner. Each potential heir will be given 
the same two six-sided dice. The red die has the numbers 
2, 7, 7, 12, 12, and 17. The blue one has 
3, 8, 8, 13, 13, and 18. The dice are fair, so each side 
is equally likely to come up. Each contestant will be sent 
into a Royal Rolling Room, where they’ll roll both dice 
20 times. A contestant’s score starts at zero, 
and each turn, they should add the total 
of the two numbers rolled to their score. After 20 turns, they should report 
their final score. The rooms are secure, 
and no one observes the rolls. That means a contestant could 
add incorrectly, or worse, be dishonest and make up a score they didn’t achieve. This is where you come in. The king has instructed you that 
if you’re at least 90% sure a contestant mis-added or cheated, 
you should disqualify them. The highest-scoring player who remains 
will be the new heir to the throne. After you explain the rules, 
the children run to their rooms. When they return, 
Alexa announces her score is 385. Bertram says 840. Cassandra reports 700. 
And Draco declares 423. The future of the kingdom 
is in your hands. Whom do you proclaim 
to be the worthiest successor? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Upon inspection, 
most of these scores are concerning. Let’s start with the highest. Bertram scored 840. That’s impressive… 
but is it even possible? The highest numbers on the two dice 
are 17 and 18. 17 plus 18 is 35, so in 20 rolls, the greatest possible total 
is 20 times 35, or 700. Even if Bertram rolled 
all the highest numbers, he couldn’t have scored 840. So he’s disqualified. Cassandra, the next-highest roller, 
reported 700. That’s theoretically possible… 
but how hard is it to be that lucky? In order to get 700, Cassandra would have to roll 
the highest number out of six on 40 separate occasions. The probability of this is 1 over 6 
to the 40th power, or 1 in about 13 nonillion— 
that’s 13 followed by 30 zeros. To put that in perspective, there are 
about 7.5 billion people in the world, and 7.5 billion squared 
is a lot less than 13 nonillion. Rolling the highest number 
all 40 times is much less likely than if you picked a completely random 
person on Earth, and it turned out 
to be actor Paul Rudd… and then you randomly picked again, 
and got Paul Rudd again! You can’t be 100% sure that Cassandra’s 
score didn’t happen by chance… but you can certainly be 90% sure, 
so she should be disqualified. Next up is Draco, with 423. This score isn’t high enough 
to be suspicious. But it’s impossible 
for a different reason. Pick a number from each die, 
and add them up. No matter which combination you choose, 
the result ends in a 0 or a 5. That’s because every red number

to be suspicious. But it’s impossible 
for a different reason. Pick a number from each die, 
and add them up. No matter which combination you choose, 
the result ends in a 0 or a 5. That’s because every red number 
is 2 more than a multiple of 5, and every blue number 
is 3 more than a multiple of 5. This means that when you add 
them together, you’ll always get an exact multiple of 5. And when you add rolls 
that are multiples of 5, the result will also be a multiple of 5. These sorts of relationships 
between integers are studied in a branch of math called number theory. Here number theory shows 
us that Draco’s score, which is not a multiple of 5,
cannot be achieved. So he should be disqualified as well. This leaves Alexa, 
whose score is a multiple of 5 and is in the achievable range. In fact, the most likely score is 400, 
so she was a little bit unlucky. But with everyone else disqualified, 
she’s the last heir standing. All hail Queen Alexa, 
the worthiest successor! At least if you agree that the best way 
to organize your government is a roll of the dice...

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Oh the humanity! Ah... humanity... It’s a trainwreck,
but I can’t look away. It’s 1843, and a debate is raging 
among physicians about one of the most common 
killers of women: childbed fever. Childbed fever strikes 
within days of giving birth, killing more than 70% of those infected—
and nobody knows what causes it. Obstetrician Charles Meigs has a theory. Having observed abdominal inflammation in patients who go on 
to develop the fever, he claims this inflammation 
is the cause of childbed fever. Much of the medical establishment
supports his theory. Oh, come on! They really leave me no choice 
but to teach them some skepticism. That’s better. Now, Meigs, your argument is based 
on a fallacy— the false cause fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation: When two phenomena regularly occur
together, one does not necessarily 
cause the other. So you say women who have inflammation
also come down with childbed fever, therefore the inflammation 
caused the fever. But that’s not necessarily true. Yes, yes, the inflammation comes first,
then the fever, so it seems like the inflammation 
causes the fever. But by that logic, since babies 
usually grow hair before teeth, hair growth must cause tooth growth. And we all know that’s not true,
right? Actually, don’t answer that. A couple of different things 
could be going on here. First, it’s possible that fever 
and inflammation are correlated purely by coincidence. Or, there could be a causal relationship
that’s the opposite of what you think— the fever causes the inflammation, rather than the inflammation 
causing the fever. Or both could share a common 
underlying cause you haven’t thought of. If I may, just what do you think 
causes inflammation? Nothing? It just is? Really? Humor me for a moment in discussing
one of your colleague’s ideas— Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. I know, I know, 
you don’t like his theory— you already wrote 
a scathing letter about it. But let’s fill your students in, shall we? Holmes noticed a pattern: 
when a patient dies of childbed fever, a doctor performs an autopsy. If the doctor then treats a new patient, that patient often comes 
down with the fever. Based on this correlation between autopsies of fever victims
and new fever patients, he proposes a possible cause. Since there’s no evidence that the autopsy
causes the fever beyond this correlation, he doesn’t jump to the conclusion 
that autopsy causes fever. Instead, he suggests that doctors 
are infecting their patients via an invisible contaminant 
on their hands and surgical instruments. This idea outrages most doctors, 
who see themselves as infallible. Like Meigs here, who refuses 
to consider the possibility that he’s playing a role 
in his patients’ plight. His flawed argument doesn’t leave any 
path forward for further investigation— but Holmes’ does. It’s 1847, and physician Ignaz Semmelweis has reduced the number 
of childbed fever deaths in a clinic from 12% to 1% 
by requiring all medical personnel to disinfect their hands after autopsies
and between patient examinations. With this initiative, he has proven
the contagious nature of childbed fever. Ha! It’s 1879, and Louis Pasteur 
has identified the contaminant responsible 
for many cases of childbed fever: Hemolytic streptococcus bacteria. Hmm, my fries are cold. Must be because my ice cream melted.

**Transcript**:
Oh the humanity! Ah... humanity... It’s a trainwreck,
but I can’t look away. It’s 1843, and a debate is raging 
among physicians about one of the most common 
killers of women: childbed fever. Childbed fever strikes 
within days of giving birth, killing more than 70% of those infected—
and nobody knows what causes it. Obstetrician Charles Meigs has a theory. Having observed abdominal inflammation in patients who go on 
to develop the fever, he claims this inflammation 
is the cause of childbed fever. Much of the medical establishment
supports his theory. Oh, come on! They really leave me no choice 
but to teach them some skepticism. That’s better. Now, Meigs, your argument is based 
on a fallacy— the false cause fallacy. Correlation does not imply causation: When two phenomena regularly occur
together, one does not necessarily 
cause the other. So you say women who have inflammation
also come down with childbed fever, therefore the inflammation 
caused the fever. But that’s not necessarily true. Yes, yes, the inflammation comes first,
then the fever, so it seems like the inflammation 
causes the fever. But by that logic, since babies 
usually grow hair before teeth, hair growth must cause tooth growth. And we all know that’s not true,
right? Actually, don’t answer that. A couple of different things 
could be going on here. First, it’s possible that fever 
and inflammation are correlated purely by coincidence. Or, there could be a causal relationship
that’s the opposite of what you think— the fever causes the inflammation, rather than the inflammation 
causing the fever. Or both could share a common 
underlying cause you haven’t thought of. If I may, just what do you think 
causes inflammation? Nothing? It just is? Really? Humor me for a moment in discussing
one of your colleague’s ideas— Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes. I know, I know, 
you don’t like his theory— you already wrote 
a scathing letter about it. But let’s fill your students in, shall we? Holmes noticed a pattern: 
when a patient dies of childbed fever, a doctor performs an autopsy. If the doctor then treats a new patient, that patient often comes 
down with the fever. Based on this correlation between autopsies of fever victims
and new fever patients, he proposes a possible cause. Since there’s no evidence that the autopsy
causes the fever beyond this correlation, he doesn’t jump to the conclusion 
that autopsy causes fever. Instead, he suggests that doctors 
are infecting their patients via an invisible contaminant 
on their hands and surgical instruments. This idea outrages most doctors, 
who see themselves as infallible. Like Meigs here, who refuses 
to consider the possibility that he’s playing a role 
in his patients’ plight. His flawed argument doesn’t leave any 
path forward for further investigation— but Holmes’ does. It’s 1847, and physician Ignaz Semmelweis has reduced the number 
of childbed fever deaths in a clinic from 12% to 1% 
by requiring all medical personnel to disinfect their hands after autopsies
and between patient examinations. With this initiative, he has proven
the contagious nature of childbed fever. Ha! It’s 1879, and Louis Pasteur 
has identified the contaminant responsible 
for many cases of childbed fever: Hemolytic streptococcus bacteria. Hmm, my fries are cold. Must be because my ice cream melted.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From Ancient Greece to the 20th century, Aristotle, Sigmund Freud,
and numerous other scholars were all looking for the same thing: eel testicles. Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,
could be found in rivers across Europe, but no one had ever seen them mate. And despite countless dissections, no researcher could find eel eggs
or identify their reproductive organs. Devoid of data, naturalists proposed 
various eel origin stories. Aristotle suggested that eels 
spontaneously emerged from mud. Pliny the Elder argued eels 
rubbed themselves against rocks, and the subsequent scrapings 
came to life. Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,
manifest from the gills of other fish, and even emerge 
from the bodies of beetles. But the true story of eel reproduction
is even more difficult to imagine. And to solve this slippery mystery, scholars would have to rethink 
centuries of research. Today, we know the freshwater eel 
lifecycle has five distinct stages: larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,
adolescent elvers, older yellow eels, and adult silver eels. Given the radical physical differences 
between these phases, you’d be forgiven for assuming 
these are different animals. In fact, that’s exactly what 
European naturalists thought. Researchers were aware of leptocepheli
and glass eels, but no one guessed they were related
to the elvers and yellow eels living hundreds of kilometers upstream. Confusing matters more, eels don’t 
develop sex organs until late in life. And the entirety of their time 
in the rivers of Europe is essentially eel adolescence. So when do eels reproduce, 
and where do they do it? Despite its name, the life 
of a freshwater eel actually begins in the salty waters 
of the Bermuda Triangle. At the height of the annual 
cyclone season, thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae drift out of the Sargasso Sea. From here, they follow migration 
paths to North America and Europe— continents that were 
much closer when eels established these routes 
40 million years ago. Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla
larvae ride the ocean currents 6,500 km to the coast of Europe— making one of the longest 
known marine migrations. By the time they arrive, they’ve grown 
approximately 45 mm, and transformed into semi-transparent 
glass eels. It’s not just their appearance 
that’s changed. If most marine fish entered 
brackish coastal waters, their cells would swell with freshwater
in a lethal explosion. But when glass eels reach the coast, their kidneys shift to retain more salt and maintain their blood’s 
salinity levels. Swarms of these newly freshwater 
fish migrate up streams and rivers, sometimes piling on top of each other
to clear obstacles and predators. Those that make it upstream develop
into opaque elvers. Having finally arrived 
in their hunting grounds, elvers begin to eat everything 
they can fit into their mouths. These omnivores grow in proportion
to their diets, and over the next decade they develop
into larger yellow eels. In this stage, they grow 
to be roughly 80 cm, and finally develop sexual organs. But the last phase of eel life— 
and the secret of their reproduction— remains mysterious. In 1896, researchers identified 
leptocepheli as larval eels, and deduced that they had come 
to Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic. However, to find this mysterious 
breeding ground, someone would have to perform 
an unthinkable survey of the ocean for larvae no larger than 30mm. Enter Johannes Schmidt. For the next 18 years, 
this Danish oceanographer trawled the coasts of four continents, hunting down increasingly 
tiny leptocepheli. Finally, in 1921, he found 
the smallest larvae yet, on the southern edge 
of the Sargasso Sea. Despite knowledge 
of their round trip migration, scientists still haven’t observed 
mating in the wild, or found a single eel egg. Leading theories suggest 
that eels reproduce in a flurry of external fertilization, in which clouds of sperm 
fertilize free-floating eggs. But the powerful currents 
and tangling seaweed of the Sargasso Sea have made this theory 
difficult to confirm. Researchers don’t even know where to look, since they’ve yet to successfully
track an eel over the course of its return migration. Until these challenges can be met, the eel’s ancient secret will continue
to slip through our fingers.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From Ancient Greece to the 20th century, Aristotle, Sigmund Freud,
and numerous other scholars were all looking for the same thing: eel testicles. Freshwater eels, or Anguilla Anguilla,
could be found in rivers across Europe, but no one had ever seen them mate. And despite countless dissections, no researcher could find eel eggs
or identify their reproductive organs. Devoid of data, naturalists proposed 
various eel origin stories. Aristotle suggested that eels 
spontaneously emerged from mud. Pliny the Elder argued eels 
rubbed themselves against rocks, and the subsequent scrapings 
came to life. Eels were said to hatch on rooftops,
manifest from the gills of other fish, and even emerge 
from the bodies of beetles. But the true story of eel reproduction
is even more difficult to imagine. And to solve this slippery mystery, scholars would have to rethink 
centuries of research. Today, we know the freshwater eel 
lifecycle has five distinct stages: larval leptocepheli, miniscule glass eels,
adolescent elvers, older yellow eels, and adult silver eels. Given the radical physical differences 
between these phases, you’d be forgiven for assuming 
these are different animals. In fact, that’s exactly what 
European naturalists thought. Researchers were aware of leptocepheli
and glass eels, but no one guessed they were related
to the elvers and yellow eels living hundreds of kilometers upstream. Confusing matters more, eels don’t 
develop sex organs until late in life. And the entirety of their time 
in the rivers of Europe is essentially eel adolescence. So when do eels reproduce, 
and where do they do it? Despite its name, the life 
of a freshwater eel actually begins in the salty waters 
of the Bermuda Triangle. At the height of the annual 
cyclone season, thousands of three-millimeter eel larvae drift out of the Sargasso Sea. From here, they follow migration 
paths to North America and Europe— continents that were 
much closer when eels established these routes 
40 million years ago. Over the next 300 days, Anguilla Anguilla
larvae ride the ocean currents 6,500 km to the coast of Europe— making one of the longest 
known marine migrations. By the time they arrive, they’ve grown 
approximately 45 mm, and transformed into semi-transparent 
glass eels. It’s not just their appearance 
that’s changed. If most marine fish entered 
brackish coastal waters, their cells would swell with freshwater
in a lethal explosion. But when glass eels reach the coast, their kidneys shift to retain more salt and maintain their blood’s 
salinity levels. Swarms of these newly freshwater 
fish migrate up streams and rivers, sometimes piling on top of each other
to clear obstacles and predators. Those that make it upstream develop
into opaque elvers. Having finally arrived 
in their hunting grounds, elvers begin to eat everything 
they can fit into their mouths. These omnivores grow in proportion
to their diets, and over the next decade they develop
into larger yellow eels. In this stage, they grow 
to be roughly 80 cm, and finally develop sexual organs. But the last phase of eel life— 
and the secret of their reproduction— remains mysterious. In 1896, researchers identified 
leptocepheli as larval eels, and deduced that they had come 
to Europe from somewhere in the Atlantic. However, to find this mysterious 
breeding ground, someone would have to perform 
an unthinkable survey of the ocean for larvae no larger than 30mm. Enter Johannes Schmidt. For the next 18 years, 
this Danish oceanographer trawled the coasts of four continents, hunting down increasingly 
tiny leptocepheli. Finally, in 1921, he found 
the smallest larvae yet, on the southern edge 
of the Sargasso Sea. Despite knowledge

**Transcript**:
In the center of Colchis 
in an enchanted garden, the hide of a mystical flying ram 
hung from the tallest oak, guarded by a dragon who never slept. Jason would have to tread carefully 
to pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches and win back his promised throne. But diplomacy was hardly 
one of the Argonauts’ strengths. Jason would have to navigate 
this difficult task alone. Or so he thought. Leaving most of his bedraggled crew 
to rest, Jason made for the palace with some 
of his more even-tempered men. His first instinct was to simply ask 
the king for his prized possession. But Aeetes was enraged 
at the hero’s presumption. If this outsider wanted his treasure, he would have to prove his worth 
by facing three perilous tasks. The trials would begin the following day, 
and Jason was dismissed to prepare. But another member of the royal family 
was also plotting something. Thanks to the encouragement 
of Jason’s guardians on Mount Olympus, Medea, princess of Colchis 
and priestess of the witch goddess Hecate, had fallen in love with the challenger. She intended to protect her beloved 
from her father’s tricks — at any cost. After a sleepless night, Jason 
somberly marched to the castle— but was intercepted. The princess armed him 
with strange vials and trinkets, in exchange for a promise 
of eternal devotion. As they whispered 
and planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply 
under each other’s spell. Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason 
to face his first task. The hero was brought 
to a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land 
around the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted 
a fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields 
unscathed. For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth 
to plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed
sprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, 
barricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him 
for this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him 
into their midst, the fighters turned on themselves 
as they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray. For the third task, Jason was finally face to face 
with the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree 
and sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations 
reached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, 
the dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed 
to the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece 
off its branch. When the king saw the hero 
sprinting away— not only with the fleece, 
but his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army 
led by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize 
and his conniving daughter home. But all the players in this tale 
had underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran 
his sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces 
of the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father 
while the Argonauts escaped. As Colchis and their pursuers 
grew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return 
to Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act 
had tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them. Buffeted by hostile winds, the wretched crew washed up 
on the island of Circe the sorceress. Medea begged her aunt 
to absolve them of wrongdoing— but bloody deeds 
are not so easily forgotten, and fallen heroes 
not so rapidly redeemed.

**Transcript**:
In the center of Colchis 
in an enchanted garden, the hide of a mystical flying ram 
hung from the tallest oak, guarded by a dragon who never slept. Jason would have to tread carefully 
to pry it from King Aeetes’ clutches and win back his promised throne. But diplomacy was hardly 
one of the Argonauts’ strengths. Jason would have to navigate 
this difficult task alone. Or so he thought. Leaving most of his bedraggled crew 
to rest, Jason made for the palace with some 
of his more even-tempered men. His first instinct was to simply ask 
the king for his prized possession. But Aeetes was enraged 
at the hero’s presumption. If this outsider wanted his treasure, he would have to prove his worth 
by facing three perilous tasks. The trials would begin the following day, 
and Jason was dismissed to prepare. But another member of the royal family 
was also plotting something. Thanks to the encouragement 
of Jason’s guardians on Mount Olympus, Medea, princess of Colchis 
and priestess of the witch goddess Hecate, had fallen in love with the challenger. She intended to protect her beloved 
from her father’s tricks — at any cost. After a sleepless night, Jason 
somberly marched to the castle— but was intercepted. The princess armed him 
with strange vials and trinkets, in exchange for a promise 
of eternal devotion. As they whispered 
and planned their victory, both hero and princess fell deeply 
under each other’s spell. Unaware of his daughter’s scheming, the king confidently led Jason 
to face his first task. The hero was brought 
to a huge field of oxen that lay between him and the fleece, and told that he had to plough the land 
around the crowds of oxen. A simple task— or so Jason thought. But Medea had concocted 
a fire-proof ointment, and so he plowed the flickering fields 
unscathed. For the second task, he was given a box of serpent’s teeth 
to plant into the scorched earth. As soon as Jason scattered them, each seed
sprouted into a bloodthirsty warrior. They burst up around him, 
barricading his way forward, but Medea had prepared him 
for this task as well. Hurling a heavy stone she had given him 
into their midst, the fighters turned on themselves 
as they scrabbled for it, letting him slip by the fray. For the third task, Jason was finally face to face 
with the guardian of the Fleece. Dodging sharp claws and singeing breath, Jason scrambled up the tree 
and sprinkled a sweet-smelling concoction over the dragon. As the strains of Medea’s incantations 
reached its ears and the potion settled in its eyes, 
the dragon sank into a deep sleep. Elated, Jason climbed 
to the top of the tallest oak, where he slipped the gleaming fleece 
off its branch. When the king saw the hero 
sprinting away— not only with the fleece, 
but his daughter in tow— he realized he had been betrayed. Furious, he sent an army 
led by his son Absyrtus to bring the ill-gotten prize 
and his conniving daughter home. But all the players in this tale 
had underestimated the viciousness of these disgraced lovers. To the horror of the Gods, Jason ran 
his sword through Absyrtus in cold blood. Medea then helped him scatter pieces 
of the body along the shore, distracting her grieving father 
while the Argonauts escaped. As Colchis and their pursuers 
grew smaller on the horizon, a solemn silence fell aboard the Argo. Jason could now return 
to Thessaly victorious— but his terrible act 
had tarnished his crew’s honor, and turned the Gods against them. Buffeted by hostile winds, the wretched crew washed up 
on the island of Circe the sorceress. Medea begged her aunt 
to absolve them of wrongdoing— but bloody deeds 
are not so easily forgotten, and fallen heroes 
not so rapidly redeemed.

**Transcript**:
One summer evening in 335 BCE, 
Alexander the Great was resting by the Danube River after 
a day of fighting the Scythian tribes when a band of strangers 
approached his camp. Alexander had never seen anything 
like these tall, fierce-looking warriors with huge 
golden neck rings and colorful cloaks— so he invited them to feast with him. They proudly said they were Keltoi 
or Celts who came from the far-away Alps. Alexander asked what they feared 
the most in the world, hoping they would say him. They laughed and said they feared 
nothing at all. This is one of the earliest stories 
about the ancient Celts. While we don’t know 
where the first Celts came from, by Alexander’s time 
they had spread across Europe from Asia Minor in the east to Spain and the Atlantic islands of Britain 
and Ireland in the west. The Celts were never one unified empire,
and they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent
tribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king 
and religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought 
their enemies. Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, 
the Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth 
to live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed 
to their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, 
scoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior
could possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads 
in jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests 
who visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued 
in the ancient world that foreign kings often hired 
them as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies. But the Celts were much more 
than just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen,
artists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds 
of their ancestors and praised the accomplishments
of warrior kings— and composed biting satires 
about cowardly or selfish leaders. The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids 
oversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years 
of study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record
any of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices 
and sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, 
judges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could
step between warring tribes in the middle of a battle 
and call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid,
or question their decisions. In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans 
began to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman 
legions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained 
their tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar 
marched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies 
to turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite 
against their common enemy under the leadership 
of king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families 
died or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France. Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland
were the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe 
in a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving 
the Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle 
against the enemy. By the end of the 1st century CE, 
Ireland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts 
survived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins.

any of their teachings in writing. Druids supervised religious practices 
and sacrifices to the gods, but they were also teachers, healers, 
judges, and scientists. They were so respected that they could
step between warring tribes in the middle of a battle 
and call an end to the fighting. No Celt would dare to harm a druid,
or question their decisions. In the 2nd century BCE, the Romans 
began to encroach on Celtic territory, conquering the tribes of northern Italy. Rather than unite against the Roman 
legions in response to this defeat, the Celts maintained 
their tribal divisions. The tribes of Spain fell soon after. In the 1st century BCE, Julius Caesar 
marched his armies across France, using bribery, threats, and lies 
to turn tribes against each other. Only in the closing days of this great war did the Celts unite 
against their common enemy under the leadership 
of king Vercingetorix, but it was too late. Countless warriors and their families 
died or were enslaved as the Romans conquered France. Protected by the surrounding waters, the Celtic tribes of Britain and Ireland
were the last holdouts. When the Romans finally invaded Britain, the queen Boudicca united her tribe 
in a revolt after her husband was killed. She almost succeeded in driving 
the Roman legions out of Britain before dying as she led a final battle 
against the enemy. By the end of the 1st century CE, 
Ireland alone, far out at sea, remained unconquered by Rome. There, the ways of the ancient Celts 
survived untouched by the outside world long after Rome itself lay in ruins.

**Transcript**:
One summer evening in 335 BCE, 
Alexander the Great was resting by the Danube River after 
a day of fighting the Scythian tribes when a band of strangers 
approached his camp. Alexander had never seen anything 
like these tall, fierce-looking warriors with huge 
golden neck rings and colorful cloaks— so he invited them to feast with him. They proudly said they were Keltoi 
or Celts who came from the far-away Alps. Alexander asked what they feared 
the most in the world, hoping they would say him. They laughed and said they feared 
nothing at all. This is one of the earliest stories 
about the ancient Celts. While we don’t know 
where the first Celts came from, by Alexander’s time 
they had spread across Europe from Asia Minor in the east to Spain and the Atlantic islands of Britain 
and Ireland in the west. The Celts were never one unified empire,
and they didn’t build cities or monuments. Instead, they were hundreds of independent
tribes who spoke the same language. Each had its own warrior-king 
and religious center. The tribes fought each other as enthusiastically as they fought 
their enemies. Few armies could stand up to them. Somewhat unusually for the time, 
the Celts believed in reincarnation— that they would be reborn on Earth 
to live and feast and fight again, which may have contributed 
to their fearlessness in battle. Some of them fought naked, 
scoffing at their enemies’ armor. The greatest trophy a Celtic warrior
could possess was the severed head of a foe. They preserved these heads 
in jars of cedar oil and showed them to guests 
who visited their homes. Celtic warriors were so valued 
in the ancient world that foreign kings often hired 
them as mercenary soldiers to serve in their armies. But the Celts were much more 
than just warriors. Among them were many skilled craftsmen,
artists, and great poets called bards. The bards sang of the brave deeds 
of their ancestors and praised the accomplishments
of warrior kings— and composed biting satires 
about cowardly or selfish leaders. The Celts worshipped many gods, and priests known as druids 
oversaw this worship. Anyone could become a druid, but the training required many years 
of study and memorization— the druids were not allowed to record

**Transcript**:
It was a feast like Egypt 
had never seen before. The warrior god Set and his wife, 
the goddess Nephtys, decorated an extravagant hall 
for the occasion, with a beautiful wooden chest 
as the centerpiece. They invited all the most important gods,
dozens of lesser deities, and foreign monarchs. But no one caused as big a stir as Set 
and Nephtys’s older brother Osiris, the god who ruled all of Egypt 
and had brought prosperity to everyone. Set announced a game— whoever could fit perfectly in the chest
could have it as a gift. One by one, the guests clambered in,
but no one fit. Finally, it was Osiris’s turn. As he lay down, everyone could see
it was a perfect fit— another win for the god 
who could do no wrong. Then Set slammed the lid down 
with Osiris still inside, sealed it shut, and tossed it into the Nile. The chest was a coffin. Set had constructed it specifically 
to trap his brother and planned the party to lure him into it. Set had long been jealous 
of his brother’s successful reign, and hoped to replace 
him as the ruler of all Egypt. The Nile bore the coffin out to sea 
and it drifted for many days before washing ashore near Byblos, 
where a great cedar grew around it. The essence of the god within 
gave the tree a divine aura, and when the king of Byblos noticed it, he ordered the tree cut down
and brought to his palace. Unbeknownst to him, the coffin containing Egypt’s 
most powerful god was still inside. Set’s victory seemed complete, 
but he hadn’t counted on his sisters. Set’s wife Nephtys was also his sister, while their other sister, 
the goddess Isis, was married to their brother Osiris. Isis was determined to find Osiris, and enlisted Nephtys’s help 
behind Set’s back. The two sisters took the shape 
of falcons and travelled far and wide. Some children who had seen 
the coffin float by pointed them to the palace of Byblos. Isis adopted a new disguise 
and approached the palace. The queen was so charmed 
by the disguised goddess that she entrusted her 
with nursing the baby prince. Isis decided to make the child immortal 
by bathing him in flame. When the horrified queen 
came upon this scene, Isis revealed herself 
and demanded the tree. When she cut the coffin from the trunk
and opened it, Osiris was dead inside. Weeping, she carried his body 
back to Egypt and hid it in a swamp, while she set off in search 
of a means of resurrecting him. But while she was gone, Set found the body 
and cut it into many pieces, scattering them throughout Egypt. Isis had lost Osiris for the second time,
but she did not give up. She searched all over the land,
traveling in a boat of papyrus. One by one, she tracked down 
the parts of her husband’s dismembered body
in every province of Egypt, holding a funeral for each piece. At long last, she had recovered
every piece but one— his penis, 
which a fish in the Nile had eaten. Working with what she had, Isis 
reconstructed and revived her husband. But without his penis, 
Osiris was incomplete. He could not remain among the living, could not return to his old position 
as ruler of Egypt. Instead, he would have to rule over Duat,
the realm of the dead. Before he went, though, he and Isis 
conceived a son to bear Osiris’s legacy— and one day, avenge him.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It was a feast like Egypt 
had never seen before. The warrior god Set and his wife, 
the goddess Nephtys, decorated an extravagant hall 
for the occasion, with a beautiful wooden chest 
as the centerpiece. They invited all the most important gods,
dozens of lesser deities, and foreign monarchs. But no one caused as big a stir as Set 
and Nephtys’s older brother Osiris, the god who ruled all of Egypt 
and had brought prosperity to everyone. Set announced a game— whoever could fit perfectly in the chest
could have it as a gift. One by one, the guests clambered in,
but no one fit. Finally, it was Osiris’s turn. As he lay down, everyone could see
it was a perfect fit— another win for the god 
who could do no wrong. Then Set slammed the lid down 
with Osiris still inside, sealed it shut, and tossed it into the Nile. The chest was a coffin. Set had constructed it specifically 
to trap his brother and planned the party to lure him into it. Set had long been jealous 
of his brother’s successful reign, and hoped to replace 
him as the ruler of all Egypt. The Nile bore the coffin out to sea 
and it drifted for many days before washing ashore near Byblos, 
where a great cedar grew around it. The essence of the god within 
gave the tree a divine aura, and when the king of Byblos noticed it, he ordered the tree cut down
and brought to his palace. Unbeknownst to him, the coffin containing Egypt’s 
most powerful god was still inside. Set’s victory seemed complete, 
but he hadn’t counted on his sisters. Set’s wife Nephtys was also his sister, while their other sister, 
the goddess Isis, was married to their brother Osiris. Isis was determined to find Osiris, and enlisted Nephtys’s help 
behind Set’s back. The two sisters took the shape 
of falcons and travelled far and wide. Some children who had seen 
the coffin float by pointed them to the palace of Byblos. Isis adopted a new disguise 
and approached the palace. The queen was so charmed 
by the disguised goddess that she entrusted her 
with nursing the baby prince. Isis decided to make the child immortal 
by bathing him in flame. When the horrified queen 
came upon this scene, Isis revealed herself 
and demanded the tree. When she cut the coffin from the trunk
and opened it, Osiris was dead inside. Weeping, she carried his body 
back to Egypt and hid it in a swamp, while she set off in search 
of a means of resurrecting him. But while she was gone, Set found the body 
and cut it into many pieces, scattering them throughout Egypt. Isis had lost Osiris for the second time,
but she did not give up. She searched all over the land,
traveling in a boat of papyrus. One by one, she tracked down 
the parts of her husband’s dismembered body
in every province of Egypt, holding a funeral for each piece. At long last, she had recovered
every piece but one— his penis, 
which a fish in the Nile had eaten. Working with what she had, Isis 
reconstructed and revived her husband. But without his penis, 
Osiris was incomplete. He could not remain among the living, could not return to his old position 
as ruler of Egypt. Instead, he would have to rule over Duat,
the realm of the dead. Before he went, though, he and Isis 
conceived a son to bear Osiris’s legacy— and one day, avenge him.

**Transcript**:
In the sun-dappled streets 
of a small town, a proud mother 
showed off her newborn son. Upon noticing his lucky birthmark, townsfolk predicted 
he would marry a princess. But soon, these rumors reached the ears 
of the wicked king. Enraged, the king stole the child away, 
and sent him hurtling down the river. But the infant’s luck proved greater 
than the king’s plan. Years later, the king 
was traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man 
with an uncanny birthmark. After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy 
with a letter for the queen. The youth eagerly set out 
to deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying 
his own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits 
stumbled upon his camp. Yet when they read the brutal letter, 
they were filled with pity. Deciding to make trouble for the king 
instead, they scribbled a new note. As soon as the youth 
arrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess. The two felt destined for each other. And when the queen read 
that the king approved this union, she joyfully organized 
a whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, 
he was furious. But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s 
beloved without reason. So he devised a diabolical trial. He ordered the youth 
to travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs 
freshly plucked from the Devil’s head. Only upon succeeding 
could he return to his bride. The youth searched across the land 
for the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached 
an eerie village. Here, he saw some villagers 
gathered around a well. They closed in on the youth, 
refusing to let him pass until he answered their question: 
why was the well dry? The youth replied, 
“I will answer when I return.” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set 
of villagers contemplating a gnarled tree. They refused to let him pass 
until he answered their question: why was the tree barren? Again, the youth responded, 
“I will answer when I return." These villagers guided him to the dock, 
where an elderly ferryman awaited. As he paddled through the black water, 
the ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task? Once more, the youth promised, 
“I will answer when I return.” At last, they reached a hut sinking 
into the swampy banks of Hell. Reluctantly, the youth knocked 
on the rotting door. The devil’s grandmother 
answered his call. She was known to help some visiting souls,
and harm others. The youth had just finished his story 
when they heard the devil’s footsteps. Without warning, 
the boy’s world appeared to shrink. The devil’s grandmother lifted him 
into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson. The old woman set to work, 
lavishing the devil with food and drink. When he fell asleep, she deftly plucked 
three gleaming hairs from his head. With each plucked hair, the Devil briefly 
awoke and complained about his dreams, full of nearby villagers 
and their problems. The next morning, the youth departed— armed with three golden hairs, 
and three pieces of information. He shared the devil’s first dream 
with the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars 
to a willing passenger, he would be free from his task. Back at the village, the youth declared 
that there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, 
and an enormous toad blocking the well. The villagers rewarded him handsomely 
for his help. Back from his journey, the youth thrust 
the devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law 
only had eyes for the gold. The sly youth told the king 
that even greater wealth awaited him across the river. Immediately, the king 
hastened to the riverbank. Eager to claim his riches, he held out his hands impatiently 
to the grinning ferryman— who happily handed over his oars.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the sun-dappled streets 
of a small town, a proud mother 
showed off her newborn son. Upon noticing his lucky birthmark, townsfolk predicted 
he would marry a princess. But soon, these rumors reached the ears 
of the wicked king. Enraged, the king stole the child away, 
and sent him hurtling down the river. But the infant’s luck proved greater 
than the king’s plan. Years later, the king 
was traveling his realm, when he spotted a strapping young man 
with an uncanny birthmark. After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy 
with a letter for the queen. The youth eagerly set out 
to deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying 
his own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits 
stumbled upon his camp. Yet when they read the brutal letter, 
they were filled with pity. Deciding to make trouble for the king 
instead, they scribbled a new note. As soon as the youth 
arrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess. The two felt destined for each other. And when the queen read 
that the king approved this union, she joyfully organized 
a whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, 
he was furious. But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s 
beloved without reason. So he devised a diabolical trial. He ordered the youth 
to travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs 
freshly plucked from the Devil’s head. Only upon succeeding 
could he return to his bride. The youth searched across the land 
for the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached 
an eerie village. Here, he saw some villagers 
gathered around a well. They closed in on the youth, 
refusing to let him pass until he answered their question: 
why was the well dry? The youth replied, 
“I will answer when I return.” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set 
of villagers contemplating a gnarled tree. They refused to let him pass 
until he answered their question: why was the tree barren? Again, the youth responded, 
“I will answer when I return." These villagers guided him to the dock, 
where an elderly ferryman awaited. As he paddled through the black water, 
the ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task? Once more, the youth promised, 
“I will answer when I return.” At last, they reached a hut sinking 
into the swampy banks of Hell. Reluctantly, the youth knocked 
on the rotting door. The devil’s grandmother 
answered his call. She was known to help some visiting souls,
and harm others. The youth had just finished his story 
when they heard the devil’s footsteps. Without warning, 
the boy’s world appeared to shrink. The devil’s grandmother lifted him 
into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson. The old woman set to work, 
lavishing the devil with food and drink. When he fell asleep, she deftly plucked 
three gleaming hairs from his head. With each plucked hair, the Devil briefly 
awoke and complained about his dreams, full of nearby villagers 
and their problems. The next morning, the youth departed— armed with three golden hairs, 
and three pieces of information. He shared the devil’s first dream 
with the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars 
to a willing passenger, he would be free from his task. Back at the village, the youth declared 
that there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, 
and an enormous toad blocking the well. The villagers rewarded him handsomely 
for his help. Back from his journey, the youth thrust 
the devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law 
only had eyes for the gold. The sly youth told the king 
that even greater wealth awaited him across the river. Immediately, the king 
hastened to the riverbank. Eager to claim his riches, he held out his hands impatiently 
to the grinning ferryman— who happily handed over his oars.

with an uncanny birthmark. After confirming the child’s origins, the sly king entrusted the boy 
with a letter for the queen. The youth eagerly set out 
to deliver the message— not knowing he was carrying 
his own death sentence. That night, roaming bandits 
stumbled upon his camp. Yet when they read the brutal letter, 
they were filled with pity. Deciding to make trouble for the king 
instead, they scribbled a new note. As soon as the youth 
arrived at the palace, he locked eyes with the princess. The two felt destined for each other. And when the queen read 
that the king approved this union, she joyfully organized 
a whirlwind wedding. When the king returned, 
he was furious. But he couldn’t execute his daughter’s 
beloved without reason. So he devised a diabolical trial. He ordered the youth 
to travel to Hell itself, and return with three golden hairs 
freshly plucked from the Devil’s head. Only upon succeeding 
could he return to his bride. The youth searched across the land 
for the entrance to Hell, until he finally reached 
an eerie village. Here, he saw some villagers 
gathered around a well. They closed in on the youth, 
refusing to let him pass until he answered their question: 
why was the well dry? The youth replied, 
“I will answer when I return.” They directed him further into town, where he came across another set 
of villagers contemplating a gnarled tree. They refused to let him pass 
until he answered their question: why was the tree barren? Again, the youth responded, 
“I will answer when I return." These villagers guided him to the dock, 
where an elderly ferryman awaited. As he paddled through the black water, 
the ferryman rasped a third question: how can I escape my interminable task? Once more, the youth promised, 
“I will answer when I return.” At last, they reached a hut sinking 
into the swampy banks of Hell. Reluctantly, the youth knocked 
on the rotting door. The devil’s grandmother 
answered his call. She was known to help some visiting souls,
and harm others. The youth had just finished his story 
when they heard the devil’s footsteps. Without warning, 
the boy’s world appeared to shrink. The devil’s grandmother lifted him 
into the folds of her sleeve, and welcomed her grandson. The old woman set to work, 
lavishing the devil with food and drink. When he fell asleep, she deftly plucked 
three gleaming hairs from his head. With each plucked hair, the Devil briefly 
awoke and complained about his dreams, full of nearby villagers 
and their problems. The next morning, the youth departed— armed with three golden hairs, 
and three pieces of information. He shared the devil’s first dream 
with the ferryman. If the boatman could hand his oars 
to a willing passenger, he would be free from his task. Back at the village, the youth declared 
that there was a mouse gnawing at the root of the tree, 
and an enormous toad blocking the well. The villagers rewarded him handsomely 
for his help. Back from his journey, the youth thrust 
the devil’s hairs at the king— but his greedy father-in-law 
only had eyes for the gold. The sly youth told the king 
that even greater wealth awaited him across the river. Immediately, the king 
hastened to the riverbank. Eager to claim his riches, he held out his hands impatiently 
to the grinning ferryman— who happily handed over his oars.

**Transcript**:
When Nicolas Bourbaki applied 
to the American Mathematical Society in the 1950s, he was already one of the most influential
mathematicians of his time. He’d published articles 
in international journals and his textbooks were required reading. Yet his application was firmly rejected 
for one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist. Two decades earlier, 
mathematics was in disarray. Many established mathematicians had lost 
their lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented. Different branches used disparate 
methodology to pursue their own goals. And the lack of a shared 
mathematical language made it difficult to share 
or expand their work. In 1934, a group of French mathematicians 
were particularly fed up. While studying at the prestigious 
École normale supérieure, they found the textbook 
for their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one. The small group 
quickly took on new members, and as the project grew, 
so did their ambition. The result was 
the "Éléments de mathématique," a treatise that sought to create 
a consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics. The text began 
with a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use 
to build its argument. From there, its authors derived 
more and more complex theorems that corresponded with work 
being done across the field. But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify 
consistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems. To accomplish this, they gave new, 
clear definitions to some of the most important 
mathematical objects, including the function. It’s reasonable to think of functions 
as machines that accept inputs and produce an output. But if we think of functions 
as bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about 
the logical relationships between them. For example, consider a group of numbers
and a group of letters. We could define a function where 
every numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish 
a particularly interesting relationship. Alternatively, we could define a function 
where every numerical input corresponds to a different 
alphabetical output. This second function sets up 
a logical relationship where performing a process on the input 
has corresponding effects on its mapped output. The group began to define functions by how
they mapped elements across domains. If a function’s output came 
from a unique input, they defined it as injective. If every output can be mapped 
onto at least one input, the function was surjective. And in bijective functions, each element 
had perfect one to one correspondence. This allowed mathematicians to establish 
logic that could be translated across the function’s domains 
in both directions. Their systematic approach 
to abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular 
belief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic 
constrained creativity. But this rebellious band of scholars 
gleefully ignored conventional wisdom. They were revolutionizing the field, 
and they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet. They decided to publish 
"Éléments de mathématique" and all their subsequent work 
under a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s 
publications became standard references. And the group’s members took their prank 
as seriously as their work. Their invented mathematician claimed 
to be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet 
with his selected collaborators. They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, 
announced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone 
who doubted his existence. In 1968, when they could 
no longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke 
the only way they could. They printed Bourbaki’s obituary,
complete with mathematical puns. Despite his apparent death, the group 
bearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated 
with any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs 
much current research. And the modern emphasis on formal proofs
owes a great deal to his rigorous methods. Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— 
but his legacy is very real.

**Transcript**:
When Nicolas Bourbaki applied 
to the American Mathematical Society in the 1950s, he was already one of the most influential
mathematicians of his time. He’d published articles 
in international journals and his textbooks were required reading. Yet his application was firmly rejected 
for one simple reason— Nicolas Bourbaki did not exist. Two decades earlier, 
mathematics was in disarray. Many established mathematicians had lost 
their lives in the first World War, and the field had become fragmented. Different branches used disparate 
methodology to pursue their own goals. And the lack of a shared 
mathematical language made it difficult to share 
or expand their work. In 1934, a group of French mathematicians 
were particularly fed up. While studying at the prestigious 
École normale supérieure, they found the textbook 
for their calculus class so disjointed that they decided to write a better one. The small group 
quickly took on new members, and as the project grew, 
so did their ambition. The result was 
the "Éléments de mathématique," a treatise that sought to create 
a consistent logical framework unifying every branch of mathematics. The text began 
with a set of simple axioms— laws and assumptions it would use 
to build its argument. From there, its authors derived 
more and more complex theorems that corresponded with work 
being done across the field. But to truly reveal common ground, the group needed to identify 
consistent rules that applied to a wide range of problems. To accomplish this, they gave new, 
clear definitions to some of the most important 
mathematical objects, including the function. It’s reasonable to think of functions 
as machines that accept inputs and produce an output. But if we think of functions 
as bridges between two groups, we can start to make claims about 
the logical relationships between them. For example, consider a group of numbers
and a group of letters. We could define a function where 
every numerical input corresponds to the same alphabetical output, but this doesn’t establish 
a particularly interesting relationship. Alternatively, we could define a function 
where every numerical input corresponds to a different 
alphabetical output. This second function sets up 
a logical relationship where performing a process on the input 
has corresponding effects on its mapped output. The group began to define functions by how
they mapped elements across domains. If a function’s output came 
from a unique input, they defined it as injective. If every output can be mapped 
onto at least one input, the function was surjective. And in bijective functions, each element 
had perfect one to one correspondence. This allowed mathematicians to establish 
logic that could be translated across the function’s domains 
in both directions. Their systematic approach 
to abstract principles was in stark contrast to the popular 
belief that math was an intuitive science, and an over-dependence on logic 
constrained creativity. But this rebellious band of scholars 
gleefully ignored conventional wisdom. They were revolutionizing the field, 
and they wanted to mark the occasion with their biggest stunt yet. They decided to publish 
"Éléments de mathématique" and all their subsequent work 
under a collective pseudonym: Nicolas Bourbaki. Over the next two decades, Bourbaki’s 
publications became standard references. And the group’s members took their prank 
as seriously as their work. Their invented mathematician claimed 
to be a reclusive Russian genius who would only meet 
with his selected collaborators. They sent telegrams in Bourbaki’s name, 
announced his daughter’s wedding, and publicly insulted anyone 
who doubted his existence. In 1968, when they could 
no longer maintain the ruse, the group ended their joke 
the only way they could. They printed Bourbaki’s obituary,
complete with mathematical puns. Despite his apparent death, the group 
bearing Bourbaki’s name lives on today. Though he’s not associated 
with any single major discovery, Bourbaki’s influence informs 
much current research. And the modern emphasis on formal proofs
owes a great deal to his rigorous methods. Nicolas Bourbaki may have been imaginary— 
but his legacy is very real.

Hi I'm Ellie and these a four of my
favourite things. Bananas, my red coat, tomato soup and comic books. But what do they all
have in common? Two little words, pop and art. Pop art is more
than an art movement, it's a lifestyle, a craze, a way of looking at the world. But
what is pop art? Pop is young, bold and fun! This is life in the 40s
 it's a bit grey In the 50s, people wanted plastic and
glamour. They wanted to have a good time Buy more, spend more.
Don't just watch TV, be on TV now you can listen to The Beatles and Elvis 
watch cartoons, eat popcorn, drive cars and become famous. Now it was pop art all
about culture. After all pop art means popular art. Art for all. But who were the
pop artists? Richard Hamilton, this guy. said pop art is low cost, young, witty,
glamorous and mass-produced Hamilton made collages using imagery he
found in glossy magazines, lifting images from films and advertising was
completely bonkers at the time This is one of the famous Marilyn portraits by
Andy Warhol. Who? Andy, Andy Warhol This guy. See? A cool guy. For Andy art was a
project. The same as a production line of coca-cola bottles or Campbell's Soup. He liked to use bright colours and silk screening techniques to produce art on a huge scale Pretty clever, I'd say. Pop art is
revolutionary! pop artists were competitive who could do what first? Warhol had his advertising Lichtenstein had his comic books Paolozzi had his collage and Minnie Mouse Wait, let's go back to Lichtenstein. He used Ben Day dots to make his artwork look like comics like the ones you get in
newspapers. Female artists were also rocking the pop art trend. This is 'The Only Blonde in the World' 
by English painter Pauline Boty. Pauline added fun
into her art and was a bit of rebel Girl power Pauline! Pop art came out of the gallery too Nicola L took this big red coat around the world
to get people to get involved with her performance. This made a real pop crowd
not the celebrity faces in other forms of pop art Pop art can also be found all
over the world In Iran Parviz Tanavoli  was a sculptor and painter Like other pop artists he made his art out of things that were
like they could be thrown away in New York Jean-Michel Basquiat remixed it

**Transcript**:
Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with 
an infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start 
to communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky 
proposed a theory based on the observation that the key 
to this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure 
of an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are 
grammatical rules that apply to all languages,
and that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process
language according to these rules. He labelled this faculty 
universal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry 
that shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field 
of cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers 
set out to investigate the two main components 
of universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, 
grammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules 
are hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish 
the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool
known as generative syntax, which represents the order of words 
in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest 
a grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data, 
it quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear 
outside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates 
a major problem: it takes a lot of data 
from each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages 
might have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume 
of recorded samples necessary to analyze them 
using generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language
is incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still
haven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data 
was gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages 
around the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were 
universal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate 
this variation. According to his new hypothesis 
of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain 
grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, 
or the application of these principles. For example, a principle is 
“every sentence must have a subject," but the parameter of whether the subject
must be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles 
and parameters still didn’t answer the question of which
grammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested 
that there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures
can be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence 
within a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds 
a noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate 
for a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists 
published findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have 
any recursive structures. So what about the other part 
of Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically 
determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm, 
called behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal 
and human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside 
by the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism 
was wrong, and there is underlying, 
genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology 
responsible for language is also responsible for other 
aspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated,
innate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar
prompted the documentation and study of many languages 
that hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be 
reevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing 
understanding of the human brain.

**Transcript**:
Language is endlessly variable. Each of us can come up with 
an infinite number of sentences in our native language, and we’re able to do so from an early age— almost as soon as we start 
to communicate in sentences. How is this possible? In the early 1950s, Noam Chomsky 
proposed a theory based on the observation that the key 
to this versatility seems to be grammar: the familiar grammatical structure 
of an unfamiliar sentence points us toward its meaning. He suggested that there are 
grammatical rules that apply to all languages,
and that the rules are innate— the human brain is hardwired to process
language according to these rules. He labelled this faculty 
universal grammar, and it launched lines of inquiry 
that shaped both the field of linguistics and the emerging field 
of cognitive science for decades to come. Chomsky and other researchers 
set out to investigate the two main components 
of universal grammar: first, whether there are, in fact, 
grammar rules that are universal to all languages, and, second, whether these rules 
are hardwired in the brain. In attempts to establish 
the universal rules of grammar, Chomsky developed an analytical tool
known as generative syntax, which represents the order of words 
in a sentence in hierarchical syntax trees that show what structures are possible. Based on this tree, we could suggest 
a grammar rule that adverbs must occur in verb phrases. But with more data, 
it quickly becomes clear that adverbs can appear 
outside of verb phrases. This simplified example illustrates 
a major problem: it takes a lot of data 
from each individual language to establish the rules for that language, before we can even begin to determine which rules all languages 
might have in common. When Chomsky proposed universal grammar, many languages lacked the volume 
of recorded samples necessary to analyze them 
using generative syntax. Even with lots of data, mapping the structure of a language
is incredibly complex. After 50 years of analysis, we still
haven’t completely figured out English. As more linguist data 
was gathered and analyzed, it became clear that languages 
around the world differ widely, challenging the theory that there were 
universal grammar rules. In the 1980s, Chomsky revised his theory in an attempt to accommodate 
this variation. According to his new hypothesis 
of principles and parameters, all languages shared certain 
grammatical principles, but could vary in their parameters, 
or the application of these principles. For example, a principle is 
“every sentence must have a subject," but the parameter of whether the subject
must be explicitly stated could vary between languages. The hypothesis of principles 
and parameters still didn’t answer the question of which
grammatical principles are universal. In the early 2000s, Chomsky suggested 
that there’s just one shared principle, called recursion, which means structures
can be nested inside each other. Take this sentence, which embeds a sentence within a sentence 
within a sentence. Or this sentence, which embeds 
a noun phrase in a noun phrase in a noun phrase. Recursion was a good candidate 
for a universal grammar rule because it can take many forms. However, in 2005 linguists 
published findings on an Amazonian language called Piraha, which doesn’t appear to have 
any recursive structures. So what about the other part 
of Chomsky’s theory, that our language faculty is innate? When he first proposed universal grammar, the idea that there was a genetically 
determined aspect of language acquisition had a profound, revolutionary impact. It challenged the dominant paradigm, 
called behaviorism. Behaviorists argued that all animal 
and human behaviors, including language, were acquired from the outside 
by the mind, which starts out as a blank slate. Today, scientists agree that behaviorism 
was wrong, and there is underlying, 
genetically encoded biological machinery for language learning. Many think the same biology 
responsible for language is also responsible for other 
aspects of cognition. So they disagree with Chomsky’s idea that there is a specific, isolated,
innate language faculty in the brain. The theory of universal grammar
prompted the documentation and study of many languages 
that hadn’t been studied before. It also caused an old idea to be 
reevaluated and eventually overthrown to make room for our growing 
understanding of the human brain.

**Transcript**:
“I am an invisible man.” “Mrs. Dalloway said she would 
buy the flowers herself.” “You are about to begin reading 
Italo Calvino's new novel.” These three opening lines, 
from Ralph Ellison’s "Invisible Man," Virginia Woolf’s "Mrs. Dalloway," and Italo Calvino’s 
"If on a winter’s night a traveler," each establish a different point of view. Who is telling a story, 
and from what perspective, are some of the most important choices 
an author makes. Told from a different point of view, 
a story can transform completely. Take this fairytale: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,"
the Prince called, "let down your hair." Rapunzel unbraided her hair 
and slung it out the window. The prince climbed her tresses 
into the tower. Rapunzel is typically told like this, 
with the narrator outside the story. This point of view is called third person. But Rapunzel can also be told 
by a character in the story— a first person narrator. The tail end of Rapunzel’s locks 
plopped down at my feet. I grabbed on and began to climb… ugh! I couldn’t untangle myself. Strands came off all over me, 
sticking to my sweat. In a first person narrative, the story 
can change dramatically depending on which character
is the narrator. Say Rapunzel was narrating 
instead of the prince: I hope he appreciates how long it takes 
to unbraid 25 feet of hair, I thought. OUCH! I'll be honest; I thought my scalp
would stretch off of my skull. "Can you climb any faster?" I yelled. In second person, the narrator addresses 
the story to the reader: He calls your name. He wants you 
to let your hair down. You just finished braiding it, but hey–
you don't get a lot of visitors. Third person, first person, 
and second person perspectives each have unique possibilities
and constraints. So how do you choose a point 
of view for your story? Constraints aren’t necessarily 
a bad thing— they can help focus a story 
or highlight certain elements. For example, a third person narrator is necessarily
a bit removed from the characters. But that can be good for stories 
where a feeling of distance is important. A third person narrator 
can be either limited, meaning they stick close to one 
character’s thoughts and feelings, or they can be omniscient, 
able to flit between characters’ minds and give the reader more information. A first person story creates closeness 
between the reader and the narrator. It’s also restricted 
by the narrator’s knowledge. This can create suspense as the reader finds out information
along with the character. A first person narrator 
doesn’t necessarily have to represent the character’s 
experience faithfully— they can be delusional or dishonest. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel 
"The Remains of the Day," Stevens, an aging British butler in 1956, 
recounts his many years of service, but fails to acknowledge the flaws 
of the man he serves. The cracks in his narrative eventually 
draw the reader’s attention to the under-acknowledged failings 
of the culture and class system he inhabits. Justin Torres’s novel, "We the Animals," begins with a plural 
first person narrator: “We were six snatching hands, 
six stomping feet; we were brothers, boys, three little kings
locked in a feud for more.” Partway through the story, 
the point of view shifts to first person singular,
from we to I, as the boys come of age and one brother feels alienated
from the others. Second person is a less common choice. It requires the writer to make the reader
suspend disbelief to become another “you.” Placing the reader 
in a character’s perspective can build urgency and suspense. Sometimes, though, second person is intended to distance 
the narrator from their own story, rather than bring the reader closer 
to the story. In these cases, second person narrators refer 
to themselves as “you” rather than “I.” Writers are constantly experimenting 
with fresh variations on point of view. New virtual and augmented 
reality technologies may expand the possibilities
for this experimentation. By placing people at a particular 
vantage point in virtual space, how might we change the way 
we tell and experience stories?

buy the flowers herself.” “You are about to begin reading 
Italo Calvino's new novel.” These three opening lines, 
from Ralph Ellison’s "Invisible Man," Virginia Woolf’s "Mrs. Dalloway," and Italo Calvino’s 
"If on a winter’s night a traveler," each establish a different point of view. Who is telling a story, 
and from what perspective, are some of the most important choices 
an author makes. Told from a different point of view, 
a story can transform completely. Take this fairytale: "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,"
the Prince called, "let down your hair." Rapunzel unbraided her hair 
and slung it out the window. The prince climbed her tresses 
into the tower. Rapunzel is typically told like this, 
with the narrator outside the story. This point of view is called third person. But Rapunzel can also be told 
by a character in the story— a first person narrator. The tail end of Rapunzel’s locks 
plopped down at my feet. I grabbed on and began to climb… ugh! I couldn’t untangle myself. Strands came off all over me, 
sticking to my sweat. In a first person narrative, the story 
can change dramatically depending on which character
is the narrator. Say Rapunzel was narrating 
instead of the prince: I hope he appreciates how long it takes 
to unbraid 25 feet of hair, I thought. OUCH! I'll be honest; I thought my scalp
would stretch off of my skull. "Can you climb any faster?" I yelled. In second person, the narrator addresses 
the story to the reader: He calls your name. He wants you 
to let your hair down. You just finished braiding it, but hey–
you don't get a lot of visitors. Third person, first person, 
and second person perspectives each have unique possibilities
and constraints. So how do you choose a point 
of view for your story? Constraints aren’t necessarily 
a bad thing— they can help focus a story 
or highlight certain elements. For example, a third person narrator is necessarily
a bit removed from the characters. But that can be good for stories 
where a feeling of distance is important. A third person narrator 
can be either limited, meaning they stick close to one 
character’s thoughts and feelings, or they can be omniscient, 
able to flit between characters’ minds and give the reader more information. A first person story creates closeness 
between the reader and the narrator. It’s also restricted 
by the narrator’s knowledge. This can create suspense as the reader finds out information
along with the character. A first person narrator 
doesn’t necessarily have to represent the character’s 
experience faithfully— they can be delusional or dishonest. In Kazuo Ishiguro’s novel 
"The Remains of the Day," Stevens, an aging British butler in 1956, 
recounts his many years of service, but fails to acknowledge the flaws 
of the man he serves. The cracks in his narrative eventually 
draw the reader’s attention to the under-acknowledged failings 
of the culture and class system he inhabits. Justin Torres’s novel, "We the Animals," begins with a plural 
first person narrator: “We were six snatching hands, 
six stomping feet; we were brothers, boys, three little kings
locked in a feud for more.” Partway through the story, 
the point of view shifts to first person singular,
from we to I, as the boys come of age and one brother feels alienated
from the others. Second person is a less common choice. It requires the writer to make the reader
suspend disbelief to become another “you.” Placing the reader 
in a character’s perspective can build urgency and suspense. Sometimes, though, second person is intended to distance 
the narrator from their own story, rather than bring the reader closer 
to the story. In these cases, second person narrators refer 
to themselves as “you” rather than “I.” Writers are constantly experimenting 
with fresh variations on point of view. New virtual and augmented 
reality technologies may expand the possibilities
for this experimentation. By placing people at a particular 
vantage point in virtual space, how might we change the way 
we tell and experience stories?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which of these passages is told in third person point of view?
Options: A. Your mother tells you to go visit your sick grandmother. You’re annoyed because you had plans to go to the mall this afternoon, and you’ll probably be late now. Even though you’re supposed to stay on the path, you take the shortcut through the woods., B. The girl knocks on her grandmother’s door and, when no one answers, she enters. Her sick grandmother lies in the bed. “My,” the girl thinks, “everything about Grandma’s face looks...so big.”, C. My mother told me not to leave the path and cut through the woods, but whatever. I was the one making this walk twice a week, not Mom! Plus, the flowers in the woods were pretty, and I thought Grandma would like them. So that’s why I did it., D. You sneak into the house before the girl arrives and, in one gulp, you eat the grandmother. Then you put on one of her bonnets and look in the mirror. You look nothing like the grandmother. Your eyes, nose, mouth--everything is much bigger. Still, you think, maybe the girl won’t notice right away.

he reached up to give Granpa a big hug good-bye. In the sky behind Granpa appeared a big fine
moon. "Look, Granpa, the moon!" "That ol' moon will always shine for you...
on and on!" Granpa and Max gazed quietly at the big moon
together as it embraced them in soft yellow light. -----
Max smiled at the moon and Granpa, then climbed into the car. "Bye-bye, Granpa! Bye-bye, moon!" As the car pulled away, Max kept his eyes
on Granpa until he disappeared from sight, and all he saw was the moon. Max kept his eyes on that moon, waiting for
it to disappear, too. The long ride hoe was swervy-curvy. This way and that, all the way. And the moon seemed to tag along. Max giggled as he watched the beautiful bright
orb flicker through the passing trees, trailing behind the car as it traveled home, this way
and that, playing peekaboo. Up a hill, down a hill, the moon was ever
there. Over a bridge, around a curve, the moon bounced
along! Around a tree, past a field of sleeping cows,
the moon stayed quietly with Max. Through a small town with roundabout streets,
Max gazed as the moon kept up. At the mouth of a tunnel and out the other
end, Max smiled when he saw the moon there, waiting. Dark clouds tumbled across the night sky. The stars and nightingales all faded away. Max searched the darkness and wondered, where
is the moon? Granpa said it would always shine for me. Finally home, Max took one last look up at
the empty night sky. "I guess that ol' moon couldn't shine for
me all the way home." Upstairs in bed, the room was dark. Max felt alone. He missed Granpa. He missed that tag-along moon. Then slowly, very slowly, Max's bedroom began
to fill with a soft yellow glow. The clouds faded away and the moon peeked
through! Max gazed up at that magic ball of light and
thought about what Granpa said. "That ol' moon will always shine for me...
on and on!" Max knew then that whenever he saw the moon,
he would think of Granpa, on and on. And he slept soundly, embraced in soft yellow
light.

**Transcript**:
Two sisters take the same DNA test. The results show that one sister 
is 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set 
of ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French 
than the other? Tests like these rely on our DNA 
to answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually 
can’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great 
at answering some questions, like who your parents are, but 
can provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors 
from a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where
our DNA comes from in the first place. Each person’s DNA consists 
of about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—
46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount 
of information, but 99% of our genome 
is shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything
distinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize 
less than 1% of that 1%. One chromosome in each pair 
comes from each parent. These halves join at conception: 
when a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, 
combine. The story of our ancestry becomes
muddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes 
in a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes 
of every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 
chromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair 
swap some sections. This process is called recombination, 
and it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes 
that are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely 
in each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different
not only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA 
from each parent, but going further back 
things get more complicated. Without recombination, you would get 
1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, 
and so on, but because recombination happens 
every generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed 
an ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented
in your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come 
from each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, 
that number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high—
or it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more 
ancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply
more represented in her DNA. But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA 
of the sisters' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes 
of deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results 
are based on a comparison to the DNA of people 
living in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, 
or combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences 
that appear in specific places. The sister deemed "more French" 
shares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these 
shared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France. It’s important to note that results 
are based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples 
are barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people
not represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove 
race or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, 
your results might change. Looking further back, you may get a result
like 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate 
species from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% 
of our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations 
interbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today 
have Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations 
in 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic 
contribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French 
and 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% 
of DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things. Looking for traces of our ancestry 
in our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA 
and the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things
with 100% certainty.

interbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today 
have Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations 
in 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic 
contribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French 
and 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% 
of DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things. Looking for traces of our ancestry 
in our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA 
and the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things
with 100% certainty.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 19, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Two sisters take the same DNA test. The results show that one sister 
is 10% French, the other 0%. Both sisters share the same two parents, and therefore the same set 
of ancestors. So how can one be 10% more French 
than the other? Tests like these rely on our DNA 
to answer questions about our ancestry, but our DNA actually 
can’t tell us everything about who we are or where we’re from. DNA tests are great 
at answering some questions, like who your parents are, but 
can provide baffling results to others, like whether you have ancestors 
from a particular region. To understand why, it helps to know where
our DNA comes from in the first place. Each person’s DNA consists 
of about 6 billion base pairs stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes—
46 total. That may seem like a dizzying amount 
of information, but 99% of our genome 
is shared among all humans. The remaining 1% contains everything
distinct about an individual’s ancestry. Commercial DNA tests utilize 
less than 1% of that 1%. One chromosome in each pair 
comes from each parent. These halves join at conception: 
when a sperm and egg, each with only 23 chromosomes, 
combine. The story of our ancestry becomes
muddled before conception. That’s because the 23 chromosomes 
in a sperm or egg aren’t identical to the chromosomes 
of every other cell in the body. As they go from a cell with 46 
chromosomes to a sex cell with only 23, the chromosomes within each pair 
swap some sections. This process is called recombination, 
and it means that every sperm or egg contains single chromosomes 
that are a unique mash up of each pair. Recombination occurs uniquely 
in each sex cell— making two sisters’ chromosomes different
not only from their parents’, but from each other’s. Recombination happens before conception, so you get exactly half of your DNA 
from each parent, but going further back 
things get more complicated. Without recombination, you would get 
1/4 from each grandparent, 1/8 from each great-grandparent, 
and so on, but because recombination happens 
every generation, those numbers vary. The more generations removed 
an ancestor is, the more likely they won’t be represented
in your DNA at all. For example, without recombination, just 1/64 of your DNA would come 
from each ancestor six generations back. Because of recombination, 
that number can be higher, though we don’t know for sure how high—
or it can as low as 0. So one sister isn’t more French in the sense of having more 
ancestors from France. Instead, the French ancestors are simply
more represented in her DNA. But the story doesn’t end there. Tests don’t trace the DNA 
of the sisters' actual French ancestors— we don’t have access to the genomes 
of deceased individuals from previous generations. Instead, these results 
are based on a comparison to the DNA of people 
living in France today. The tests look for genetic markers, 
or combinations of genetic markers. These markers are short sequences 
that appear in specific places. The sister deemed "more French" 
shares genetic markers with people currently living in France. The assumption is that these 
shared markers indicate ancestors from the same place: France. It’s important to note that results 
are based on people who’ve had their genomes sequenced— 80-90% of which are of European descent. Many indigenous peoples 
are barely represented, if at all. The test won’t reveal heritage from people
not represented in the database, and shouldn’t be used to prove 
race or ethnicity. And as more people get sequenced, 
your results might change. Looking further back, you may get a result
like 2% Neanderthal. Though Neanderthals were a separate 
species from humans, that 2% doesn’t come out of the 99% 
of our genome shared among all humans, but the 1% that varies. That’s because about 40,000 years ago, certain human populations 
interbred with Neanderthals, meaning some people alive today 
have Neanderthal ancestors. Many Neanderthal ancestors, in fact: there are so many generations 
in 40,000 years that a single Neanderthal’s genetic 
contribution would be untraceable. You can be both 100% French 
and 2% Neanderthal— though both come from the 1% 
of DNA that makes us different, they’re accounting for different things. Looking for traces of our ancestry 
in our DNA gets complicated very quickly. Both the way we inherit DNA 
and the information available for testing makes it difficult to say certain things
with 100% certainty.

**Transcript**:
Consider this unfortunately 
familiar scenario. Several months ago a highly infectious,
sometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time. It then proliferated faster 
than public health measures could contain it. Now the World Health Organization (WHO)
has declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide. The death toll is starting to rise 
and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare 
the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop 
significantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends on
what global governments choose to do next. They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, 
or Coordinate and Crush. One is widely considered best, 
and it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and communities 
do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed 
as quickly as possible. Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about 
how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity 
almost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions 
to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus 
or the collapse of health care systems. Soon the majority of people 
have been infected and either perished or survived
by building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer
find new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out 
a short time after it began. But there’s another way to create 
herd immunity without such a high cost of life. Let’s reset the clock to the moment 
the WHO declared the pandemic. This time, governments and communities
around the world slow the spread of the virus 
to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tactics
that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected 
and people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place, 
the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands 
of deaths. Some cities get the outbreak under control
and go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing 
when a new case passes through. Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become 
widely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population 
has received it— the precise amount varying 
based on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, 
and the pandemic fizzles out. Let’s rewind the clock one more time, 
to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starve
the virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, 
social distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor 
is to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, 
when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding 
to what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world 
as the giant interconnected system it is. If coordinated properly, this could end 
a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life. But unless the virus is completely 
eradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will be risks of it escalating 
to pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals carrying 
and transmitting the virus might undermine 
our best efforts altogether. So which strategy is best for this deadly,
infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, 
but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all 
if people can be reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination 
alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true 
and nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why vaccination, assisted by 
as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, 
and proven option in the race. Even if the pandemic officially ends 
before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so 
vaccines will continue to protect people. And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives 
won’t necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment 
and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme 
containment measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting,
but not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, 
and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration 
from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential 
pandemic so contained that our children’s children 
won’t even know its name.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider this unfortunately 
familiar scenario. Several months ago a highly infectious,
sometimes deadly respiratory virus infected humans for the first time. It then proliferated faster 
than public health measures could contain it. Now the World Health Organization (WHO)
has declared a pandemic, meaning that it’s spreading worldwide. The death toll is starting to rise 
and everyone is asking the same question: when will the pandemic end? The WHO will likely declare 
the pandemic over once the infection is mostly contained and rates of transmission drop 
significantly throughout the world. But exactly when that happens depends on
what global governments choose to do next. They have three main options: Race through it, Delay and Vaccinate, 
or Coordinate and Crush. One is widely considered best, 
and it may not be the one you think. In the first, governments and communities 
do nothing to halt the spread and instead allow people to be exposed 
as quickly as possible. Without time to study the virus, doctors know little about 
how to save their patients, and hospitals reach peak capacity 
almost immediately. Somewhere in the range of millions 
to hundreds of millions of people die, either from the virus 
or the collapse of health care systems. Soon the majority of people 
have been infected and either perished or survived
by building up their immune responses. Around this point herd immunity kicks in, where the virus can no longer
find new hosts. So the pandemic fizzles out 
a short time after it began. But there’s another way to create 
herd immunity without such a high cost of life. Let’s reset the clock to the moment 
the WHO declared the pandemic. This time, governments and communities
around the world slow the spread of the virus 
to give research facilities time to produce a vaccine. They buy this crucial time through tactics
that may include widespread testing to identify carriers, quarantining the infected 
and people they’ve interacted with, and physical distancing. Even with these measures in place, 
the virus slowly spreads, causing up to hundreds of thousands 
of deaths. Some cities get the outbreak under control
and go back to business as usual, only to have a resurgence and return to physical distancing 
when a new case passes through. Within the next several years, one or possibly several vaccines become 
widely, and hopefully freely, available thanks to a worldwide effort. Once 40-90% of the population 
has received it— the precise amount varying 
based on the virus— herd immunity kicks in, 
and the pandemic fizzles out. Let’s rewind the clock one more time, 
to consider the final strategy: Coordinate and Crush. The idea here is to simultaneously starve
the virus, everywhere, through a combination of quarantine, 
social distancing, and restricting travel. The critical factor 
is to synchronize responses. In a typical pandemic, 
when one country is peaking, another may be getting its first cases. Instead of every leader responding 
to what’s happening in their jurisdiction, here everyone must treat the world 
as the giant interconnected system it is. If coordinated properly, this could end 
a pandemic in just a few months, with low loss of life. But unless the virus is completely 
eradicated— which is highly unlikely— there will be risks of it escalating 
to pandemic levels once again. And factors like animals carrying 
and transmitting the virus might undermine 
our best efforts altogether. So which strategy is best for this deadly,
infectious respiratory virus? Racing through it is a quick fix, 
but would be a global catastrophe, and may not work at all 
if people can be reinfected. Crushing the virus through Coordination 
alone is also enticing for its speed, but only reliable with true 
and nearly impossible global cooperation. That’s why vaccination, assisted by 
as much global coordination as possible, is generally considered to be the winner; it’s the slow, steady, 
and proven option in the race. Even if the pandemic officially ends 
before a vaccine is ready, the virus may reappear seasonally, so 
vaccines will continue to protect people. And although it may take years to create, disruptions to most people’s lives 
won’t necessarily last the full duration. Breakthroughs in treatment 
and prevention of symptoms can make viruses much less dangerous, and therefore require less extreme 
containment measures. Take heart: the pandemic will end. Its legacy will be long-lasting,
but not all bad; the breakthroughs, social services, 
and systems we develop can be used to the betterment of everyone. And if we take inspiration 
from the successes and lessons from the failures, we can keep the next potential 
pandemic so contained that our children’s children 
won’t even know its name.
