**Transcript**:
Long ago, La’amaomao, 
the Hawaiian wind goddess, wielded a gourd that housed
the winds of the Islands. It came to hold her bones, 
along with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed
to her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped 
around his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir 
the skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant
to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status
also made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators
were especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills
and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,
but they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors
and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped
of his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who
plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, 
where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
imagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,
the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised 
to avenge his father and restore his rightful place 
beside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed
their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been
deceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants
divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct
canoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not
return so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication
had to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived 
in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using 
for canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had 
his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, 
the king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit 
misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, 
Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,
but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed 
the young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, 
Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter
on Molokaʻi. For four months, 
Kuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,
he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a
agreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously
discredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge
and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
except the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, 
eventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, 
he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island 
instead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted
not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home 
and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish
against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed 
by the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him
ahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,
the fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a
wager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly
in their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled 
himself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen 
were to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a 
to have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a
to reveal his identity and have the King prove 
his commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths
and asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position
would be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a 
were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names
of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them 
never undermined or forgotten.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the Hawaiʻi Island King who the narrative is about. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 mentions the king and the islands, but it is not about the king's name.

However, since Paka'a was the attendant to the king, and Question 2 mentions "the position of attendant to the king" and Question 4 mentions the king and the island, but they don't ask for the king's name.

But among the provided options, I'd say Question 4 is the closest in terms of context.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 4.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 2: What was passed to Paka'a from his grandmother, La'amaomao?

This question is related to the wind gourd, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, the options in Question 2 do not directly match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 2 is the most similar, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: Why did the two navigators turn the king against Paka'a?**
Options: A. Because Paka'a was not doing his job properly, B. Because they were envious of Paka'a's position and skills, C. Because Paka'a was plotting against the king, D. Because the king asked them to

Although the question is not an exact match, it is related to the roles of Pākaʻa's two enemies, which are revealed to be navigators in the transcript. The correct option (B) also matches the reason why the navigators turned against Paka'a, which is due to their envy of his position and skills.

However, since the question is not an exact match, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

A closer match is not found in the remaining generated MCQs. However, I can suggest a modification to Question 3 to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ:

**Modified Question 3: What were the roles of the two men who turned the king against Paka'a?**
Options: A. Farmers, B. Fishermen, C. Navigators, D. None of the above

This modified question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, since this is not one of the original generated MCQs, I will not consider it as the most similar generated MCQ.

In conclusion, the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 3**, although it is not an exact match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **3**

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Long ago, La’amaomao, 
the Hawaiian wind goddess, wielded a gourd that housed
the winds of the Islands. It came to hold her bones, 
along with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed
to her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped 
around his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir 
the skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant
to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status
also made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators
were especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills
and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,
but they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors
and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped
of his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who
plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, 
where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
imagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,
the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised 
to avenge his father and restore his rightful place 
beside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed
their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been
deceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants
divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct
canoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not
return so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication
had to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived 
in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using 
for canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had 
his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, 
the king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit 
misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, 
Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,
but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed 
the young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, 
Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter
on Molokaʻi. For four months, 
Kuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,
he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a
agreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously
discredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge
and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
except the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, 
eventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, 
he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island 
instead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted
not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home 
and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish
against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed 
by the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him
ahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,
the fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a
wager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly
in their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled 
himself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen 
were to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a 
to have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a
to reveal his identity and have the King prove 
his commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths
and asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position
would be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a 
were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names
of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them 
never undermined or forgotten.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Pākaʻa's ancestral spirits revealing his location to the King in a dream, and the correct option is that they came in the form of two birds. 

Generated MCQ 6 is somewhat related, as it asks about Paka'a's ancestral spirits rotting the trees the king was using for canoe-building, and the correct option is to test the king's loyalty and dedication. However, this is not a direct match.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
except the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, 
eventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, 
he brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island 
instead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted
not finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home 
and forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish
against that of eight fishermen who had been appointed 
by the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him
ahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,
the fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a
wager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly
in their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled 
himself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen 
were to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a 
to have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a
to reveal his identity and have the King prove 
his commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths
and asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position
would be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a 
were back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names
of the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them 
never undermined or forgotten.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Long ago, La’amaomao, 
the Hawaiian wind goddess, wielded a gourd that housed
the winds of the Islands. It came to hold her bones, 
along with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed
to her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped 
around his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir 
the skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant
to King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status
also made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators
were especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills
and responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,
but they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors
and eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped
of his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who
plotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, 
where he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped
imagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,
the way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised 
to avenge his father and restore his rightful place 
beside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed
their selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been
deceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants
divined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct
canoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not
return so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication
had to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived 
in the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using 
for canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had 
his best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, 
the king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit 
misled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, 
Paka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,
but kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed 
the young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, 
Kuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter
on Molokaʻi. For four months, 
Kuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,
he earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a
agreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously
discredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge
and called the winds. As waves crashed, 
Kuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—
