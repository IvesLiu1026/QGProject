**Transcript**:
Arcane books of forbidden lore, disturbing secrets in 
the family bloodline, and terrors so unspeakable the very 
thought of them might drive you mad. By now, these have become standard 
elements in many modern horror stories. But they were largely popularized 
by a single author– one whose name has become an adjective for the particular type of 
terror he inspired. Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers. But by the time he began writing in 1917, World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts. People had seen real horrors, and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore. Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror, one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era. His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility. In "The Colour out of Space," a strange meteorite falls near 
a farmhouse, mutating the farm into a 
nightmarish hellscape. Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form. "At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition that unearths things better 
left undiscovered. In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror, as impossible geometric configurations wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them. Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays, the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction 
were powerful, yet often invisible and indescribable. Rather than recognizable monsters,
graphic violence, or startling shocks, the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed– but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination. Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems often take place in the same 
fictional continuity, with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies. At first glance, they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s 
contemporary New England. But beneath the surface of this seemingly 
similar reality lie dark masters, for whom Earth’s inhabitants 
are mere playthings. More like primordial forces 
than mere deities, Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at 
the corners of our reality. Beings such as Yog-Sothoth, “who froths as primal slime 
in nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts 
of space and time.” Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth, whose destructive impulses are 
stalled only by the “maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine 
of accursed flutes.” These beings exist beyond our 
conceptions of reality, their true forms as inscrutable 
as their motives. Lovecraft’s protagonists– often researchers, anthropologists, 
or antiquarians– stumble onto hints of their existence. But even these indirect glimpses are 
enough to drive them insane. And if they survive, the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference– the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks at the mercy of unfathomable forces. But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries. During his lifetime, Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers, encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own. References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals, such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos, named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus. Unfortunately, Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression in his personal views. The author held strong racist views, and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs. But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices. And after Lovecraft’s death, the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors, often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives that transcend the author’s prejudices. Despite his literary legacy, Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success. He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46– a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference. But his work has inspired numerous 
short stories, novels, tabletop games, and cultural icons. And as long as humans feel a sense of 
dread about our unknown future, Lovecraftian horror will have a place in 
the darkest corners of our imagination.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Lovecraft's incorporation of scientific elements into his stories. While there isn't a direct match, Question 3 mentions a specific story ("The Colour out of Space") that incorporates scientific elements (a meteorite mutating a farm). However, this question focuses on the story's plot rather than the broader theme of Lovecraft's use of scientific elements.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest in intent and theme, I would suggest Question 3, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on specific details from the transcript rather than broader themes or concepts, which makes it challenging to find an exact match for the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the concept of "cosmic indifference" in Lovecraft's stories, which refers to the feeling that humans are insignificant specks in the universe.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is about the occupation of Lovecraft's protagonists, which includes "researchers, anthropologists, or antiquarians." While this question does not directly relate to the concept of cosmic indifference, it touches on the idea that Lovecraft's protagonists often discover the insignificance of humanity through their research and explorations.

However, a closer match can be found in the content of the transcript, which discusses the concept of cosmic indifference in the context of Lovecraft's stories. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this concept.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6, but with a note that it is not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (with a note that it is not a direct match)

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the concept of cosmic indifference in Lovecraft's stories, rather than relying on the existing generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Arcane books of forbidden lore, disturbing secrets in 
the family bloodline, and terrors so unspeakable the very 
thought of them might drive you mad. By now, these have become standard 
elements in many modern horror stories. But they were largely popularized 
by a single author– one whose name has become an adjective for the particular type of 
terror he inspired. Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers. But by the time he began writing in 1917, World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts. People had seen real horrors, and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore. Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror, one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era. His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility. In "The Colour out of Space," a strange meteorite falls near 
a farmhouse, mutating the farm into a 
nightmarish hellscape. Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form. "At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition that unearths things better 
left undiscovered. In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror, as impossible geometric configurations wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them. Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays, the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction 
were powerful, yet often invisible and indescribable. Rather than recognizable monsters,
graphic violence, or startling shocks, the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed– but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination. Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems often take place in the same 
fictional continuity, with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies. At first glance, they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s 
contemporary New England. But beneath the surface of this seemingly 
similar reality lie dark masters, for whom Earth’s inhabitants 
are mere playthings. More like primordial forces 
than mere deities, Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at 
the corners of our reality. Beings such as Yog-Sothoth, “who froths as primal slime 
in nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts 
of space and time.” Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth, whose destructive impulses are 
stalled only by the “maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine 
of accursed flutes.” These beings exist beyond our 
conceptions of reality, their true forms as inscrutable 
as their motives. Lovecraft’s protagonists– often researchers, anthropologists, 
or antiquarians– stumble onto hints of their existence. But even these indirect glimpses are 
enough to drive them insane. And if they survive, the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference– the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks at the mercy of unfathomable forces. But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries. During his lifetime, Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers, encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own. References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals, such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos, named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus. Unfortunately, Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression in his personal views. The author held strong racist views, and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs. But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices. And after Lovecraft’s death, the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors, often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives that transcend the author’s prejudices. Despite his literary legacy, Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success. He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46– a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference. But his work has inspired numerous 
short stories, novels, tabletop games, and cultural icons. And as long as humans feel a sense of 
dread about our unknown future, Lovecraftian horror will have a place in 
the darkest corners of our imagination.

**Transcript**:
In 2012, a team of Japanese and Danish researchers
set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data— that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video— over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second. This wasn’t just any cable. It was a souped-up version 
of fiber optics— the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible. For decades, long-distance communications 
between cities and countries were carried by electrical signals, in wires made of copper. This was slow and inefficient, with metal wires limiting data rates 
and power lost as wasted heat. But in the late 20th century, engineers mastered a far superior method
of transmission. Instead of metal, glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands, hundreds of kilometers long 
and no thicker than human hair. And instead of electricity, these strands carry pulses of light, 
representing digital data. But how does light travel within glass, 
rather than just pass through it? The trick lies in a phenomenon known 
as total internal reflection. Since Isaac Newton’s time, lensmakers and scientists have 
known that light bends when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass. When a ray of light inside glass hits its 
surface at a steep angle, it refracts, or bends 
as it exits into air. But if the ray travels at a shallow angle, it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped, bouncing along inside the glass. Under the right condition, something normally transparent to light
can instead hide it from the world. Compared to electricity or radio, fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances— a little power does scatter away, and fibers can’t bend too sharply, otherwise the light leaks out. Today, a single optical fiber carries many
wavelengths of light, each a different channel of data. And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds 
of these fiber strands. Over a million kilometers of cable 
crisscross our ocean floors to link the continents— that’s enough to wind around the 
Equator nearly thirty times. With fiber optics, distance hardly limits data, which has allowed the internet to evolve
into a planetary computer. Increasingly, our mobile work and play rely on legions 
of overworked computer servers, warehoused in gigantic data centers 
flung across the world. This is called cloud computing, and it leads to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand. The vast majority of internet traffic 
shuttles around inside data centers, where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables. Half of their running power 
is wasted as heat. Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand 
steadily marches on, and the gigahertz signals used in our 
mobile devices are reaching their data delivery limits. It seems fiber optics has been too good
for its own good, fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile
computing expectations. But a related technology, integrated 
photonics, has come to the rescue. Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Silicon wires don’t guide light
as well as fiber. But they do enable engineers to shrink all the devices in a hundred kilometer 
fiber optic network down to tiny photonic chips that plug
into servers and convert their electrical signals 
to optical and back. These electricity-to-light chips allow for
wasteful electrical cables in data centers to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber. Photonic chips can help break open 
wireless bandwidth limitations, too. Researchers are working to replace mobile
gigahertz signals with terahertz frequencies, to carry data thousands of times faster. But these are short-range signals: they get absorbed by moisture in the air, or blocked by tall buildings. With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic 
transmitter chips distributed throughout cities, terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances. They can do so via a stable middleman, optical fiber, and make hyperfast 
wireless connectivity a reality. For all of human history, light has gifted us with sight and heat, serving as a steady companion while we
explored and settled the physical world. Now, we’ve saddled light with information
and redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway— with many different integrated 
photonic exits— to build an even more expansive, 
virtual world.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the comparison of copper metal wires and fiber optics.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: "Compared to electricity or radio, what is a characteristic of fiber optic signals?"

Although this question does not directly address the influence of copper metal wires on the transmission of information as electrical signals, it does compare fiber optic signals to electricity, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to fully match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2012, a team of Japanese and Danish researchers
set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data— that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video— over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second. This wasn’t just any cable. It was a souped-up version 
of fiber optics— the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible. For decades, long-distance communications 
between cities and countries were carried by electrical signals, in wires made of copper. This was slow and inefficient, with metal wires limiting data rates 
and power lost as wasted heat. But in the late 20th century, engineers mastered a far superior method
of transmission. Instead of metal, glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands, hundreds of kilometers long 
and no thicker than human hair. And instead of electricity, these strands carry pulses of light, 
representing digital data. But how does light travel within glass, 
rather than just pass through it? The trick lies in a phenomenon known 
as total internal reflection. Since Isaac Newton’s time, lensmakers and scientists have 
known that light bends when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass. When a ray of light inside glass hits its 
surface at a steep angle, it refracts, or bends 
as it exits into air. But if the ray travels at a shallow angle, it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped, bouncing along inside the glass. Under the right condition, something normally transparent to light
can instead hide it from the world. Compared to electricity or radio, fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances— a little power does scatter away, and fibers can’t bend too sharply, otherwise the light leaks out. Today, a single optical fiber carries many
wavelengths of light, each a different channel of data. And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds 
of these fiber strands. Over a million kilometers of cable 
crisscross our ocean floors to link the continents— that’s enough to wind around the 
Equator nearly thirty times. With fiber optics, distance hardly limits data, which has allowed the internet to evolve
into a planetary computer. Increasingly, our mobile work and play rely on legions 
of overworked computer servers, warehoused in gigantic data centers 
flung across the world. This is called cloud computing, and it leads to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand. The vast majority of internet traffic 
shuttles around inside data centers, where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables. Half of their running power 
is wasted as heat. Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand 
steadily marches on, and the gigahertz signals used in our 
mobile devices are reaching their data delivery limits. It seems fiber optics has been too good
for its own good, fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile
computing expectations. But a related technology, integrated 
photonics, has come to the rescue. Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Silicon wires don’t guide light
as well as fiber. But they do enable engineers to shrink all the devices in a hundred kilometer 
fiber optic network down to tiny photonic chips that plug
into servers and convert their electrical signals 
to optical and back. These electricity-to-light chips allow for
wasteful electrical cables in data centers to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber. Photonic chips can help break open 
wireless bandwidth limitations, too. Researchers are working to replace mobile
gigahertz signals with terahertz frequencies, to carry data thousands of times faster. But these are short-range signals: they get absorbed by moisture in the air, or blocked by tall buildings. With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic 
transmitter chips distributed throughout cities, terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances. They can do so via a stable middleman, optical fiber, and make hyperfast 
wireless connectivity a reality. For all of human history, light has gifted us with sight and heat, serving as a steady companion while we
explored and settled the physical world. Now, we’ve saddled light with information
and redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway— with many different integrated 
photonic exits— to build an even more expansive, 
virtual world.

**Transcript**:
Arcane books of forbidden lore, disturbing secrets in 
the family bloodline, and terrors so unspeakable the very 
thought of them might drive you mad. By now, these have become standard 
elements in many modern horror stories. But they were largely popularized 
by a single author– one whose name has become an adjective for the particular type of 
terror he inspired. Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers. But by the time he began writing in 1917, World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts. People had seen real horrors, and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore. Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror, one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era. His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility. In "The Colour out of Space," a strange meteorite falls near 
a farmhouse, mutating the farm into a 
nightmarish hellscape. Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form. "At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition that unearths things better 
left undiscovered. In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror, as impossible geometric configurations wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them. Like then-recent discoveries of 
subatomic particles or X-rays, the forces in Lovecraft’s fiction 
were powerful, yet often invisible and indescribable. Rather than recognizable monsters,
graphic violence, or startling shocks, the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed– but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination. Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems often take place in the same 
fictional continuity, with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies. At first glance, they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s 
contemporary New England. But beneath the surface of this seemingly 
similar reality lie dark masters, for whom Earth’s inhabitants 
are mere playthings. More like primordial forces 
than mere deities, Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at 
the corners of our reality. Beings such as Yog-Sothoth, “who froths as primal slime 
in nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts 
of space and time.” Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth, whose destructive impulses are 
stalled only by the “maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine 
of accursed flutes.” These beings exist beyond our 
conceptions of reality, their true forms as inscrutable 
as their motives. Lovecraft’s protagonists– often researchers, anthropologists, 
or antiquarians– stumble onto hints of their existence. But even these indirect glimpses are 
enough to drive them insane. And if they survive, the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference– the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks at the mercy of unfathomable forces. But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries. During his lifetime, Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers, encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own. References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals, such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos, named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus. Unfortunately, Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression in his personal views. The author held strong racist views, and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs. But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices. And after Lovecraft’s death, the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors, often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives that transcend the author’s prejudices. Despite his literary legacy, Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success. He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46– a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference. But his work has inspired numerous 
short stories, novels, tabletop games, and cultural icons. And as long as humans feel a sense of 
dread about our unknown future, Lovecraftian horror will have a place in 
the darkest corners of our imagination.

graphic violence, or startling shocks, the terror of “Lovecraftian” horror lies 
in what’s not directly portrayed– but left instead to the dark depths 
of our imagination. Lovecraft’s dozens of short stories, 
novellas, and poems often take place in the same 
fictional continuity, with recurring characters, locations, 
and mythologies. At first glance, they appear to be set within Lovecraft’s 
contemporary New England. But beneath the surface of this seemingly 
similar reality lie dark masters, for whom Earth’s inhabitants 
are mere playthings. More like primordial forces 
than mere deities, Lovecraft’s Great Old Ones lurk at 
the corners of our reality. Beings such as Yog-Sothoth, “who froths as primal slime 
in nuclear chaos beyond the nethermost outposts 
of space and time.” Or the blind, idiot god Azathoth, whose destructive impulses are 
stalled only by the “maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine 
of accursed flutes.” These beings exist beyond our 
conceptions of reality, their true forms as inscrutable 
as their motives. Lovecraft’s protagonists– often researchers, anthropologists, 
or antiquarians– stumble onto hints of their existence. But even these indirect glimpses are 
enough to drive them insane. And if they survive, the reader is left with no feeling of 
triumph, only cosmic indifference– the terrible sense that we are 
but insignificant specks at the mercy of unfathomable forces. But perhaps the greatest power 
these creatures had was their appeal to Lovecraft’s 
contemporaries. During his lifetime, Lovecraft corresponded 
with other writers, encouraging them to employ elements and 
characters from his stories in their own. References to Lovecraftian gods 
or arcane tomes can be found in many stories 
by his pen pals, such as Robert E. Howard and Robert Bloch. Today, this shared universe is called 
the Cthulhu Mythos, named after Lovecraft’s infamous blend 
of dragon and octopus. Unfortunately, Lovecraft’s fear of the unknown found 
a less savory expression in his personal views. The author held strong racist views, and some of his works include 
crude stereotypes and slurs. But the rich world he created would 
outlive his personal prejudices. And after Lovecraft’s death, the Cthulhu Mythos was adopted 
by a wide variety of authors, often reimagining them from 
diverse perspectives that transcend the author’s prejudices. Despite his literary legacy, Lovecraft was never able to 
find financial success. He died unknown and penniless 
at the age of 46– a victim of the universe’s cosmic 
indifference. But his work has inspired numerous

**Transcript**:
Arcane books of forbidden lore, disturbing secrets in 
the family bloodline, and terrors so unspeakable the very 
thought of them might drive you mad. By now, these have become standard 
elements in many modern horror stories. But they were largely popularized 
by a single author– one whose name has become an adjective for the particular type of 
terror he inspired. Born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, Howard Phillips Lovecraft grew up 
admiring the Gothic horror stories written by Edgar Allan Poe 
and Robert Chambers. But by the time he began writing in 1917, World War I had cast a long 
shadow over the arts. People had seen real horrors, and were no longer frightened 
of fantastical folklore. Lovecraft sought to invent a 
new kind of terror, one that responded to the rapid 
scientific progress of his era. His stories often used scientific elements
to lend eerie plausibility. In "The Colour out of Space," a strange meteorite falls near 
a farmhouse, mutating the farm into a 
nightmarish hellscape. Others incorporated scientific 
methodology into their form. "At the Mountains of Madness" is written 
as a report of an Antarctic expedition that unearths things better 
left undiscovered. In others, mathematics themselves 
become a source of horror, as impossible geometric configurations wreak havoc on the minds of 
any who behold them. Like then-recent discoveries of

**Transcript**:
In 2012, a team of Japanese and Danish researchers
set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data— that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video— over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second. This wasn’t just any cable. It was a souped-up version 
of fiber optics— the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible. For decades, long-distance communications 
between cities and countries were carried by electrical signals, in wires made of copper. This was slow and inefficient, with metal wires limiting data rates 
and power lost as wasted heat. But in the late 20th century, engineers mastered a far superior method
of transmission. Instead of metal, glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands, hundreds of kilometers long 
and no thicker than human hair. And instead of electricity, these strands carry pulses of light, 
representing digital data. But how does light travel within glass, 
rather than just pass through it? The trick lies in a phenomenon known 
as total internal reflection. Since Isaac Newton’s time, lensmakers and scientists have 
known that light bends when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass. When a ray of light inside glass hits its 
surface at a steep angle, it refracts, or bends 
as it exits into air. But if the ray travels at a shallow angle, it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped, bouncing along inside the glass. Under the right condition, something normally transparent to light
can instead hide it from the world. Compared to electricity or radio, fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances— a little power does scatter away, and fibers can’t bend too sharply, otherwise the light leaks out. Today, a single optical fiber carries many
wavelengths of light, each a different channel of data. And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds 
of these fiber strands. Over a million kilometers of cable 
crisscross our ocean floors to link the continents— that’s enough to wind around the 
Equator nearly thirty times. With fiber optics, distance hardly limits data, which has allowed the internet to evolve
into a planetary computer. Increasingly, our mobile work and play rely on legions 
of overworked computer servers, warehoused in gigantic data centers 
flung across the world. This is called cloud computing, and it leads to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand. The vast majority of internet traffic 
shuttles around inside data centers, where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables. Half of their running power 
is wasted as heat. Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand 
steadily marches on, and the gigahertz signals used in our 
mobile devices are reaching their data delivery limits. It seems fiber optics has been too good
for its own good, fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile
computing expectations. But a related technology, integrated 
photonics, has come to the rescue. Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Silicon wires don’t guide light
as well as fiber. But they do enable engineers to shrink all the devices in a hundred kilometer 
fiber optic network down to tiny photonic chips that plug
into servers and convert their electrical signals 
to optical and back. These electricity-to-light chips allow for
wasteful electrical cables in data centers to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber. Photonic chips can help break open 
wireless bandwidth limitations, too. Researchers are working to replace mobile
gigahertz signals with terahertz frequencies, to carry data thousands of times faster. But these are short-range signals: they get absorbed by moisture in the air, or blocked by tall buildings. With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic 
transmitter chips distributed throughout cities, terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances. They can do so via a stable middleman, optical fiber, and make hyperfast 
wireless connectivity a reality. For all of human history, light has gifted us with sight and heat, serving as a steady companion while we
explored and settled the physical world. Now, we’ve saddled light with information
and redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway— with many different integrated 
photonic exits— to build an even more expansive, 
virtual world.

photonics, has come to the rescue. Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Silicon wires don’t guide light
as well as fiber. But they do enable engineers to shrink all the devices in a hundred kilometer 
fiber optic network down to tiny photonic chips that plug
into servers and convert their electrical signals 
to optical and back. These electricity-to-light chips allow for
wasteful electrical cables in data centers to be swapped out for 
power-efficient fiber. Photonic chips can help break open 
wireless bandwidth limitations, too. Researchers are working to replace mobile
gigahertz signals with terahertz frequencies, to carry data thousands of times faster. But these are short-range signals: they get absorbed by moisture in the air, or blocked by tall buildings. With tiny wireless-to-fiber photonic 
transmitter chips distributed throughout cities, terahertz signals can be relayed over 
long-range distances. They can do so via a stable middleman, optical fiber, and make hyperfast 
wireless connectivity a reality. For all of human history, light has gifted us with sight and heat, serving as a steady companion while we
explored and settled the physical world. Now, we’ve saddled light with information
and redirected it to run along a fiber optic superhighway— with many different integrated 
photonic exits— to build an even more expansive, 
virtual world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2012, a team of Japanese and Danish researchers
set a world record, transmitting 1 petabit of data— that’s 10,000 hours of high-def video— over a fifty-kilometer cable, in a second. This wasn’t just any cable. It was a souped-up version 
of fiber optics— the hidden network that links our planet and makes the internet possible. For decades, long-distance communications 
between cities and countries were carried by electrical signals, in wires made of copper. This was slow and inefficient, with metal wires limiting data rates 
and power lost as wasted heat. But in the late 20th century, engineers mastered a far superior method
of transmission. Instead of metal, glass can be carefully melted and 
drawn into flexible fiber strands, hundreds of kilometers long 
and no thicker than human hair. And instead of electricity, these strands carry pulses of light, 
representing digital data. But how does light travel within glass, 
rather than just pass through it? The trick lies in a phenomenon known 
as total internal reflection. Since Isaac Newton’s time, lensmakers and scientists have 
known that light bends when it passes between air and 
materials like water or glass. When a ray of light inside glass hits its 
surface at a steep angle, it refracts, or bends 
as it exits into air. But if the ray travels at a shallow angle, it’ll bend so far that it stays trapped, bouncing along inside the glass. Under the right condition, something normally transparent to light
can instead hide it from the world. Compared to electricity or radio, fiber optic signals barely degrade 
over great distances— a little power does scatter away, and fibers can’t bend too sharply, otherwise the light leaks out. Today, a single optical fiber carries many
wavelengths of light, each a different channel of data. And a fiber optic cable contains hundreds 
of these fiber strands. Over a million kilometers of cable 
crisscross our ocean floors to link the continents— that’s enough to wind around the 
Equator nearly thirty times. With fiber optics, distance hardly limits data, which has allowed the internet to evolve
into a planetary computer. Increasingly, our mobile work and play rely on legions 
of overworked computer servers, warehoused in gigantic data centers 
flung across the world. This is called cloud computing, and it leads to two big problems: heat waste and bandwidth demand. The vast majority of internet traffic 
shuttles around inside data centers, where thousands of servers are connected 
by traditional electrical cables. Half of their running power 
is wasted as heat. Meanwhile, wireless bandwidth demand 
steadily marches on, and the gigahertz signals used in our 
mobile devices are reaching their data delivery limits. It seems fiber optics has been too good
for its own good, fueling overly-ambitious cloud and mobile
computing expectations. But a related technology, integrated 
photonics, has come to the rescue. Light can be guided not 
only in optical fibers, but also in ultrathin silicon wires. Silicon wires don’t guide light
