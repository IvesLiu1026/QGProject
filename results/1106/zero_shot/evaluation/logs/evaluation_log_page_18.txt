**Transcript**:
For millennia, the people of Britain had been using 
bronze to make tools and jewelry, and as a currency for trade. But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing 
social upheaval and an economic crisis— what we would call a recession today. What causes recessions? This question has long been the subject 
of heated debate among economists, and for good reason. A recession can be a mild decline in 
economic activity in a single country that lasts months, a long-lasting downturn with global 
ramifications that last years, or anything in between. Complicating matters further, there are countless variables that 
contribute to an economy’s health, making it difficult to pinpoint 
specific causes. So it helps to start with the big picture: recessions occur when there is a negative 
disruption to the balance between supply and demand. There’s a mismatch between how many 
goods people want to buy, how many products and services producers 
can offer, and the price of the goods and services 
sold, which prompts an economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply 
and demand is reflected in its inflation rates 
and interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services 
get more expensive. Put another way, the value 
of money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought 
to encourage economic activity. But high inflation that isn’t accompanied 
with high demand can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for 
individuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage
of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors 
until the loan is repaid. Low interest rates mean that companies 
can afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest 
in more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase 
costs for producers and consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest 
rates can give us insight into the health 
of the economy, but what causes these fluctuations 
in the first place? The most obvious causes are shocks 
like natural disaster, war, and geopolitical factors. An earthquake, for example, can destroy the infrastructure needed to 
produce important commodities such as oil. That forces the supply side of the economy
to charge more for products that use oil, discouraging demand and potentially 
prompting a recession. But some recessions occur in times of 
economic prosperity— possibly even because 
of economic prosperity. Some economists believe that business 
activity from a market’s expansion can occasionally reach 
an unsustainable level. For example, corporations and consumers 
may borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth 
will help them handle the added burden. But if the economy doesn’t grow as 
quickly as expected, they may end up with more debt 
than they can manage. To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect 
funds from other activities, reducing business activity. Psychology can also contribute 
to a recession. Fear of a recession can become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people to pull back investing
and spending. In response, producers might 
cut operating costs to help weather the expected 
decline in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost 
cuts eventually lower wages, leading to even lower demand. Even policy designed to help prevent 
recessions can contribute. When times are tough, governments and 
central banks may print money, increase spending, and lower central bank
interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their 
interest rates, effectively making debt “cheaper” 
to boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable 
and eventually need to be reversed to prevent excessive inflation. That can cause a recession if people have 
become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually
ended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming 
and food production. Modern markets are more complex, making today’s recessions far 
more difficult to navigate. But each recession provides new data to 
help anticipate and respond to future recessions more effectively.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 5: What can cause fluctuations in inflation and interest rates? Options: A. Changes in government policies, B. Shocks like natural disasters, war, and geopolitical factors, C. Changes in consumer behavior, D. All of the above.

However, this question does not directly address the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that discusses the direct causes of a recession. Among the generated MCQs, Question 6: How can excessive borrowing by corporations and consumers contribute to a recession? Options: A. By increasing demand for products, B. By reducing business activity to pay off debt, C. By lowering interest rates, D. By increasing inflation rates is the most relevant.

But it still does not match the ground truth MCQ. Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most relevant to the topic of causes of recession.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be: Question 2: What is the general cause of recessions according to the transcript? Options: A. High inflation rates, B. Low interest rates, C. A negative disruption to the balance between supply and demand, D. Excessive government spending.

However, the correct option for this question does not match the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

Considering all these factors, I would choose Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ because it is the only one that mentions government actions (policies) as a potential cause of recession, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question is about the effect of interest rates on companies, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ. The correct option for Question 4 is not explicitly stated, but based on the transcript, we know that low interest rates make it more likely for companies to borrow money and invest in projects. If we invert this, we can infer that high interest rates would make companies less likely to borrow and invest, which aligns with the correct option of the ground truth MCQ (A. spend less). 

While the options are not identical, the intent and content of Question 4 are the most similar to the ground truth MCQ among the provided generated MCQs.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the factor that would not be impacted (directly) by a recession, and the options include inflation rate, interest rates, unemployment, and "all stated factors are affected".

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most related, as it asks about the causes of fluctuations in inflation and interest rates. However, it does not directly address the question of which factor is not impacted by a recession.

Since none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ. Instead, I suggest that a new generated MCQ should be created to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 5, but with the understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 5, with the caveat mentioned above)

sold, which prompts an economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply 
and demand is reflected in its inflation rates 
and interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services 
get more expensive. Put another way, the value 
of money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought 
to encourage economic activity. But high inflation that isn’t accompanied 
with high demand can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for 
individuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage
of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors 
until the loan is repaid. Low interest rates mean that companies 
can afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest 
in more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase 
costs for producers and consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest 
rates can give us insight into the health 
of the economy, but what causes these fluctuations 
in the first place? The most obvious causes are shocks 
like natural disaster, war, and geopolitical factors. An earthquake, for example, can destroy the infrastructure needed to 
produce important commodities such as oil. That forces the supply side of the economy
to charge more for products that use oil, discouraging demand and potentially 
prompting a recession. But some recessions occur in times of 
economic prosperity— possibly even because 
of economic prosperity. Some economists believe that business 
activity from a market’s expansion can occasionally reach 
an unsustainable level. For example, corporations and consumers 
may borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth 
will help them handle the added burden. But if the economy doesn’t grow as 
quickly as expected, they may end up with more debt 
than they can manage. To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect 
funds from other activities, reducing business activity. Psychology can also contribute 
to a recession. Fear of a recession can become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people to pull back investing
and spending. In response, producers might 
cut operating costs to help weather the expected 
decline in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost 
cuts eventually lower wages, leading to even lower demand. Even policy designed to help prevent 
recessions can contribute. When times are tough, governments and 
central banks may print money, increase spending, and lower central bank
interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their 
interest rates, effectively making debt “cheaper” 
to boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable 
and eventually need to be reversed to prevent excessive inflation. That can cause a recession if people have 
become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually
ended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming 
and food production. Modern markets are more complex, making today’s recessions far 
more difficult to navigate. But each recession provides new data to 
help anticipate and respond to future recessions more effectively.

**Transcript**:
“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here… ” Inscribed above the Gate of Hell, these ominous words warn dark 
tidings for Dante as he begins his descent into inferno. Yet despite the grim tone, this prophecy sets into motion what is 
perhaps the greatest love story ever told; an epic journey that encompasses both 
the human and the divine. But for Dante to reach 
benevolent salvation, he must first find his way through Hell. This landscape of torture is the setting 
for "Inferno," the first in a three-part narrative poem written by Dante Alighieri 
in the 14th century. Casting himself as the protagonist, Dante travels deeper and deeper 
into Hell’s abyss, witnessing obscene punishments distinct 
to each of its nine realms. Beginning in Limbo, he travels through the
circles of Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy, Violence, and Fraud, to the horrific ninth circle of Treachery, where sinners are trapped under the 
watchful eyes of Satan himself. The following two parts, "Purgatorio" and 
"Paradiso," continue Dante’s journey, as he scales the Mount of Purgatory and ascends the nine celestial 
spheres of Heaven. Written together over 10 years, these 
3 sections comprise the "Divine Comedy"– an allegorical imagining of the soul’s 
journey towards God. But Dante’s "Divine Comedy" is more than 
just religious allegory. It’s also a witty, scathing commentary on 
Italian politics. A soldier and statesman from Florence, 
Dante was staunchly faithful to God, but often critical of the 
Roman Catholic Church. He particularly disliked its rampant 
nepotism and practice of simony, the buying and selling of religious 
favours such as pardons from sin. Many groups took advantage of these 
corrupt customs, but few supported them as much as the 
Guelfi Neri, or Black Guelphs. This was a political and religious faction which sought to expand the pope’s 
political influence. Dante was a member of the Guelfi Bianchi, 
or White Guelphs– who believed Florence needed more 
freedom from Roman influence. As a public representative for the 
White Guelphs, Dante frequently spoke out against 
the pope’s power, until the Black Guelphs leveraged their
position to exile him from Florence in 1302. But rather than silencing him, this lifelong exile led to Dante’s 
greatest critique of all. Dishonored and with little hope of return, the author freely aired his grievances 
with the Church and Italian society. Writing the "Divine Comedy" in Italian, rather than the traditional Latin of the 
educated elite, Dante ensured the widest possible audience
for his biting political commentary. In the "Inferno’s" circle of the Wrathful, Dante eagerly witnesses sinners tear Black Guelph Filippo 
Argenti limb from limb. In the circle of Fraud, Dante converses with a mysterious sinner 
burning in the circle’s hottest flames. He learns that this is Pope Nicholas III, who tells Dante that his two successors 
will take his place when they die— all three guilty of simony and corruption. Despite the bleak and sometimes violent 
imagery in "Inferno," the "Divine Comedy" is also a love story. Though Dante had an arranged marriage with the daughter of a powerful 
Florentine family, he had also been unrequitedly in love with
another woman since he was nine years old: Beatrice Portinari. Despite allegedly meeting just twice, 
she became Dante’s lifelong muse, serving as the inspiration and subject for
many of his works. In fact, it’s Beatrice who launches his 
intrepid journey into the pits of Hell and up the terraces of Mount Purgatory. Portrayed as a powerful, heavenly figure, she leads Dante through "Paradiso’s"
concentric spheres of Heaven until he is finally face-to-face with God. In the centuries since its publication, the "Divine Comedy’s" themes of love, 
sin, and redemption have been embraced by numerous artists– from Auguste Rodin and Salvador Dali, 
to Ezra Pound and Neil Gaiman. And the poet himself received his own 
belated, earthly redemption in 2008, when the city of Florence finally revoked 
Dante’s antiquated exile.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the nine circles of Hell, and the correct answer is "Sloth" because it is not one of the nine circles mentioned in the transcript. 

A generated MCQ that is somewhat related to this topic is Question 3, which asks about the names of the three sections of Dante's "Divine Comedy". Although this question does not directly ask about the nine circles of Hell, it does relate to the overall structure of Dante's work, which includes the nine circles of Hell.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the nine circles of Hell. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the given options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 3 is the most similar, although it's a very weak similarity.

will take his place when they die— all three guilty of simony and corruption. Despite the bleak and sometimes violent 
imagery in "Inferno," the "Divine Comedy" is also a love story. Though Dante had an arranged marriage with the daughter of a powerful 
Florentine family, he had also been unrequitedly in love with
another woman since he was nine years old: Beatrice Portinari. Despite allegedly meeting just twice, 
she became Dante’s lifelong muse, serving as the inspiration and subject for
many of his works. In fact, it’s Beatrice who launches his 
intrepid journey into the pits of Hell and up the terraces of Mount Purgatory. Portrayed as a powerful, heavenly figure, she leads Dante through "Paradiso’s"
concentric spheres of Heaven until he is finally face-to-face with God. In the centuries since its publication, the "Divine Comedy’s" themes of love, 
sin, and redemption have been embraced by numerous artists– from Auguste Rodin and Salvador Dali, 
to Ezra Pound and Neil Gaiman. And the poet himself received his own 
belated, earthly redemption in 2008, when the city of Florence finally revoked 
Dante’s antiquated exile.

**Transcript**:
“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here… ” Inscribed above the Gate of Hell, these ominous words warn dark 
tidings for Dante as he begins his descent into inferno. Yet despite the grim tone, this prophecy sets into motion what is 
perhaps the greatest love story ever told; an epic journey that encompasses both 
the human and the divine. But for Dante to reach 
benevolent salvation, he must first find his way through Hell. This landscape of torture is the setting 
for "Inferno," the first in a three-part narrative poem written by Dante Alighieri 
in the 14th century. Casting himself as the protagonist, Dante travels deeper and deeper 
into Hell’s abyss, witnessing obscene punishments distinct 
to each of its nine realms. Beginning in Limbo, he travels through the
circles of Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy, Violence, and Fraud, to the horrific ninth circle of Treachery, where sinners are trapped under the 
watchful eyes of Satan himself. The following two parts, "Purgatorio" and 
"Paradiso," continue Dante’s journey, as he scales the Mount of Purgatory and ascends the nine celestial 
spheres of Heaven. Written together over 10 years, these 
3 sections comprise the "Divine Comedy"– an allegorical imagining of the soul’s 
journey towards God. But Dante’s "Divine Comedy" is more than 
just religious allegory. It’s also a witty, scathing commentary on 
Italian politics. A soldier and statesman from Florence, 
Dante was staunchly faithful to God, but often critical of the 
Roman Catholic Church. He particularly disliked its rampant 
nepotism and practice of simony, the buying and selling of religious 
favours such as pardons from sin. Many groups took advantage of these 
corrupt customs, but few supported them as much as the 
Guelfi Neri, or Black Guelphs. This was a political and religious faction which sought to expand the pope’s 
political influence. Dante was a member of the Guelfi Bianchi, 
or White Guelphs– who believed Florence needed more 
freedom from Roman influence. As a public representative for the 
White Guelphs, Dante frequently spoke out against 
the pope’s power, until the Black Guelphs leveraged their
position to exile him from Florence in 1302. But rather than silencing him, this lifelong exile led to Dante’s 
greatest critique of all. Dishonored and with little hope of return, the author freely aired his grievances 
with the Church and Italian society. Writing the "Divine Comedy" in Italian, rather than the traditional Latin of the 
educated elite, Dante ensured the widest possible audience
for his biting political commentary. In the "Inferno’s" circle of the Wrathful, Dante eagerly witnesses sinners tear Black Guelph Filippo 
Argenti limb from limb. In the circle of Fraud, Dante converses with a mysterious sinner 
burning in the circle’s hottest flames. He learns that this is Pope Nicholas III, who tells Dante that his two successors 
will take his place when they die— all three guilty of simony and corruption. Despite the bleak and sometimes violent 
imagery in "Inferno," the "Divine Comedy" is also a love story. Though Dante had an arranged marriage with the daughter of a powerful 
Florentine family, he had also been unrequitedly in love with

**Transcript**:
The royal couple of Haiti rode into their 
coronation to thunderous applause. After receiving his ornate 
crown and scepter, Henry Christophe ascended his throne, 
towering 20 meters in the air. But little did the cheering onlookers 
know that the first king of Haiti would also be its last. Enslaved at birth on the 
island of Grenada, Christophe spent his childhood being 
moved between multiple Caribbean islands. Just 12 years old in 1779, he accompanied his master to aid the 
American revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah. This prolonged siege would be Christophe’s
first encounter with violent revolution. There are few surviving written records about Christophe’s life immediately 
after the war. Over the next decade, we know he worked as a mason 
and a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, 
as Haiti was then known. In 1791, when the colony’s 
slaves rose up in rebellion, Christophe got another opportunity 
to fight for freedom. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebels 
fought against plantation owners, as well as British and Spanish forces 
seeking control of the island. Christophe quickly rose 
through the ranks, proving himself the equal of more 
experienced generals. By 1793, Louverture had successfully liberated 
all of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved people, and by 1801 he’d established the 
island as a semi-autonomous colony. But during this time, Napoleon Bonaparte 
had assumed power in France, and made it his mission to restore 
slavery and French authority throughout the empire. French attempts to reinstate slavery 
met fierce resistance, with General Christophe even 
burning the capital city to prevent military occupation. Finally, the rebellion and an 
outbreak of yellow fever forced French soldiers to withdraw— 
but the fight was not without casualties. Louverture was captured, 
and left to die in a French prison; a fate that Christophe’s nine-year-old son
would share only a few years later. Following the revolution, Christophe and generals Jean-Jacques 
Dessalines and Alexandre Pétion rose to prominent positions 
in the new government. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed 
the emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power 
alienated his supporters. Eventually, Dessalines’ rule incited 
a political conspiracy that ended in his assassination in 1806. The subsequent power struggle led to a 
Civil War, which split the country in two. By 1807, Christophe was governing as 
president of the north in Cap-Haïtien, and Pétion was ruling the south 
from Port-au-Prince. Pétion tried to stay true to the 
revolution’s democratic roots by modeling his republic after 
the United States. He even supported anti-colonial 
revolutionaries in other nations. These policies endeared 
him to his people, but they slowed trade and economic growth. Christophe, conversely, had more 
aggressive plans for an independent Haiti. He redistributed land to the people, while
retaining state control of agriculture. He also established trade with 
many foreign nations, including Great Britain and 
the United States, and pledged non-interference 
with their foreign policies. He even built a massive Citadel in case 
the French tried to invade again. To accomplish all of this, Christophe 
instituted mandatory labor, and to strengthen his authority, 
he crowned himself king in 1811. During his reign, he lived in an 
elegant palace called Sans Souci along with his wife and their 
three remaining children. Christophe’s kingdom oversaw rapid 
development of trade, industry, culture, and education. He imported renowned European 
artists to Haiti’s cultural scene, as well as European teachers, in order 
to establish public education. But while the king was initially 
popular among his subjects, his labor mandates were an 
uncomfortable reminder of the slavery Haitians fought to destroy. Over time, his increasingly authoritarian 
policies lost support, and his opponents to the south 
gained strength. In October 1820, his reign finally 
reached its tragic conclusion. Months after a debilitating stroke 
left him unable to govern, key members of his military 
defected to southern forces. Betrayed and despondent, 
the king committed suicide. Today, the traces of Christophe’s 
complicated history can still be found in the crumbling 
remains of his palaces, and in Haiti’s legacy as the first nation 
to permanently abolish slavery.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the specific revolutionary war Henry Christophe fought in before the one in Haiti, it does mention that at a certain age, he accompanied his master to aid the American revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah, which is related to the American Revolution. This information is also present in the ground truth MCQ, making Question 2 the most similar in terms of content and intent.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more ideal match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the revolutionary war Henry Christophe fought in before the one in Haiti, with options that include the American Revolution.

**Transcript**:
The royal couple of Haiti rode into their 
coronation to thunderous applause. After receiving his ornate 
crown and scepter, Henry Christophe ascended his throne, 
towering 20 meters in the air. But little did the cheering onlookers 
know that the first king of Haiti would also be its last. Enslaved at birth on the 
island of Grenada, Christophe spent his childhood being 
moved between multiple Caribbean islands. Just 12 years old in 1779, he accompanied his master to aid the 
American revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah. This prolonged siege would be Christophe’s
first encounter with violent revolution. There are few surviving written records about Christophe’s life immediately 
after the war. Over the next decade, we know he worked as a mason 
and a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, 
as Haiti was then known. In 1791, when the colony’s 
slaves rose up in rebellion, Christophe got another opportunity 
to fight for freedom. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebels 
fought against plantation owners, as well as British and Spanish forces 
seeking control of the island. Christophe quickly rose 
through the ranks, proving himself the equal of more 
experienced generals. By 1793, Louverture had successfully liberated 
all of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved people, and by 1801 he’d established the 
island as a semi-autonomous colony. But during this time, Napoleon Bonaparte 
had assumed power in France, and made it his mission to restore 
slavery and French authority throughout the empire. French attempts to reinstate slavery 
met fierce resistance, with General Christophe even 
burning the capital city to prevent military occupation. Finally, the rebellion and an 
outbreak of yellow fever forced French soldiers to withdraw— 
but the fight was not without casualties. Louverture was captured, 
and left to die in a French prison; a fate that Christophe’s nine-year-old son
would share only a few years later. Following the revolution, Christophe and generals Jean-Jacques 
Dessalines and Alexandre Pétion rose to prominent positions 
in the new government. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed 
the emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power 
alienated his supporters. Eventually, Dessalines’ rule incited 
a political conspiracy that ended in his assassination in 1806. The subsequent power struggle led to a 
Civil War, which split the country in two. By 1807, Christophe was governing as 
president of the north in Cap-Haïtien, and Pétion was ruling the south 
from Port-au-Prince. Pétion tried to stay true to the 
revolution’s democratic roots by modeling his republic after 
the United States. He even supported anti-colonial 
revolutionaries in other nations. These policies endeared 
him to his people, but they slowed trade and economic growth. Christophe, conversely, had more 
aggressive plans for an independent Haiti. He redistributed land to the people, while
retaining state control of agriculture. He also established trade with 
many foreign nations, including Great Britain and 
the United States, and pledged non-interference 
with their foreign policies. He even built a massive Citadel in case 
the French tried to invade again. To accomplish all of this, Christophe 
instituted mandatory labor, and to strengthen his authority, 
he crowned himself king in 1811. During his reign, he lived in an 
elegant palace called Sans Souci along with his wife and their 
three remaining children. Christophe’s kingdom oversaw rapid 
development of trade, industry, culture, and education. He imported renowned European 
artists to Haiti’s cultural scene, as well as European teachers, in order 
to establish public education. But while the king was initially 
popular among his subjects, his labor mandates were an 
uncomfortable reminder of the slavery Haitians fought to destroy. Over time, his increasingly authoritarian 
policies lost support, and his opponents to the south 
gained strength. In October 1820, his reign finally 
reached its tragic conclusion. Months after a debilitating stroke 
left him unable to govern, key members of his military 
defected to southern forces. Betrayed and despondent, 
the king committed suicide. Today, the traces of Christophe’s 
complicated history can still be found in the crumbling 
remains of his palaces, and in Haiti’s legacy as the first nation 
to permanently abolish slavery.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the question itself does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the options provided include the correct answer (Alexandre Pétion is not among the options, but the other relevant figures are). Question 5 is about who was proclaimed emperor of independent Haiti in 1804, and one of the options is Jean-Jacques Dessalines, who is mentioned in the same context as Alexandre Pétion in the transcript. However, a more suitable generated MCQ would have been one that directly asked about Christophe's rival in the south of Haiti.

A more detailed analysis reveals that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and options provided, I would choose Question 5.

However, since the original prompt asked to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ and there isn't a direct match, I will state that there isn't a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all. If you want to know how to get better quality sleep each night in order to conquer the hurdles of sleep deprivation, we have some tips and research for you over on ASAPThought.

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

**Transcript**:
On their 20th birthday, identical twin 
astronauts volunteer for an experiment. Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella 
will board a spaceship. Stella’s ship will travel at 86.6% the 
speed of light to visit a star that is 10 
light-years away, then return to Earth at the same speed. As they prepare to part ways, the twins wonder what will happen 
when they’re reunited. Since a light year is exactly the distance
light can travel in a year, Stella’s journey should take 23 years. But from having studied 
special relativity, the twins know it’s not that simple. First of all, the faster an object moves 
through space, the slower it moves through time 
compared to an unmoving observer. This relationship can be quantified with 
something called the Lorentz factor, which is defined by this equation. And secondly, the length of a moving 
object as measured by an observer at rest will contract by the same factor. At 86.6% of the speed of light 
the Lorentz factor is 2, meaning time will pass twice as slowly 
aboard the spaceship. Of course, Stella won’t notice 
time slowing down. That’s because all time-based processes 
in the ship will slow down as well– clocks and electrical devices; Stella’s biological activities including 
her rate of aging and her perception of time itself. The only people who could notice time
on the moving spaceship passing slower for Stella would be observers in an inertial, 
or non-accelerating, reference frame– like Terra back on Earth. Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet
back on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of 
looking at things. Because all movement is relative, Stella argues it would be just as valid to
say her spaceship will stand still while the rest of the universe, 
including Terra, moves around her. And in that case, time will pass twice as 
slowly for Terra, making Stella the older twin in the end. They can’t each be older than the other, 
so which one of them is right? This apparent contradiction is known as
the “Twin Paradox.” But it’s not really a paradox– just an example of how special relativity 
can be easily misunderstood. To test their theories in real-time, each of the twins agrees to send 
a burst of light to the other every time a year has passed for them. Unlike other objects, the speed of light 
is always constant regardless of an observer’s 
reference frame. A light burst sent from Earth will be 
measured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its 
outbound or return trip. So when one twin observes 
a burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the 
other twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light 
to travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, 
and the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will 
simply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent 
to a year as she perceives it. Stella’s path will stretch from the same 
origin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero 
distance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from 
Earth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel 
one light-year, its path will be a 45-degree 
diagonal line. And because Stella is 
traveling away from it, by the time the light catches up to her, over 7 total years will have passed for
Terra, and over 4 for Stella. By the time Stella observes 
Terra’s second burst, she will already be on her return journey. But now, since she’s moving towards the 
source of the light, it will take less time to reach her, and she’ll observe the bursts 
more frequently. This means that Stella observes Terra 
aging slowly for the first half of her journey, but aging rapidly during the return half. Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though 
Terra, the destination star, and the whole universe are 
moving around her. And because of length contraction, Stella observes the distance between 
them shrinking by a factor of 2. This means each leg of the trip will only 
take about six years from Stella’s perspective. When she sends the first signal to Earth, 
two years will have passed for Terra. Stella will send four more light bursts 
during her outbound journey, each one from farther away. By the time Terra observes the first pulse
from Stella's inbound journey, over 21 years will have passed for her. For the rest of Stella's return home, Terra receives multiple light 
bursts each year. Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly 
for about 90% of their 23 years apart, and aging rapidly during the last 10%. This asymmetry accounts for why the 
paradox isn’t really a paradox. Although each twin witnesses time both speeding up and slowing 
down for the other, Stella sees an even split, while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for 
most of the time they’re apart. This is consistent with each twin’s 
measurement of the space voyage, which takes 23 Earth years, but only 
11.5 as experienced aboard the ship. When the twins are reunited, Terra will be
43 years old, while Stella will be 31. Where Stella went wrong was her assumption that she and Terra had
equal claim to being inertial observers. To be an inertial observer, one has to 
maintain a constant speed and direction relative to the rest of the universe. Terra was at rest the entire time, 
so her velocity was a constant zero. But when Stella changed her direction 
for the return journey, she entered a different reference frame 
from the one she’d started in. Terra and Stella now both have a better
understanding of how spacetime works. And as twins who are eleven 
years apart in age, they’re a perfect example 
of special relativity.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If Stella measures Terra’s time passing slower than her own, Terra will see Stella’s time passing faster than her own.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Who can notice time passing slower for Stella on the moving spaceship?**

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and intent are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ discusses the relative measurement of time passing between Stella and Terra, while Question 4 addresses who can notice the time passing slower for Stella.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 4**

But I must note that it's not a perfect match.

If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create a new question that combines elements from Questions 4, 8, and the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would choose:

back on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of 
looking at things. Because all movement is relative, Stella argues it would be just as valid to
say her spaceship will stand still while the rest of the universe, 
including Terra, moves around her. And in that case, time will pass twice as 
slowly for Terra, making Stella the older twin in the end. They can’t each be older than the other, 
so which one of them is right? This apparent contradiction is known as
the “Twin Paradox.” But it’s not really a paradox– just an example of how special relativity 
can be easily misunderstood. To test their theories in real-time, each of the twins agrees to send 
a burst of light to the other every time a year has passed for them. Unlike other objects, the speed of light 
is always constant regardless of an observer’s 
reference frame. A light burst sent from Earth will be 
measured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its 
outbound or return trip. So when one twin observes 
a burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the 
other twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light 
to travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, 
and the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will 
simply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent 
to a year as she perceives it. Stella’s path will stretch from the same 
origin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero 
distance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from 
Earth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel 
one light-year, its path will be a 45-degree 
diagonal line. And because Stella is 
traveling away from it, by the time the light catches up to her, over 7 total years will have passed for
Terra, and over 4 for Stella. By the time Stella observes 
Terra’s second burst, she will already be on her return journey. But now, since she’s moving towards the 
source of the light, it will take less time to reach her, and she’ll observe the bursts 
more frequently. This means that Stella observes Terra 
aging slowly for the first half of her journey, but aging rapidly during the return half. Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though 
Terra, the destination star, and the whole universe are 
moving around her. And because of length contraction, Stella observes the distance between 
them shrinking by a factor of 2. This means each leg of the trip will only 
take about six years from Stella’s perspective. When she sends the first signal to Earth, 
two years will have passed for Terra. Stella will send four more light bursts 
during her outbound journey, each one from farther away. By the time Terra observes the first pulse
from Stella's inbound journey, over 21 years will have passed for her. For the rest of Stella's return home, Terra receives multiple light 
bursts each year. Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly 
for about 90% of their 23 years apart, and aging rapidly during the last 10%. This asymmetry accounts for why the 
paradox isn’t really a paradox. Although each twin witnesses time both speeding up and slowing 
down for the other, Stella sees an even split, while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for 
most of the time they’re apart. This is consistent with each twin’s 
measurement of the space voyage, which takes 23 Earth years, but only 
11.5 as experienced aboard the ship. When the twins are reunited, Terra will be
43 years old, while Stella will be 31. Where Stella went wrong was her assumption that she and Terra had
equal claim to being inertial observers. To be an inertial observer, one has to 
maintain a constant speed and direction relative to the rest of the universe. Terra was at rest the entire time, 
so her velocity was a constant zero. But when Stella changed her direction 
for the return journey, she entered a different reference frame 
from the one she’d started in. Terra and Stella now both have a better
understanding of how spacetime works. And as twins who are eleven 
years apart in age, they’re a perfect example 
of special relativity.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2. Although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the concept of time dilation and the Lorentz factor, which is also present in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar.

But, since the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an explanation of how the ground truth MCQ can be matched with a combination of the generated MCQs.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the time dilation effect on Stella's spaceship. The correct answer can be inferred from the Lorentz factor, which is mentioned in Question 2. However, the ground truth MCQ also involves calculating the time passed on Earth, which is not directly addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

To answer the ground truth MCQ, one would need to understand the concept of time dilation, the Lorentz factor, and how to apply it to calculate the time passed on Earth. This requires a combination of knowledge from Question 2 (Lorentz factor and time dilation) and Question 7 (constant speed of light, which is related to the calculation of time passed on Earth).

Therefore, while Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

**Transcript**:
On their 20th birthday, identical twin 
astronauts volunteer for an experiment. Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella 
will board a spaceship. Stella’s ship will travel at 86.6% the 
speed of light to visit a star that is 10 
light-years away, then return to Earth at the same speed. As they prepare to part ways, the twins wonder what will happen 
when they’re reunited. Since a light year is exactly the distance
light can travel in a year, Stella’s journey should take 23 years. But from having studied 
special relativity, the twins know it’s not that simple. First of all, the faster an object moves 
through space, the slower it moves through time 
compared to an unmoving observer. This relationship can be quantified with 
something called the Lorentz factor, which is defined by this equation. And secondly, the length of a moving 
object as measured by an observer at rest will contract by the same factor. At 86.6% of the speed of light 
the Lorentz factor is 2, meaning time will pass twice as slowly 
aboard the spaceship. Of course, Stella won’t notice 
time slowing down. That’s because all time-based processes 
in the ship will slow down as well– clocks and electrical devices; Stella’s biological activities including 
her rate of aging and her perception of time itself. The only people who could notice time
on the moving spaceship passing slower for Stella would be observers in an inertial, 
or non-accelerating, reference frame– like Terra back on Earth. Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet
back on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of

**Transcript**:
“A few dozen hours can affect the 
outcome of whole lifetimes/ And that when they do, 
those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains 
of a burned clock… must be resurrected from the ruins 
and examined.” This is the premise of Arundhati Roy’s 
1997 novel "The God of Small Things." Set in a town in Kerala, India called 
Ayemenem, the story revolves around fraternal 
twins Rahel and Estha, who are separated for 23 years 
after the fateful few dozen hours in which their cousin drowns, their 
mother’s illicit affair is revealed, and her lover is murdered. While the book is set at the point of 
Rahel and Estha’s reunion, the narrative takes place mostly in
the past, reconstructing the details around the tragic events that 
led to their separation. Roy’s rich language and masterful 
storytelling earned her the prestigious Booker prize 
for "The God of Small Things." In the novel, she interrogates the culture
of her native India, including its social mores 
and colonial history. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary 
social class that is thousands of years old. By the mid-20th century, the original four castes associated 
with specific occupations had been divided into 
some 3000 sub-castes. Though the caste system was 
Constitutionally abolished in 1950, it continued to shape 
social life in India, routinely marginalizing people 
of lower castes. In the novel, Rahel and Estha have a 
close relationship with Velutha, a worker in their family’s pickle factory and member of the so-called 
“untouchable” caste. When Velutha and the twins’ mother, Ammu,
embark on an affair, they violate what Roy describes as the 
“love laws” forbidding intimacy between 
different castes. Roy warns that the tragic consequences 
of their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” 
like “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.” Roy’s writing makes constant use of these 
ordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most 
tragic moments. The book opens at the funeral of the 
twins’ half-British cousin Sophie after her drowning. As the family mourns, lilies curl and 
crisp in the hot church. A baby bat crawls up a funeral sari. Tears drip from a chin like 
raindrops from a roof. The novel forays into the past to explore
the characters’ struggles to operate in a world 
where they don’t quite fit, alongside their nation’s 
political turmoil. Ammu struggles not to lash out at her 
beloved children when she feels particularly trapped in her
parents’ small-town home, where neighbors judge and shun her 
for being divorced. Velutha, meanwhile, balances his affair
with Ammu and friendship with the twins not only with his employment 
to their family, but also with his membership to a 
budding communist countermovement to Indira Ghandi’s “Green Revolution.” In the 1960s, the misleadingly named 
“Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield 
crops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes 
off their land and caused widespread 
environmental damage. When the twins return to Ayemenem 
as adults, the consequences of the Green Revolution 
are all around them. The river that was bursting with life 
in their childhood greets them “with a ghastly skull’s smile,
with holes where teeth had been, and a limp hand raised

experience, she never loses sight of the way her 
characters are shaped by the time and the place where they live. In the world of "The God of Small Things," “Various kinds of despair competed 
for primacy… personal despair could never be 
desperate enough... personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside

**Transcript**:
“A few dozen hours can affect the 
outcome of whole lifetimes/ And that when they do, 
those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains 
of a burned clock… must be resurrected from the ruins 
and examined.” This is the premise of Arundhati Roy’s 
1997 novel "The God of Small Things." Set in a town in Kerala, India called 
Ayemenem, the story revolves around fraternal 
twins Rahel and Estha, who are separated for 23 years 
after the fateful few dozen hours in which their cousin drowns, their 
mother’s illicit affair is revealed, and her lover is murdered. While the book is set at the point of 
Rahel and Estha’s reunion, the narrative takes place mostly in
the past, reconstructing the details around the tragic events that 
led to their separation. Roy’s rich language and masterful 
storytelling earned her the prestigious Booker prize 
for "The God of Small Things." In the novel, she interrogates the culture
of her native India, including its social mores 
and colonial history. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary 
social class that is thousands of years old. By the mid-20th century, the original four castes associated 
with specific occupations had been divided into 
some 3000 sub-castes. Though the caste system was 
Constitutionally abolished in 1950, it continued to shape 
social life in India, routinely marginalizing people 
of lower castes. In the novel, Rahel and Estha have a 
close relationship with Velutha, a worker in their family’s pickle factory and member of the so-called 
“untouchable” caste. When Velutha and the twins’ mother, Ammu,
embark on an affair, they violate what Roy describes as the 
“love laws” forbidding intimacy between 
different castes. Roy warns that the tragic consequences 
of their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” 
like “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.” Roy’s writing makes constant use of these 
ordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most 
tragic moments. The book opens at the funeral of the 
twins’ half-British cousin Sophie after her drowning. As the family mourns, lilies curl and 
crisp in the hot church. A baby bat crawls up a funeral sari. Tears drip from a chin like 
raindrops from a roof. The novel forays into the past to explore
the characters’ struggles to operate in a world 
where they don’t quite fit, alongside their nation’s 
political turmoil. Ammu struggles not to lash out at her 
beloved children when she feels particularly trapped in her
parents’ small-town home, where neighbors judge and shun her 
for being divorced. Velutha, meanwhile, balances his affair
with Ammu and friendship with the twins not only with his employment 
to their family, but also with his membership to a 
budding communist countermovement to Indira Ghandi’s “Green Revolution.” In the 1960s, the misleadingly named 
“Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield 
crops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the religion of Rahel and Estha's family, while the generated MCQs cover various other topics related to the novel.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of the caste system and social context, I would choose Question 6: "What is the term used to describe the rules forbidding intimacy between different castes in the novel?" This question is related to the social context of the novel and the caste system, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent or options.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 6 as the most similar.

None of the generated MCQs address this event or have similar options.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of the novel and the characters involved, I would say that Question 5 is the closest.

“Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield 
crops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes 
off their land and caused widespread 
environmental damage. When the twins return to Ayemenem 
as adults, the consequences of the Green Revolution 
are all around them. The river that was bursting with life 
in their childhood greets them “with a ghastly skull’s smile,
with holes where teeth had been, and a limp hand raised 
from a hospital bed.” As Roy probes the depths of human 
experience, she never loses sight of the way her 
characters are shaped by the time and the place where they live. In the world of "The God of Small Things," “Various kinds of despair competed 
for primacy… personal despair could never be 
desperate enough... personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside
shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible 
public turmoil of a nation.”

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 7: What is the name of the twins' half-British cousin who drowns in the novel? Options: A. Sophie, B. Rahel, C. Estha, D. Ammu

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks for the name of the cousin who drowns, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks how Sophie Mol dies. 

A more similar question would be one that asks about the cause of Sophie Mol's death. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

But if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say Question 3 is the closest, as it mentions the drowning of the cousin as part of the event that leads to the separation of the twins.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3

**Transcript**:
After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being 
battered by waves, Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and 
sage as old as the world itself— washed up on the shores 
of distant Pohjola. Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was 
a dark and frozen land, ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth 
hag of the North." The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen 
back to health but demanded a reward for 
returning him home. Not content with mere gold or silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— 
the Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of white-swan
feathers," “the milk of greatest virtue," “a single grain of barley," and 
“the finest wool of lambskins," this artifact was said to be 
an endless font of wealth. But Väinämöinen knew that 
only Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged 
the sky-dome itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him 
home and fetch the smith. Though the journey was far from easy, 
the bard finally made it back to Kalevala. But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy 
North— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen 
into climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm 
to carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with 
extravagant hospitality and promised him the hand 
of her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When she finally asked if Ilmarinen 
was capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith declared he could 
indeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend 
the forge to his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but 
ill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that 
thirsted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated
fields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds 
themselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he 
pulled the Sampo, with its lid of many colors from 
the forge’s flames. On its sides the smith carefully crafted 
a grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill. Louhi was so delighted with the object’s 
limitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure 
inside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to 
claim his prize, the promised maiden refused to marry him,
and the smith had to return home alone. Years passed, and while 
Pohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without 
wives or great wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard 
proposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and the two sailed north with the 
help of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history 
of starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half 
the Sampo’s profits as compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi summoned 
her forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, 
the bard played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending 
Pohjola into a deep slumber. Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo 
and quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was ecstatic 
at their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing 
of their triumph. The bard refused, knowing the dangers 
of celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling, 
Lemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful singing voice woke 
a nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused 
the Pohjolan horde. The army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen 
raised a rock to breach their hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed 
into a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as they 
attacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo 
in her claw, but just as quickly, it dropped into 
the sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’s reach. Buried on the ocean floor, the remnants of this powerful device 
remain in the realm of Ahti, god of water— where they grind salt for the seas 
to this very day.

North— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen 
into climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm 
to carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with 
extravagant hospitality and promised him the hand 
of her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When she finally asked if Ilmarinen 
was capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith declared he could 
indeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend 
the forge to his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but 
ill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that 
thirsted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated
fields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds 
themselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he 
pulled the Sampo, with its lid of many colors from 
the forge’s flames. On its sides the smith carefully crafted 
a grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill. Louhi was so delighted with the object’s 
limitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure 
inside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to 
claim his prize, the promised maiden refused to marry him,
and the smith had to return home alone. Years passed, and while 
Pohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without 
wives or great wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard 
proposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and the two sailed north with the 
help of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history 
of starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half 
the Sampo’s profits as compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi summoned 
her forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, 
the bard played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending 
Pohjola into a deep slumber. Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo 
and quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was ecstatic 
at their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing 
of their triumph. The bard refused, knowing the dangers 
of celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling, 
Lemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful singing voice woke 
a nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused 
the Pohjolan horde. The army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen 
raised a rock to breach their hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed 
into a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as they 
attacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo 
in her claw, but just as quickly, it dropped into 
the sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’s reach. Buried on the ocean floor, the remnants of this powerful device 
remain in the realm of Ahti, god of water— where they grind salt for the seas 
to this very day.

**Transcript**:
After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being 
battered by waves, Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and 
sage as old as the world itself— washed up on the shores 
of distant Pohjola. Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was 
a dark and frozen land, ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth 
hag of the North." The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen 
back to health but demanded a reward for 
returning him home. Not content with mere gold or silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— 
the Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of white-swan
feathers," “the milk of greatest virtue," “a single grain of barley," and 
“the finest wool of lambskins," this artifact was said to be 
an endless font of wealth. But Väinämöinen knew that 
only Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged 
the sky-dome itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him 
home and fetch the smith. Though the journey was far from easy, 
the bard finally made it back to Kalevala. But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy 
North— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen 
into climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the closest match would be a question that involves Louhi's actions during the heroes' quest to retrieve the Sampo.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, which mentions the heroes' quest to retrieve the Sampo and the consequences of Lemminkäinen's actions. However, it does not specifically mention Louhi's transformation.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about Louhi's transformation during the heroes' quest to retrieve the Sampo. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose from the available options, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
When the Hoover Dam was 
completed in 1936, it created a huge source of 
hydroelectric power and zapped a sleepy desert town to life: 
Las Vegas, Nevada. With the power supply from the dam, Las Vegas soon exploded 
with vibrant displays. The source of these dazzling lights was 
electrified neon gas. There are two tricky obstacles 
to making lighted signs out of this naturally clear, 
odorless gas: capturing it and making it glow. French inventor Georges Claude came up 
with techniques to do both. In 1902, he developed a way of liquefying and 
separating specific gases from the air, producing neon on an industrial 
scale for the first time. By 1910, he had come up with a way 
to trap the gas in a glass tube with a special electrode at either end, 
and neon lighting was born. In workshops like Claude's, artisans known as tube-benders 
made neon signs by hand. The tube-benders heated small sections 
of a long, hollow glass tube and quickly bent them into shape. After the glass cooled, they attached 
electrodes to each end and removed the air with a vacuum pump. Then, they passed a high voltage 
current through the tube to remove any impurities on the 
inside of the glass. Finally, they pumped the neon gas in 
and sealed off the electrodes. When a neon sign is turned on, the electric current causes some of 
the neon atoms' electrons to accelerate and break free of their orbits, leaving 
behind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from 
one electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms, 
causing them to ionize as well. When these excited electrons fall back 
to their normal energy levels, their excess energy is carried away 
by photons, or particles of light. All this happens in an instant, and the glow from the photons is what 
we see when we switch on a neon sign. Though it's common to call any 
gas-filled sign a "neon" sign, there are actually 5 different 
gases used in production. Each gas emits photons of a different 
wavelength when electrified, which correspond to different 
colors of light. Neon gives off an orange-red glow, argon 
glows a pale lavender, helium a dusty pink, krypton a silver-
white, and xenon a light purple. These 5 gases can be combined 
with color-coated tubing to create an electrified rainbow of 
text and images. Business owners soon realized how 
effective these colorful beacons were for attracting customers. And unlike a light bulb, a neon sign has 
no incandescent filaments to burn out, and can shine continuously for 40 years 
before the gas depletes. By the 1930s, neon signs were lighting 
up storefronts all over the world. Because of the glass tubes' 
fragile nature, it usually wasn't feasible to ship 
them over long distances. Instead, most neon signs were created by 
local neon shops and then installed nearby. Signs with humor, personality, and 
intricate designs proliferated, no two exactly alike. But by the end of World War II, plastics had become widely 
available and inexpensive, and plastic signs supplanted neon 
as messengers of modernity. Many towns removed neon signs they 
viewed as old-fashioned. Today, neon sign production is only 
a fraction of what it was at its peak, but the craft of tube bending lives 
on relatively unchanged. New creations hand-crafted 
by local artisans join survivors from the heyday of neon, hiding in plain sight in city streets 
around the world.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the country where neon lighting was first commercially produced, it does ask about the person who developed techniques for liquefying and separating neon gas from the air, making it possible to produce neon on an industrial scale. According to the transcript, this person is Georges Claude, who is French. Therefore, the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ can be inferred from the answer to Question 2.

behind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from 
one electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms, 
causing them to ionize as well. When these excited electrons fall back 
to their normal energy levels, their excess energy is carried away 
by photons, or particles of light. All this happens in an instant, and the glow from the photons is what 
we see when we switch on a neon sign. Though it's common to call any 
gas-filled sign a "neon" sign, there are actually 5 different 
gases used in production. Each gas emits photons of a different 
wavelength when electrified, which correspond to different 
colors of light. Neon gives off an orange-red glow, argon 
glows a pale lavender, helium a dusty pink, krypton a silver-
white, and xenon a light purple. These 5 gases can be combined 
with color-coated tubing to create an electrified rainbow of 
text and images. Business owners soon realized how 
effective these colorful beacons were for attracting customers. And unlike a light bulb, a neon sign has 
no incandescent filaments to burn out, and can shine continuously for 40 years 
before the gas depletes. By the 1930s, neon signs were lighting 
up storefronts all over the world. Because of the glass tubes' 
fragile nature, it usually wasn't feasible to ship 
them over long distances. Instead, most neon signs were created by 
local neon shops and then installed nearby. Signs with humor, personality, and 
intricate designs proliferated, no two exactly alike. But by the end of World War II, plastics had become widely 
available and inexpensive, and plastic signs supplanted neon 
as messengers of modernity. Many towns removed neon signs they 
viewed as old-fashioned. Today, neon sign production is only 
a fraction of what it was at its peak, but the craft of tube bending lives 
on relatively unchanged. New creations hand-crafted 
by local artisans join survivors from the heyday of neon, hiding in plain sight in city streets 
around the world.

**Transcript**:
When the Hoover Dam was 
completed in 1936, it created a huge source of 
hydroelectric power and zapped a sleepy desert town to life: 
Las Vegas, Nevada. With the power supply from the dam, Las Vegas soon exploded 
with vibrant displays. The source of these dazzling lights was 
electrified neon gas. There are two tricky obstacles 
to making lighted signs out of this naturally clear, 
odorless gas: capturing it and making it glow. French inventor Georges Claude came up 
with techniques to do both. In 1902, he developed a way of liquefying and 
separating specific gases from the air, producing neon on an industrial 
scale for the first time. By 1910, he had come up with a way 
to trap the gas in a glass tube with a special electrode at either end, 
and neon lighting was born. In workshops like Claude's, artisans known as tube-benders 
made neon signs by hand. The tube-benders heated small sections 
of a long, hollow glass tube and quickly bent them into shape. After the glass cooled, they attached 
electrodes to each end and removed the air with a vacuum pump. Then, they passed a high voltage 
current through the tube to remove any impurities on the 
inside of the glass. Finally, they pumped the neon gas in 
and sealed off the electrodes. When a neon sign is turned on, the electric current causes some of 
the neon atoms' electrons to accelerate and break free of their orbits, leaving 
behind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from 
one electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms,

**Transcript**:
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe. Little do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation. As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception. You’ve tracked the captors to where 
they’re holding the chef prisoner. From your hiding spot, you can see him 
on the other side of the glass, while in front of you an interrogator 
wearing headphones speaks into a microphone. “We already know the recipe is on the 
13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe deposit box numbered between 
13 and 1300. Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?” You can’t hear the chef’s answer, 
but you can see that he’s lying. The interrogator, however, falls for it. He follows up by asking, 
“Is it a perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer 
but can tell the chef is lying, while the interrogator takes 
him at his word. He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully. The interrogator thinks 
for a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me whether 
or not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.” But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, 
blocking your view. Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the answer and 
is sending agents to retrieve the recipe. You know that the Burger Bazaar people 
have the wrong box number. But can you figure out the right one 
and retrieve the recipe yourself? Pause the video to figure it 
out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The key here is to work backwards. We don’t know what the chef answers 
to the final question or whether he answers truthfully. But we do know that by the time 
the interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options 
down to two numbers– one where the second digit is 1, 
and one where it isn’t. Our goal, then, is to find answers to the 
previous questions that lead to just two possibilities. Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our options the most 
is if the number is a perfect cube. That leaves us with only eight answers 
between 13 and 1300. So let’s assume the answer to the 
third question was a truthful YES. Now, let’s look at the second question. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options
to just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are 
both a square and a cube. But neither of these has a 1 
as the second digit. So the given answer to the second question
must’ve been NO. And that also means we can eliminate these
two squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers. Now for the first question, 
which allows us to divide this list. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being less than 500, we’d have four options, which is too many. But a NO leaves us with two numbers 
greater than 500, one of which does have 
a 1 as its second digit. We don’t know which of these numbers 
the interrogator thinks is correct. But that doesn’t matter– remember, his conclusion 
was based on lies. You, on the other hand, are now in a 
position to reconstruct the truth. First, the chef said the number was 
greater than 500 but lied, meaning it’s actually less than 500. Second, the chef said it wasn’t a 
perfect square but lied again, meaning the number is indeed a square. And finally, he truthfully confirmed 
that it was also a cube. And as we’ve already seen, the only number under 500 that’s 
both a square and a cube is 64. You find the secret recipe and are gone 
before anyone’s the wiser. Corporate espionage is not an easy game— but sometimes, that’s just 
how the sausage is made.

**Transcript**:
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe. Little do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation. As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception. You’ve tracked the captors to where 
they’re holding the chef prisoner. From your hiding spot, you can see him 
on the other side of the glass, while in front of you an interrogator 
wearing headphones speaks into a microphone. “We already know the recipe is on the 
13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe deposit box numbered between 
13 and 1300. Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?” You can’t hear the chef’s answer, 
but you can see that he’s lying. The interrogator, however, falls for it. He follows up by asking, 
“Is it a perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer 
but can tell the chef is lying, while the interrogator takes 
him at his word. He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully. The interrogator thinks 
for a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me whether 
or not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.” But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, 
blocking your view. Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the answer and 
is sending agents to retrieve the recipe. You know that the Burger Bazaar people 
have the wrong box number. But can you figure out the right one 
and retrieve the recipe yourself? Pause the video to figure it 
out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The key here is to work backwards. We don’t know what the chef answers 
to the final question or whether he answers truthfully. But we do know that by the time 
the interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options 
down to two numbers– one where the second digit is 1, 
and one where it isn’t. Our goal, then, is to find answers to the 
previous questions that lead to just two possibilities. Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our options the most 
is if the number is a perfect cube. That leaves us with only eight answers 
between 13 and 1300. So let’s assume the answer to the 
third question was a truthful YES. Now, let’s look at the second question. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options
to just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are 
both a square and a cube. But neither of these has a 1 
as the second digit. So the given answer to the second question
must’ve been NO. And that also means we can eliminate these
two squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers. Now for the first question, 
which allows us to divide this list. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being less than 500, we’d have four options, which is too many. But a NO leaves us with two numbers 
greater than 500, one of which does have 
a 1 as its second digit. We don’t know which of these numbers 
the interrogator thinks is correct. But that doesn’t matter– remember, his conclusion 
was based on lies. You, on the other hand, are now in a 
position to reconstruct the truth. First, the chef said the number was 
greater than 500 but lied, meaning it’s actually less than 500. Second, the chef said it wasn’t a 
perfect square but lied again, meaning the number is indeed a square. And finally, he truthfully confirmed 
that it was also a cube. And as we’ve already seen, the only number under 500 that’s 
both a square and a cube is 64. You find the secret recipe and are gone 
before anyone’s the wiser. Corporate espionage is not an easy game— but sometimes, that’s just 
how the sausage is made.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks which of the following is NOT a perfect cube, and the options are A. 216, B. 625, and C. 343.

A generated MCQ that is somewhat related to this question is:

Question 4: How many numbers between 13 and 1300 are perfect cubes? Options: A. 2, B. 4, C. 6, D. 8

However, this question does not ask which number is NOT a perfect cube, but rather how many numbers are perfect cubes.

Another generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 3: What is the constraint provided by the third question asked by the interrogator? Options: A. The number is a perfect square, B. The number is a perfect cube, C. The number is less than 500, D. The number's second digit is a one

However, this question does not ask which number is NOT a perfect cube, but rather what is the constraint provided by the third question.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number box the interrogator thinks the recipe is in. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 10 asks about the secret recipe's safe deposit box number, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's essential to note that Question 10 does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, as it asks about the actual box number, not what the interrogator thinks the box number is. Additionally, the options provided in Question 10 do not include "We don't know," which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 10, but with the understanding that it does not accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

"It gets easier, right?" These are the words
I often hear from young parents who are new to the game
of worrying about their children. I tell them that it doesn't. It gets different, but there's always something
to worry about as parents. I remember how I would lie
half-awake at night listening to my son breathe when he was young and had asthma, and then, when he was a teen, until I heard the front door chime open, and I knew that he was home safe. Worrying about our kids
comes with the territory. Now, many of these worries
are about basic issues, like what they eat,
where they are, who they're with. But we also need to keep an eye on
new behaviors and fads. The latest craze is something
that may not yet be on everyone's radar as a serious health concern, and that is the newfound
popularity of vaping, or inhaling sweet aerosols produced by vaporizing
e-liquids in e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, or "vapes,"
as they are commonly called, are flying off the shelves like candy. This year, the e-cigarette
market is expected to drive 26 billion dollars in sales worldwide. Over the next six years, that volume is expected to double. We have a lot of serious concerns
about the health impact of vaping, and unfortunately,
not nearly enough answers. This becomes even more concerning
when you think of who uses e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use, at least in the US, has grown rapidly among youth
and young adults -- our kids, our most vulnerable population. There was a 900 percent growth
in the use of e-cigarettes by youth between 2012 and 2015. The most recent estimates suggest that approximately 3.6 million
high school and middle school students have used e-cigarettes in the US. Now, e-cigarettes were originally created to offer smokers a cleaner
form of nicotine to help with their cigarette addiction. In the US, these devices
come under the FDA's jurisdiction as a tobacco product. But the science on these devices
has not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth, so regulations on the components
of these devices and e-liquids are lagging. Current regulations do restrict
sales of these devices to anyone under the age of 18, but these do not seem
to have had much of an impact on the explosion in the use
of these devices by teens. You know, the first time
I heard of and saw an e-cigarette, I knew right away
that teens would love it. These devices are technology on a stick, a perfect fit for
the smartphone generation -- small, rechargeable, easy to use,
easy to modify, nice smelling -- some even sync with your smartphone
to let you know how much you have vaped. Even I was very drawn
to these very clever devices. And since I had spent a long time
researching teen and adult addictions, I immediately realized that these devices
fit perfectly into the teen psyche. Teens are impulsive,
and they love to try new things. They're also craving independence,
and they love to make things their own. E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly by allowing them the chance
to both innovate and personalize their vape experience. They can choose from over 15,000
different e-liquid flavors and multiple nicotine concentrations. They can even create their own
nicotine flavor combination. They can change how much vapor
is produced from these devices by modifying the puff volume
and the constituents and the power and temperature
of the devices. They can even use these devices
for "cloud chasing." Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks or smoke tricks, involves producing large vape clouds
with quirky shapes and names, like rings, dragons, ghosts ... Cloud chasers can even participate
in cloud competitions and win prizes for creating
the most innovative shaped clouds. Teens can also change the strength
and throat hit from the vapor by either vaporizing the e-liquid
at higher temperatures or dripping the e-liquid
directly onto a heated coil. They can even use these devices
for marijuana vaping. And since the devices
use lower temperatures and do not combust or burn the marijuana, they can do this very discreetly, without the distinctive smell
of burnt marijuana. So they can really make these vape
experiences their own, which may explain the astounding rise
in the use of these devices by youth. E-cigarettes are technically
a very simple device. There is a receptacle for the e-liquid
which can be a tank, a pod or a plug. There is a battery that charges the coil,
which then vaporizes the e-liquid. And then there is a mouthpiece, where the user can actually draw
from the e-cigarette. In 2017, there were 466 e-cigarette
devices in the marketplace. These range from cigarette-like devices
which are also called "cigalikes" to tank systems,
which are also called "pens." And then there are modified devices,
which are also called "mods." Mods look nothing like a cigarette, and they come in various shapes and sizes, with different kinds of attachments
and user adjustments. They're very popular for cloud chasing. The most recent entrance
into the marketplace are the pod devices, which contain the e-liquid in a pod. These are very popular,
by the way, among teens. An example of this is the Juul, which not only looks like a USB device but can also be plugged
into a USB outlet to charge. Many teens do not even think
that these are e-cigarettes, which has led to the use of terms
like "juuling" instead of "vaping." Many of these devices are so discreet
and produce so little vapor that teens are using them in classrooms and hiding them in objects
like Sharpie pens, their clothes, their books. Now, many teens think
that these devices produce water vapor, and therefore, they are safe to use. But this could not be
further from the truth. What is produced is not even a vapor, it's an aerosol, and let me tell you, the difference
is quite pronounced. Aerosols contain many finely suspended
particles of liquids and gases that are created
from whatever is in the e-liquid. So an aerosol could contain
propylene glycol and glycerin, which are solvents in the e-liquid. Now, these solvents are known
to be safe for edible use, so for use in products that you eat, but we know very little about their safety
following long-term inhalational exposure. The e-liquids can also contain alcohol, sometimes in high levels, and inhaling alcohol is known
to have toxic effects on the brain. I told you earlier that the e-liquids
contain over 15,000 different flavors. Here are some examples, some with very catchy but familiar names
like "Skittles" and "Fruit Loops," and others with more exotic names
like "Dragon's Milk" and "Tiger's Blood" and "Unicorn Puke." The e-liquid or the aerosol
can also contain metallic particles like chromium, cadmium and lead. These are generated
from the heating coil in the devices and are also known to have
many toxic effects on vital organs. So no, let me make this very clear: what is produced is definitely
not water vapor. Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine
through e-cigarettes is also very concerning. The teen brain is very sensitive
to even low levels of nicotine and gets very easily addicted. In fact, we have known for a long time that 90 percent of smokers start smoking
cigarettes prior to the age of 18. Those who start early are more addicted
and have a harder time quitting smoking. In other words, and to quote
a past FDA commissioner, "Nicotine addiction ...
is a pediatric disease." E-cigarettes can expose teens
to a lot of nicotine. Many of these devices contain
the amount of nicotine that is in a full pack of cigarettes. The more recent pod devices
contain a nicotine salt, which has a smoother taste
and is much easier to use and can produce rapid increases
in brain nicotine levels. Teens who use e-cigarettes regularly
report symptoms of craving -- feeling anxious when they don't
have their e-cigarettes. All these are hallmarks
of a behavioral addiction. E-cigarettes are not only addictive but they also affect
many other organs in the body. So nicotine, which is
in e-cigarettes, for example, binds to a receptor called
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which plays a key role in the functioning
of almost all organ systems in the human body. And chronic exposure to nicotine
changes the functioning of these systems. So as an example, chronic exposure to nicotine decreases
the flexibility of the blood vessels and changes how the heart responds
to acute challenges like stress. The teen brain is not only sensitive
to the addictive effects of nicotine but also to its toxic effects. In adolescent animals, nicotine
is a very well-established neurotoxin, and it decreases learning,
memory and attention processes and increases hyperactivity symptoms. Teens who use tobacco products
are more likely to use marijuana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety
as a teen or as an adult. So nicotine addiction through e-cigarettes
could be leading them down the path of other addictions
and other mental health problems. Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine
also produces epigenetic changes, or heritable changes in gene expression, for example, in the genes
involved in asthma. So teens who use nicotine may not only
be harming themselves but they could be harming
their future generations. You know, the very existence
of e-cigarettes could have led to an entire generation
of nicotine-addicted youth. Easy access to these devices
could have led to more experimentation with marijuana and many other
vaporizable substances by youth. While there is no doubt that providing
smokers with a cleaner form of nicotine is and should continue
to be a critical goal, we still do not know if these devices
help smokers quit smoking, and we know very little about
the long-term effects of these devices. What we do know is that youth --
lots of youth -- are using these devices. In fact, the FDA commissioner
recently used the term "epidemic" to describe e-cigarette use in the US. While trying to solve one huge
public health problem, cigarette smoking, we may have created another colossal one. Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years
around cigarette smoking led to a cigarette epidemic and many,
many cigarette-related diseases. We do not want to repeat
the same mistakes with e-cigarettes. So now is the time for action, for regulations that address the appeal
and access of these devices to youth. Do smokers really need 15,000
kid-friendly flavors to quit smoking? Do they need so many different
kinds of devices? Is it a good idea to have devices
which are so easy to hide and so easy to use? We recently heard that the FDA plans
to introduce stricter regulations on sales of these devices
that contain e-liquid flavors in retail locations like convenience
stores and gas stations, and also introduce stricter regulations on sales of devices
to minors over the internet. Is this going to be sufficient to change
this rapid increase in youth uptake? We need to ask and answer
such critical questions. Now is also the time for a serious
public education campaign. Teens and their parents need to know that while e-cigarettes may contain
less toxins than cigarettes, they're certainly not benign. Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals
produced by these devices could be changing them in ways
they may not like and setting them up for future
unknown toxicities and health problems. You know, when I said earlier that e-cigarettes were a perfect fit
for the smartphone generation, I was not kidding. We live in a technology-crazed world, where the latest device
and technology gets a lot of attention just because it is technology
and because it is the latest thing. More and more over the next few years
and for the rest of our lives, we are going to see technologies
coming into the marketplace that may not raise
any health flags at first, simply because they don't look unhealthy or they're not a medical device. For example, we could see devices that may make it easier
to go longer without sleep or help us lose weight -- a personal goal of mine -- or achieve any number of other goals that we as consumers
are very, very interested in. But many of these devices may come
with unacceptable risks to our own health. So if we want to protect our health
and the health of our children, perhaps we should get out of the habit of automatically celebrating
such new technology and get into the habit of looking
at them with a critical eye, perhaps even through a medical lens. Because, you know something? Our health, the health of our children
and our future generations is far too valuable
to let it go up in smoke -- or even in aerosol. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
"It gets easier, right?" These are the words
I often hear from young parents who are new to the game
of worrying about their children. I tell them that it doesn't. It gets different, but there's always something
to worry about as parents. I remember how I would lie
half-awake at night listening to my son breathe when he was young and had asthma, and then, when he was a teen, until I heard the front door chime open, and I knew that he was home safe. Worrying about our kids
comes with the territory. Now, many of these worries
are about basic issues, like what they eat,
where they are, who they're with. But we also need to keep an eye on
new behaviors and fads. The latest craze is something
that may not yet be on everyone's radar as a serious health concern, and that is the newfound
popularity of vaping, or inhaling sweet aerosols produced by vaporizing
e-liquids in e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, or "vapes,"
as they are commonly called, are flying off the shelves like candy. This year, the e-cigarette
market is expected to drive 26 billion dollars in sales worldwide. Over the next six years, that volume is expected to double. We have a lot of serious concerns
about the health impact of vaping, and unfortunately,
not nearly enough answers. This becomes even more concerning
when you think of who uses e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use, at least in the US, has grown rapidly among youth
and young adults -- our kids, our most vulnerable population. There was a 900 percent growth
in the use of e-cigarettes by youth between 2012 and 2015. The most recent estimates suggest that approximately 3.6 million
high school and middle school students have used e-cigarettes in the US. Now, e-cigarettes were originally created to offer smokers a cleaner
form of nicotine to help with their cigarette addiction. In the US, these devices
come under the FDA's jurisdiction as a tobacco product. But the science on these devices
has not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth, so regulations on the components
of these devices and e-liquids are lagging. Current regulations do restrict
sales of these devices to anyone under the age of 18, but these do not seem
to have had much of an impact on the explosion in the use
of these devices by teens. You know, the first time
I heard of and saw an e-cigarette, I knew right away
that teens would love it. These devices are technology on a stick, a perfect fit for
the smartphone generation -- small, rechargeable, easy to use,
easy to modify, nice smelling -- some even sync with your smartphone
to let you know how much you have vaped. Even I was very drawn
to these very clever devices. And since I had spent a long time
researching teen and adult addictions, I immediately realized that these devices
fit perfectly into the teen psyche. Teens are impulsive,
and they love to try new things. They're also craving independence,
and they love to make things their own. E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly by allowing them the chance
to both innovate and personalize their vape experience. They can choose from over 15,000
different e-liquid flavors and multiple nicotine concentrations. They can even create their own
nicotine flavor combination. They can change how much vapor
is produced from these devices by modifying the puff volume
and the constituents and the power and temperature
of the devices. They can even use these devices
for "cloud chasing." Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks or smoke tricks, involves producing large vape clouds
with quirky shapes and names, like rings, dragons, ghosts ... Cloud chasers can even participate
in cloud competitions and win prizes for creating
the most innovative shaped clouds. Teens can also change the strength
and throat hit from the vapor by either vaporizing the e-liquid
at higher temperatures or dripping the e-liquid
directly onto a heated coil. They can even use these devices
for marijuana vaping. And since the devices

**Transcript**:
The attacking infantry advances steadily, their elephants already having 
broken the defensive line. The king tries to retreat, but enemy 
cavalry flanks him from the rear. Escape is impossible. But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game. Over the roughly one-and-a-half millennia 
of its existence, chess has been known as a tool 
of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, 
and a benchmark of genius. While our earliest records of chess 
are in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins 
lie a century earlier. Supposedly, when the youngest prince 
of the Gupta Empire was killed in battle, his brother devised a way of representing
the scene to their grieving mother. Set on the 8x8 ashtapada board used for
other popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two key features: different rules for moving 
different types of pieces, and a single king piece whose fate 
determined the outcome. The game was originally 
known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions." But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name 
and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning 
king, and “checkmate” from "shah mat," or “the king is helpless.” After the 7th century Islamic conquest 
of Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Transcending its role as a 
tactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source 
of poetic imagery. Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms 
to describe political power. Ruling caliphs became avid 
players themselves. And historian al-Mas’udi considered the 
game a testament to human free will compared to games of chance. Medieval trade along the Silk Road carried
the game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local variants developed. In China, chess pieces were placed at 
intersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native 
strategy game Go. The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw 
an 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces 
could be used by the opposing player. But it was in Europe that chess began to 
take on its modern form. By 1000 AD, the game had become part 
of courtly education. Chess was used as an allegory for different social classes performing 
their proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted 
in their new context. At the same time, the Church remained 
suspicious of games. Moralists cautioned against devoting 
too much time to them, with chess even being briefly 
banned in France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into
the form we know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was 
recast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge 
of strong female leaders. This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings 
and endgames appeared. Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game 
moved from royal courts to coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression 
of creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays. This "Romantic" style reached its peak 
in the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen 
and both rooks. But the emergence of formal competitive 
play in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would 
eventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international 
competition, chess took on a new 
geopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources
to cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest 
of the century. But the player who would truly upset 
Russian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing computers had been 
developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph 
over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine 
had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of 
consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products 
of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide
us out of this apparent checkmate.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: "What was the original name of the game of chess in Sanskrit?" 

Although this question does not directly ask about the origin of chess, the correct answer "Chaturanga" is related to the game's origin in India, as mentioned in the transcript. The ground truth MCQ asks about the location where chess is believed to have been invented, and the correct answer is "India." 

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the location of chess's origin. Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is most closely related to the topic.

**Transcript**:
The attacking infantry advances steadily, their elephants already having 
broken the defensive line. The king tries to retreat, but enemy 
cavalry flanks him from the rear. Escape is impossible. But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game. Over the roughly one-and-a-half millennia 
of its existence, chess has been known as a tool 
of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, 
and a benchmark of genius. While our earliest records of chess 
are in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins 
lie a century earlier. Supposedly, when the youngest prince 
of the Gupta Empire was killed in battle, his brother devised a way of representing
the scene to their grieving mother. Set on the 8x8 ashtapada board used for
other popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two key features: different rules for moving 
different types of pieces, and a single king piece whose fate 
determined the outcome. The game was originally 
known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions." But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name 
and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning 
king, and “checkmate” from "shah mat," or “the king is helpless.” After the 7th century Islamic conquest 
of Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Transcending its role as a 
tactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source 
of poetic imagery. Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms 
to describe political power. Ruling caliphs became avid 
players themselves. And historian al-Mas’udi considered the 
game a testament to human free will compared to games of chance. Medieval trade along the Silk Road carried
the game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local variants developed. In China, chess pieces were placed at 
intersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native 
strategy game Go. The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw 
an 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces 
could be used by the opposing player. But it was in Europe that chess began to 
take on its modern form. By 1000 AD, the game had become part 
of courtly education. Chess was used as an allegory for different social classes performing 
their proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted 
in their new context. At the same time, the Church remained 
suspicious of games. Moralists cautioned against devoting 
too much time to them, with chess even being briefly 
banned in France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into
the form we know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was 
recast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge 
of strong female leaders. This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings 
and endgames appeared. Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game 
moved from royal courts to coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression 
of creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays. This "Romantic" style reached its peak 
in the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen 
and both rooks. But the emergence of formal competitive 
play in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would 
eventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international 
competition, chess took on a new 
geopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources
to cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest 
of the century. But the player who would truly upset 
Russian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing computers had been 
developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph 
over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine 
had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of 
consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products 
of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide
us out of this apparent checkmate.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the military divisions represented in the original game of chess. Question 2 of the generated MCQs asks about the original name of the game of chess in Sanskrit, which is "Chaturanga" meaning "four divisions." While this question does not directly ask about the military divisions, it is related to the concept of the original game.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ. 

If you would like, I can try to generate new MCQs that match the ground truth MCQ.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the cleft shape of the bishop's mitre, which is not mentioned in the transcript or any of the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of chess pieces and their origins, I would select Question 6: What change occurred in the game of chess during the 15th century? Options: A. The queen became a weaker piece, B. The advisor became a more powerful queen, C. The king became more mobile, D. The pawns became more powerful.

This question is not directly related to the bishop's mitre, but it does discuss changes to chess pieces during the 15th century, which might be tangentially related to the evolution of chess pieces and their designs.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 3 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of discussing historical aspects of chess. However, a more relevant match is not present among the provided options.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the discussion of historical chess variations, I would choose Question 3, but with a clarification that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly asks about historical chess variations, which is not present among the provided options.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a countdown. On August 14th, 1947, a woman in Bombay goes into labor 
as the clock ticks towards midnight. Across India, people hold their breath 
for the declaration of independence after nearly two centuries of British 
occupation and rule. And at the stroke of midnight, a squirming infant and two new 
nations are born in perfect synchronicity. These events form the foundation 
of "Midnight’s Children," a dazzling novel by the British-Indian 
author Salman Rushdie. The baby who is the exact same age 
as the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over 
30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time 
to speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: 
Saleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related 
to the time of his birth. And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around 
the stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, 
a spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, 
a gifted warrior. With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a 
vast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step 
through time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender 
when immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins. Saleem acts as a delightful guide 
to magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day 
of celebration, it also marks a turbulent period 
in Indian history. In 1948, the leader of the Indian 
independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided 
with Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India 
and Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of 
the Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment 
of Bangladesh in 1971 and the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi. This vast historical frame is one 
reason why "Midnight’s Children" is considered one of the most illuminating
works of postcolonial literature ever written. This genre typically addresses the 
experience of people living in colonized and formerly colonized countries, and explores the fallout through themes 
like revolution, migration, and identity. Rushdie, who like Saleem was born in 1947,
was educated in India and Britain, and is renowned for his cross-continental 
histories, political commentary, and magical realism. He enriches "Midnight’s Children" 
with a plethora of Indian and Pakistani cultural references, from family traditions to food, 
religion and folktales. Scribbling by night under the 
watchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes 
that of "1001 Nights," where a woman named Scheherazade 
tells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, 
of alternative realities.” Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with 
multiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading 
a rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in-
the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens 
after I’ve gone which would not have happened 
if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional 
in this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six-
hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, 
you’ll have to swallow a world.” Saleem’s narrative often has 
a breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the 
cosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever 
condense history into a single narrative. His mind-bending plot and 
shapeshifting characters have garnered continuing 
fascination and praise. Not only did "Midnight’s Children" win 
the prestigious Man Booker Prize in its year of publication, but in a 2008 competition that pitted 
all 39 winners against each other, it was named the best of all the winners. In a masterpiece of epic proportions, Rushdie reveals that there 
are no singular truths— rather, it’s wiser to believe in several 
versions of reality at once, hold many lives in the 
palms of our hands, and experience multiple moments 
in a single stroke of the clock.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific time period over which the novel "Midnight's Children" is set.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it still does not match the ground truth MCQ. Question 1 asks about the event occurring in India as the clock ticks towards midnight on August 14th, 1947, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the time period over which the novel is set.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 1 is the closest, with the understanding that it still does not match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a countdown. On August 14th, 1947, a woman in Bombay goes into labor 
as the clock ticks towards midnight. Across India, people hold their breath 
for the declaration of independence after nearly two centuries of British 
occupation and rule. And at the stroke of midnight, a squirming infant and two new 
nations are born in perfect synchronicity. These events form the foundation 
of "Midnight’s Children," a dazzling novel by the British-Indian 
author Salman Rushdie. The baby who is the exact same age 
as the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over 
30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time 
to speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: 
Saleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related 
to the time of his birth. And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around 
the stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, 
a spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, 
a gifted warrior. With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a 
vast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step 
through time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender 
when immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins. Saleem acts as a delightful guide 
to magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day 
of celebration, it also marks a turbulent period 
in Indian history. In 1948, the leader of the Indian 
independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided 
with Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India 
and Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of 
the Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment 
of Bangladesh in 1971 and the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi. This vast historical frame is one 
reason why "Midnight’s Children" is considered one of the most illuminating
works of postcolonial literature ever written. This genre typically addresses the 
experience of people living in colonized and formerly colonized countries, and explores the fallout through themes 
like revolution, migration, and identity. Rushdie, who like Saleem was born in 1947,
was educated in India and Britain, and is renowned for his cross-continental 
histories, political commentary, and magical realism. He enriches "Midnight’s Children" 
with a plethora of Indian and Pakistani cultural references, from family traditions to food, 
religion and folktales. Scribbling by night under the 
watchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes 
that of "1001 Nights," where a woman named Scheherazade 
tells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, 
of alternative realities.” Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with 
multiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading 
a rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in-
the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens 
after I’ve gone which would not have happened 
if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional 
in this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six-
hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, 
you’ll have to swallow a world.” Saleem’s narrative often has 
a breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the 
cosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever 
condense history into a single narrative. His mind-bending plot and 
shapeshifting characters have garnered continuing 
fascination and praise. Not only did "Midnight’s Children" win 
the prestigious Man Booker Prize in its year of publication, but in a 2008 competition that pitted 
all 39 winners against each other, it was named the best of all the winners. In a masterpiece of epic proportions, Rushdie reveals that there 
are no singular truths— rather, it’s wiser to believe in several 
versions of reality at once, hold many lives in the 
palms of our hands, and experience multiple moments 
in a single stroke of the clock.

**Transcript**:
Consider the spot where you’re sitting. Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at 
the bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, 
infernal landscape. But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous 
cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the 
biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies. Seemingly empty regions 
of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain 
threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster 
and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn 
hydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow 
off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas 
and dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, 
and send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments,
bits of rock, and, further out, ices. We’ve observed thousands of these disks 
in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together
into larger and larger masses. Dust grains 100 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called 
the van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons 
shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, 
and a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can 
only hold tiny things together. And there’s a problem: once dust 
clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should 
constantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow
is the first mystery of dust bunnies. One theory looks to electrostatic charge 
to answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, 
and UV photons knock electrons off of gas 
atoms within the disk, creating positive ions 
and negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes 
clusters together, like repels like 
and slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions 
they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, 
they’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy 
particles can knock more electrons off of some 
dust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, 
and clusters grow rapidly. But before long we reach 
another set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies 
eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid 
pellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how 
or why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form,
how do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before 
are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together 
by gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the 
mass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape 
an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated 
by your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the 
outside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded
by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust. Eventually the chondrule pellets get 
cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold 
themselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow 
into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today. Ultimately, the seeds of 
everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position 
within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large 
series of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t 
have been right for the formation of life on our planet.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options provided. However, based on the content of the transcript, the closest match can be inferred.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "A star is born when" and the correct option is "A collapsing dust cloud becomes hot enough to burn hydrogen." 

From the generated MCQs, none directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 5 mentions the electrostatic charge helping dust clusters grow, which is related to the formation of stars, but it does not directly answer the question of when a star is born.

Since there is no direct match, I will choose the question that is closest to the topic of star formation. Question 5 is the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

If I had to choose, I would say that the closest match is not present in the generated MCQs. However, if I had to select one, I would choose Question 5, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Consider the spot where you’re sitting. Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at 
the bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, 
infernal landscape. But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous 
cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the 
biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies. Seemingly empty regions 
of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain 
threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster 
and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn 
hydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow 
off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas 
and dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, 
and send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments,
bits of rock, and, further out, ices. We’ve observed thousands of these disks 
in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together
into larger and larger masses. Dust grains 100 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called 
the van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons 
shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, 
and a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can 
only hold tiny things together. And there’s a problem: once dust 
clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should 
constantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow
is the first mystery of dust bunnies. One theory looks to electrostatic charge 
to answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, 
and UV photons knock electrons off of gas 
atoms within the disk, creating positive ions 
and negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes 
clusters together, like repels like 
and slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions 
they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, 
they’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy 
particles can knock more electrons off of some 
dust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, 
and clusters grow rapidly. But before long we reach 
another set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies 
eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid 
pellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how 
or why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form,
how do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before 
are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together 
by gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the 
mass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape 
an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated 
by your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the 
outside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded
by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust. Eventually the chondrule pellets get 
cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold 
themselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow 
into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today. Ultimately, the seeds of 
everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position 
within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large 
series of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t 
have been right for the formation of life on our planet.

**Transcript**:
Hercules, 
the strongest man alive with a mighty heart to match. Orpheus, 
charmer of nature and master of music. Castor and Pollux, 
the twin tricksters hatched from an egg. The Boreads, 
sons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air. For untold times 
these heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went. But none of their adventures 
was so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason. Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias 
had ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly 
from Jason’s grandfather. When Jason returned 
to his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king 
set him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal 
the golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose. If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne. Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon 
he had assembled a not-so-motley crew. These heroes, alongside countless sailors,
soothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves 
the Argonauts after their sturdy ship. But the path ahead 
was marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes. Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women 
who had killed all the island’s men. As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them
with a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason 
fathering twins with the queen. The rest of the crew also found themselves
embroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them 
for not behaving like heroes. Eventually, 
they sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, 
six-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed 
the Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down 
from the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray. Bolstered by their victory, 
the triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back 
to the island several stormy nights later. In the tempest, the Doliones 
thought these new arrivals invaders. The Argonauts were similarly unaware 
of their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, 
slaying wave after wave of foe. But the morning light 
revealed a horrible truth: their victims 
were none other than their previous hosts. Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew 
to be distracted, this time at a terrible cost. Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved 
to focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous. When Hercules’ squire 
was abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence 
of his most powerful crewmate. The remaining Argonauts 
continued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man 
surrounded by a swirl of harpies. This was Phineas, 
a seer cursed by Zeus to endure 
old age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away 
his prophecies. Moved by his plight, 
the wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas 
with a brief respite from his punishment. In return, the seer told them how to overcome
the terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks 
that reduced ships to splinters. But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver 
past the mouth of hell, around the island 
of the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies. These adventures cost the crew 
both in men and morale– and some feared 
they might be losing their minds. Upon reaching the clashing rocks, 
the exhausted crew quaked with fear. But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads. The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake 
to emerge unscathed. With this narrow escape, the Argonauts 
finally had Colchis in their sights. Yet while Jason rested 
and celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time 
among them was drawing to a close. As the fleece gleamed in his mind, he knew 
he would have to retrieve it alone. But he could not guess 
that this final task would have the most horrible price of all.

**Transcript**:
Hercules, 
the strongest man alive with a mighty heart to match. Orpheus, 
charmer of nature and master of music. Castor and Pollux, 
the twin tricksters hatched from an egg. The Boreads, 
sons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air. For untold times 
these heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went. But none of their adventures 
was so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason. Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias 
had ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly 
from Jason’s grandfather. When Jason returned 
to his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king 
set him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal 
the golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose. If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne. Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon 
he had assembled a not-so-motley crew. These heroes, alongside countless sailors,
soothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves 
the Argonauts after their sturdy ship. But the path ahead 
was marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes. Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women 
who had killed all the island’s men. As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them
with a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason 
fathering twins with the queen. The rest of the crew also found themselves
embroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them 
for not behaving like heroes. Eventually, 
they sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, 
six-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed 
the Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down 
from the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray. Bolstered by their victory, 
the triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back 
to the island several stormy nights later. In the tempest, the Doliones 
thought these new arrivals invaders. The Argonauts were similarly unaware 
of their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, 
slaying wave after wave of foe. But the morning light 
revealed a horrible truth: their victims 
were none other than their previous hosts. Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew 
to be distracted, this time at a terrible cost. Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved 
to focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous. When Hercules’ squire 
was abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence 
of his most powerful crewmate. The remaining Argonauts 
continued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man 
surrounded by a swirl of harpies. This was Phineas, 
a seer cursed by Zeus to endure 
old age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away 
his prophecies. Moved by his plight, 
the wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas 
with a brief respite from his punishment. In return, the seer told them how to overcome
the terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks 
that reduced ships to splinters. But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver 
past the mouth of hell, around the island 
of the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies. These adventures cost the crew 
both in men and morale– and some feared 
they might be losing their minds. Upon reaching the clashing rocks, 
the exhausted crew quaked with fear. But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads. The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake 
to emerge unscathed. With this narrow escape, the Argonauts 
finally had Colchis in their sights. Yet while Jason rested 
and celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time 
among them was drawing to a close. As the fleece gleamed in his mind, he knew 
he would have to retrieve it alone. But he could not guess 
that this final task would have the most horrible price of all.

**Transcript**:
Despite a serene sunset 
on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks. The year is 1676, and the Treaty of 
Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
and the Ottoman Empire. But as Stepan and his men ride 
towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds. Having made their home in the Wild Fields 
north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic 
word for "free man"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most 
formidable military forces. Composed of hunters, fishermen, 
nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these 
fertile unclaimed lands. Yet this freedom has proven increasingly 
difficult to maintain. Their decades-long strategy of shifting 
alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning 
of their lands. In a desperate bid to reclaim independence
and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro 
Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire. This alliance successfully freed the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but 
their victory was a bitter one. Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies 
ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery. And outrage at allying with Muslims 
against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support. Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing 
on what their next move should be. Until then, Stepan must keep order. With his musket and curved saber, 
he cuts an imposing figure. He surveys his battalion of 180 men. Most are Orthodox Christians 
and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian. But there are also Greeks, Tatars, 
and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions 
on recent events. Officially, all of Stepan’s men have 
sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military 
training and remaining unmarried. In practice, some are part-timers, holding
more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby 
villages, outside Cossack lands. Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not 
broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life. Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with 
the tide of military action. The settlement is remarkably well-
organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, 
as Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way 
to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other 
battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several 
hundred man regiment. Inside, the men dine on dried fish, 
sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine. Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to 
lighten the mood with his bandura. But before long, an argument 
has broken out. One of his men has raised 
a toast to Doroshenko. Stepan cuts him off. The room is silent until he raises 
his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance 
with Moscow against the Turks. Stepan plans to support him, and 
he expects his men to do the same. Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, 
or general council meeting. Stepan and the others make their 
way towards the church square— the center of Sich life. Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused 
crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman 
camp completely vulnerable on one side. Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will 
ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, 
and bring unity to the Wild Fields. As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed 
sense of brotherhood. Over the next 200 years, these 
freedom fighters would take on many foes. And tragically, they would eventually become the 
oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed. But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of 
independence and defiance. As the Russian painter 
Ilya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, 
equality, and fraternity so deeply.”

Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire. This alliance successfully freed the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but 
their victory was a bitter one. Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies 
ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery. And outrage at allying with Muslims 
against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support. Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing 
on what their next move should be. Until then, Stepan must keep order. With his musket and curved saber, 
he cuts an imposing figure. He surveys his battalion of 180 men. Most are Orthodox Christians 
and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian. But there are also Greeks, Tatars, 
and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions 
on recent events. Officially, all of Stepan’s men have 
sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military 
training and remaining unmarried. In practice, some are part-timers, holding
more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby 
villages, outside Cossack lands. Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not 
broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life. Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with 
the tide of military action. The settlement is remarkably well-
organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, 
as Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way 
to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other 
battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several 
hundred man regiment. Inside, the men dine on dried fish, 
sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine. Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to 
lighten the mood with his bandura. But before long, an argument 
has broken out. One of his men has raised 
a toast to Doroshenko. Stepan cuts him off. The room is silent until he raises 
his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance 
with Moscow against the Turks. Stepan plans to support him, and 
he expects his men to do the same. Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, 
or general council meeting. Stepan and the others make their 
way towards the church square— the center of Sich life. Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused 
crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman 
camp completely vulnerable on one side. Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will 
ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, 
and bring unity to the Wild Fields. As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed 
sense of brotherhood. Over the next 200 years, these 
freedom fighters would take on many foes. And tragically, they would eventually become the 
oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed. But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of 
independence and defiance. As the Russian painter 
Ilya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, 
equality, and fraternity so deeply.”

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: Who is the new hetman that Stepan plans to support? Options: A. Petro Doroshenko, B. Ivan Sirko, C. Stepan, D. Yuri.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the "new hetman" rather than the general term for a Cossack leader. 

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the title of a Cossack leader, which is not present in the provided options.

But among the given options, Question 7 is the closest match as it mentions the term "hetman" which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Despite a serene sunset 
on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks. The year is 1676, and the Treaty of 
Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
and the Ottoman Empire. But as Stepan and his men ride 
towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds. Having made their home in the Wild Fields 
north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic 
word for "free man"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most 
formidable military forces. Composed of hunters, fishermen, 
nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these 
fertile unclaimed lands. Yet this freedom has proven increasingly 
difficult to maintain. Their decades-long strategy of shifting 
alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning 
of their lands. In a desperate bid to reclaim independence

**Transcript**:
“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm
that keeps changing directions. You change direction 
but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance 
with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something 
that blew in from far away… This storm is you.
Something inside of you.” This quote, from the first chapter 
of Haruki Murakami’s "Kafka on the Shore," captures the teenage protagonist's 
turmoil. Desperate to escape his tyrannical father and the family curse 
he feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka 
after his favorite author and runs away from home. But memories of a missing mother, along with dreams 
that haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun. Published in Japanese in 2002 and translated into English 
three years later, "Kafka on the Shore" 
is an epic literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories,
and magical underworlds. Readers delight in discovering 
how the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters 
and eerie coincidences fit together. Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest centering on an old man 
named Satoru Nakata. After awakening from a coma 
he went into during the Second World War, Nakata loses 
the ability to read and write– but gains a mysterious knack 
for talking to cats. When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown onto a dangerous path 
that runs parallel to Kafka’s. Soon prophecies come true, 
portals to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches 
begin raining from the sky. But what ties these two characters 
together– and is it a force 
either one of them can control? The collision of different worlds
is a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work. His novels and short stories 
often forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, 
and Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up 
during the post-World War II American occupation of Japan. The shadow of war 
hung over his life as it does his fiction; "Kafka on the Shore" 
features biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws 
from multiple cultural traditions. References to Western society 
and Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion 
to food and ghost stories. He has a penchant 
for musical references, too, especially in "Kafka on the Shore." As the runaway Kafka 
wanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: Why does the teenage protagonist in "Kafka on the Shore" rename himself Kafka? 

Although the options do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks why the boy renames himself Kafka and runs away from home, while the generated MCQ only asks why he renames himself Kafka. However, the correct answer to the generated MCQ (after his favorite author) is related to the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (he is trying to outrun a curse, and renaming himself is part of that process).

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the reason for the protagonist's decision to run away from home. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm
that keeps changing directions. You change direction 
but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance 
with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something 
that blew in from far away… This storm is you.
Something inside of you.” This quote, from the first chapter 
of Haruki Murakami’s "Kafka on the Shore," captures the teenage protagonist's 
turmoil. Desperate to escape his tyrannical father and the family curse 
he feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka 
after his favorite author and runs away from home. But memories of a missing mother, along with dreams 
that haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun. Published in Japanese in 2002 and translated into English 
three years later, "Kafka on the Shore" 
is an epic literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories,
and magical underworlds. Readers delight in discovering 
how the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters 
and eerie coincidences fit together. Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest centering on an old man 
named Satoru Nakata. After awakening from a coma 
he went into during the Second World War, Nakata loses 
the ability to read and write– but gains a mysterious knack 
for talking to cats. When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown onto a dangerous path 
that runs parallel to Kafka’s. Soon prophecies come true, 
portals to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches 
begin raining from the sky. But what ties these two characters 
together– and is it a force 
either one of them can control? The collision of different worlds
is a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work. His novels and short stories 
often forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, 
and Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up 
during the post-World War II American occupation of Japan. The shadow of war 
hung over his life as it does his fiction; "Kafka on the Shore" 
features biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws 
from multiple cultural traditions. References to Western society 
and Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion 
to food and ghost stories. He has a penchant 
for musical references, too, especially in "Kafka on the Shore." As the runaway Kafka 
wanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge 
in an exquisite private library. While he spends his days 
poring over old books and contemplating a strange painting 
and the library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him 
to classical music like Schubert. This musical sensibility

**Transcript**:
The contents of this metal cylinder could
either revolutionize technology or be completely useless— it all depends on whether we can harness
the strange physics of matter at very, very small scales. To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment 
precisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against
vibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening
or closing doors. The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air. Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, 
reachable by tiny laser beams. Inside are ultra-sensitive particles
that make up a quantum computer. So what makes these particles 
worth the effort? In theory, quantum computers could 
outstrip the computational limits of classical computers. Classical computers process 
data in the form of bits. Each bit can switch between two states 
labeled zero and one. A quantum computer uses something 
called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, 
and what’s called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information 
than one or zero. You can think of these positions as 
points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere 
represent one and zero. A bit can only switch between 
these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere. We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves 
into a zero or a one. But even though we can’t observe the 
qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform 
particular operations while in this state. So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly
more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will 
theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a
classical computer would need bits. The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic 
and subatomic particles. These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the 
state of the qubit. Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature 
and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles. That’s why quantum computers need 
such an elaborate set up. It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers 
remains largely theoretical. So far, we can only control a few qubits 
in the same place at the same time. There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum 
states effectively: the types of particles a quantum 
computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles. For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits. A trapped ion quantum computer uses 
ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The ions are housed in a trap made 
of electrical fields. Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what 
operation to make by causing the qubit state 
to rotate on the sphere. To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15? In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether
the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. An imaging system collects these photons
and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5. Superconducting qubit quantum computers
do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits 
instead of an ion trap. The states of each electrical circuit 
translate to the state of the qubit. They can be manipulated with electrical
inputs in the form of microwaves. So: the qubits come from either ions 
or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves. Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages. Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
control each with precision. We can’t currently contain enough ions 
in a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to 
connect many smaller traps that communicate with each 
other via photons rather than trying to create one big trap. Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make
operations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number 
of circuits in a computer than the number of ions. But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan. And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the 
environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states. But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making 
computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask what quantum computers use to encode information, it does address the key difference between a classical computer bit and a quantum computer qubit, which is closely related to the concept of information encoding in quantum computers. The correct answer to Question 2 (B. A qubit can switch between 0, 1, and a superposition, while a bit can only switch between 0 and 1) implies that quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states, to encode information.

**Transcript**:
The contents of this metal cylinder could
either revolutionize technology or be completely useless— it all depends on whether we can harness
the strange physics of matter at very, very small scales. To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment 
precisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against
vibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening
or closing doors. The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air. Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, 
reachable by tiny laser beams. Inside are ultra-sensitive particles
that make up a quantum computer. So what makes these particles 
worth the effort? In theory, quantum computers could 
outstrip the computational limits of classical computers. Classical computers process 
data in the form of bits. Each bit can switch between two states 
labeled zero and one. A quantum computer uses something 
called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, 
and what’s called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information 
than one or zero. You can think of these positions as 
points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere 
represent one and zero. A bit can only switch between 
these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere. We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves 
into a zero or a one. But even though we can’t observe the 
qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform 
particular operations while in this state. So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly
more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will 
theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a
classical computer would need bits. The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic 
and subatomic particles. These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the 
state of the qubit. Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature 
and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles. That’s why quantum computers need 
such an elaborate set up. It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers 
remains largely theoretical. So far, we can only control a few qubits 
in the same place at the same time. There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum 
states effectively: the types of particles a quantum 
computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles. For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits. A trapped ion quantum computer uses 
ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The ions are housed in a trap made 
of electrical fields. Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what 
operation to make by causing the qubit state 
to rotate on the sphere. To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15? In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether
the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. An imaging system collects these photons
and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5. Superconducting qubit quantum computers
do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits 
instead of an ion trap. The states of each electrical circuit 
translate to the state of the qubit. They can be manipulated with electrical
inputs in the form of microwaves. So: the qubits come from either ions 
or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves. Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages. Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
control each with precision. We can’t currently contain enough ions

The ground truth MCQ asks about the usefulness of quantum computers, specifically their ability to carry out complex calculations. Question 2, on the other hand, asks about the key difference between a classical computer bit and a quantum computer qubit. While not directly related to the usefulness of quantum computers, it does touch on the unique properties of qubits that enable quantum computers to perform complex calculations.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that best matches the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest.

**Transcript**:
For millennia, the people of Britain had been using 
bronze to make tools and jewelry, and as a currency for trade. But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing 
social upheaval and an economic crisis— what we would call a recession today. What causes recessions? This question has long been the subject 
of heated debate among economists, and for good reason. A recession can be a mild decline in 
economic activity in a single country that lasts months, a long-lasting downturn with global 
ramifications that last years, or anything in between. Complicating matters further, there are countless variables that 
contribute to an economy’s health, making it difficult to pinpoint 
specific causes. So it helps to start with the big picture: recessions occur when there is a negative 
disruption to the balance between supply and demand. There’s a mismatch between how many 
goods people want to buy, how many products and services producers 
can offer, and the price of the goods and services 
sold, which prompts an economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply 
and demand is reflected in its inflation rates 
and interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services 
get more expensive. Put another way, the value 
of money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought 
to encourage economic activity. But high inflation that isn’t accompanied 
with high demand can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for 
individuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage
of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors 
until the loan is repaid. Low interest rates mean that companies 
can afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest 
in more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase 
costs for producers and consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest 
rates can give us insight into the health 
of the economy, but what causes these fluctuations 
in the first place? The most obvious causes are shocks 
like natural disaster, war, and geopolitical factors. An earthquake, for example, can destroy the infrastructure needed to 
produce important commodities such as oil. That forces the supply side of the economy
to charge more for products that use oil, discouraging demand and potentially 
prompting a recession. But some recessions occur in times of 
economic prosperity— possibly even because 
of economic prosperity. Some economists believe that business 
activity from a market’s expansion can occasionally reach 
an unsustainable level. For example, corporations and consumers 
may borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth 
will help them handle the added burden. But if the economy doesn’t grow as 
quickly as expected, they may end up with more debt 
than they can manage. To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect 
funds from other activities, reducing business activity. Psychology can also contribute 
to a recession. Fear of a recession can become a 
self-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people to pull back investing
and spending. In response, producers might 
cut operating costs to help weather the expected 
decline in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost 
cuts eventually lower wages, leading to even lower demand. Even policy designed to help prevent 
recessions can contribute. When times are tough, governments and 
central banks may print money, increase spending, and lower central bank
interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their 
interest rates, effectively making debt “cheaper” 
to boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable 
and eventually need to be reversed to prevent excessive inflation. That can cause a recession if people have 
become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually
ended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming 
and food production. Modern markets are more complex, making today’s recessions far 
more difficult to navigate. But each recession provides new data to 
help anticipate and respond to future recessions more effectively.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For millennia, the people of Britain had been using 
bronze to make tools and jewelry, and as a currency for trade. But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing 
social upheaval and an economic crisis— what we would call a recession today. What causes recessions? This question has long been the subject 
of heated debate among economists, and for good reason. A recession can be a mild decline in 
economic activity in a single country that lasts months, a long-lasting downturn with global 
ramifications that last years, or anything in between. Complicating matters further, there are countless variables that 
contribute to an economy’s health, making it difficult to pinpoint 
specific causes. So it helps to start with the big picture: recessions occur when there is a negative 
disruption to the balance between supply and demand. There’s a mismatch between how many 
goods people want to buy, how many products and services producers 
can offer, and the price of the goods and services 
sold, which prompts an economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply 
and demand is reflected in its inflation rates 
and interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services 
get more expensive. Put another way, the value 
of money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily 
a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought 
to encourage economic activity. But high inflation that isn’t accompanied 
with high demand can both cause problems for an economy 
and eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for 
individuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage
of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors 
until the loan is repaid. Low interest rates mean that companies 
can afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest 
in more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase 
costs for producers and consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest

**Transcript**:
“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here… ” Inscribed above the Gate of Hell, these ominous words warn dark 
tidings for Dante as he begins his descent into inferno. Yet despite the grim tone, this prophecy sets into motion what is 
perhaps the greatest love story ever told; an epic journey that encompasses both 
the human and the divine. But for Dante to reach 
benevolent salvation, he must first find his way through Hell. This landscape of torture is the setting 
for "Inferno," the first in a three-part narrative poem written by Dante Alighieri 
in the 14th century. Casting himself as the protagonist, Dante travels deeper and deeper 
into Hell’s abyss, witnessing obscene punishments distinct 
to each of its nine realms. Beginning in Limbo, he travels through the
circles of Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy, Violence, and Fraud, to the horrific ninth circle of Treachery, where sinners are trapped under the 
watchful eyes of Satan himself. The following two parts, "Purgatorio" and 
"Paradiso," continue Dante’s journey, as he scales the Mount of Purgatory and ascends the nine celestial 
spheres of Heaven. Written together over 10 years, these 
3 sections comprise the "Divine Comedy"– an allegorical imagining of the soul’s 
journey towards God. But Dante’s "Divine Comedy" is more than 
just religious allegory. It’s also a witty, scathing commentary on 
Italian politics. A soldier and statesman from Florence, 
Dante was staunchly faithful to God, but often critical of the 
Roman Catholic Church. He particularly disliked its rampant 
nepotism and practice of simony, the buying and selling of religious 
favours such as pardons from sin. Many groups took advantage of these 
corrupt customs, but few supported them as much as the 
Guelfi Neri, or Black Guelphs. This was a political and religious faction which sought to expand the pope’s 
political influence. Dante was a member of the Guelfi Bianchi, 
or White Guelphs– who believed Florence needed more 
freedom from Roman influence. As a public representative for the 
White Guelphs, Dante frequently spoke out against 
the pope’s power, until the Black Guelphs leveraged their
position to exile him from Florence in 1302. But rather than silencing him, this lifelong exile led to Dante’s 
greatest critique of all. Dishonored and with little hope of return, the author freely aired his grievances 
with the Church and Italian society. Writing the "Divine Comedy" in Italian, rather than the traditional Latin of the 
educated elite, Dante ensured the widest possible audience
for his biting political commentary. In the "Inferno’s" circle of the Wrathful, Dante eagerly witnesses sinners tear Black Guelph Filippo 
Argenti limb from limb. In the circle of Fraud, Dante converses with a mysterious sinner 
burning in the circle’s hottest flames. He learns that this is Pope Nicholas III, who tells Dante that his two successors 
will take his place when they die— all three guilty of simony and corruption. Despite the bleak and sometimes violent 
imagery in "Inferno," the "Divine Comedy" is also a love story. Though Dante had an arranged marriage with the daughter of a powerful 
Florentine family, he had also been unrequitedly in love with
another woman since he was nine years old: Beatrice Portinari. Despite allegedly meeting just twice, 
she became Dante’s lifelong muse, serving as the inspiration and subject for
many of his works. In fact, it’s Beatrice who launches his 
intrepid journey into the pits of Hell and up the terraces of Mount Purgatory. Portrayed as a powerful, heavenly figure, she leads Dante through "Paradiso’s"
concentric spheres of Heaven until he is finally face-to-face with God. In the centuries since its publication, the "Divine Comedy’s" themes of love, 
sin, and redemption have been embraced by numerous artists– from Auguste Rodin and Salvador Dali, 
to Ezra Pound and Neil Gaiman. And the poet himself received his own 
belated, earthly redemption in 2008, when the city of Florence finally revoked 
Dante’s antiquated exile.

Italian politics. A soldier and statesman from Florence, 
Dante was staunchly faithful to God, but often critical of the 
Roman Catholic Church. He particularly disliked its rampant 
nepotism and practice of simony, the buying and selling of religious 
favours such as pardons from sin. Many groups took advantage of these 
corrupt customs, but few supported them as much as the 
Guelfi Neri, or Black Guelphs. This was a political and religious faction which sought to expand the pope’s 
political influence. Dante was a member of the Guelfi Bianchi, 
or White Guelphs– who believed Florence needed more 
freedom from Roman influence. As a public representative for the 
White Guelphs, Dante frequently spoke out against 
the pope’s power, until the Black Guelphs leveraged their
position to exile him from Florence in 1302. But rather than silencing him, this lifelong exile led to Dante’s 
greatest critique of all. Dishonored and with little hope of return, the author freely aired his grievances 
with the Church and Italian society. Writing the "Divine Comedy" in Italian, rather than the traditional Latin of the 
educated elite, Dante ensured the widest possible audience
for his biting political commentary. In the "Inferno’s" circle of the Wrathful, Dante eagerly witnesses sinners tear Black Guelph Filippo 
Argenti limb from limb. In the circle of Fraud, Dante converses with a mysterious sinner 
burning in the circle’s hottest flames. He learns that this is Pope Nicholas III, who tells Dante that his two successors 
will take his place when they die— all three guilty of simony and corruption. Despite the bleak and sometimes violent 
imagery in "Inferno," the "Divine Comedy" is also a love story. Though Dante had an arranged marriage with the daughter of a powerful 
Florentine family, he had also been unrequitedly in love with
another woman since he was nine years old: Beatrice Portinari. Despite allegedly meeting just twice, 
she became Dante’s lifelong muse, serving as the inspiration and subject for
many of his works. In fact, it’s Beatrice who launches his 
intrepid journey into the pits of Hell and up the terraces of Mount Purgatory. Portrayed as a powerful, heavenly figure, she leads Dante through "Paradiso’s"
concentric spheres of Heaven until he is finally face-to-face with God. In the centuries since its publication, the "Divine Comedy’s" themes of love, 
sin, and redemption have been embraced by numerous artists– from Auguste Rodin and Salvador Dali, 
to Ezra Pound and Neil Gaiman. And the poet himself received his own 
belated, earthly redemption in 2008, when the city of Florence finally revoked 
Dante’s antiquated exile.

**Transcript**:
The royal couple of Haiti rode into their 
coronation to thunderous applause. After receiving his ornate 
crown and scepter, Henry Christophe ascended his throne, 
towering 20 meters in the air. But little did the cheering onlookers 
know that the first king of Haiti would also be its last. Enslaved at birth on the 
island of Grenada, Christophe spent his childhood being 
moved between multiple Caribbean islands. Just 12 years old in 1779, he accompanied his master to aid the 
American revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah. This prolonged siege would be Christophe’s
first encounter with violent revolution. There are few surviving written records about Christophe’s life immediately 
after the war. Over the next decade, we know he worked as a mason 
and a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, 
as Haiti was then known. In 1791, when the colony’s 
slaves rose up in rebellion, Christophe got another opportunity 
to fight for freedom. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebels 
fought against plantation owners, as well as British and Spanish forces 
seeking control of the island. Christophe quickly rose 
through the ranks, proving himself the equal of more 
experienced generals. By 1793, Louverture had successfully liberated 
all of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved people, and by 1801 he’d established the 
island as a semi-autonomous colony. But during this time, Napoleon Bonaparte 
had assumed power in France, and made it his mission to restore 
slavery and French authority throughout the empire. French attempts to reinstate slavery 
met fierce resistance, with General Christophe even 
burning the capital city to prevent military occupation. Finally, the rebellion and an 
outbreak of yellow fever forced French soldiers to withdraw— 
but the fight was not without casualties. Louverture was captured, 
and left to die in a French prison; a fate that Christophe’s nine-year-old son
would share only a few years later. Following the revolution, Christophe and generals Jean-Jacques 
Dessalines and Alexandre Pétion rose to prominent positions 
in the new government. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed 
the emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power 
alienated his supporters. Eventually, Dessalines’ rule incited 
a political conspiracy that ended in his assassination in 1806. The subsequent power struggle led to a 
Civil War, which split the country in two. By 1807, Christophe was governing as 
president of the north in Cap-Haïtien, and Pétion was ruling the south 
from Port-au-Prince. Pétion tried to stay true to the 
revolution’s democratic roots by modeling his republic after 
the United States. He even supported anti-colonial 
revolutionaries in other nations. These policies endeared 
him to his people, but they slowed trade and economic growth. Christophe, conversely, had more 
aggressive plans for an independent Haiti. He redistributed land to the people, while
retaining state control of agriculture. He also established trade with 
many foreign nations, including Great Britain and 
the United States, and pledged non-interference 
with their foreign policies. He even built a massive Citadel in case 
the French tried to invade again. To accomplish all of this, Christophe 
instituted mandatory labor, and to strengthen his authority, 
he crowned himself king in 1811. During his reign, he lived in an 
elegant palace called Sans Souci along with his wife and their 
three remaining children. Christophe’s kingdom oversaw rapid 
development of trade, industry, culture, and education. He imported renowned European 
artists to Haiti’s cultural scene, as well as European teachers, in order 
to establish public education. But while the king was initially 
popular among his subjects, his labor mandates were an 
uncomfortable reminder of the slavery Haitians fought to destroy. Over time, his increasingly authoritarian 
policies lost support, and his opponents to the south 
gained strength. In October 1820, his reign finally 
reached its tragic conclusion. Months after a debilitating stroke 
left him unable to govern, key members of his military 
defected to southern forces. Betrayed and despondent, 
the king committed suicide. Today, the traces of Christophe’s 
complicated history can still be found in the crumbling 
remains of his palaces, and in Haiti’s legacy as the first nation 
to permanently abolish slavery.

**Transcript**:
The royal couple of Haiti rode into their 
coronation to thunderous applause. After receiving his ornate 
crown and scepter, Henry Christophe ascended his throne, 
towering 20 meters in the air. But little did the cheering onlookers 
know that the first king of Haiti would also be its last. Enslaved at birth on the 
island of Grenada, Christophe spent his childhood being 
moved between multiple Caribbean islands. Just 12 years old in 1779, he accompanied his master to aid the 
American revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah. This prolonged siege would be Christophe’s
first encounter with violent revolution. There are few surviving written records about Christophe’s life immediately 
after the war. Over the next decade, we know he worked as a mason 
and a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, 
as Haiti was then known. In 1791, when the colony’s 
slaves rose up in rebellion, Christophe got another opportunity 
to fight for freedom. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebels 
fought against plantation owners, as well as British and Spanish forces 
seeking control of the island. Christophe quickly rose 
through the ranks, proving himself the equal of more 
experienced generals. By 1793, Louverture had successfully liberated 
all of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved people, and by 1801 he’d established the 
island as a semi-autonomous colony. But during this time, Napoleon Bonaparte 
had assumed power in France, and made it his mission to restore 
slavery and French authority throughout the empire. French attempts to reinstate slavery 
met fierce resistance, with General Christophe even 
burning the capital city to prevent military occupation. Finally, the rebellion and an 
outbreak of yellow fever forced French soldiers to withdraw— 
but the fight was not without casualties. Louverture was captured, 
and left to die in a French prison; a fate that Christophe’s nine-year-old son
would share only a few years later. Following the revolution, Christophe and generals Jean-Jacques 
Dessalines and Alexandre Pétion rose to prominent positions 
in the new government. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed 
the emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power 
alienated his supporters. Eventually, Dessalines’ rule incited 
a political conspiracy that ended in his assassination in 1806. The subsequent power struggle led to a 
Civil War, which split the country in two. By 1807, Christophe was governing as 
president of the north in Cap-Haïtien, and Pétion was ruling the south 
from Port-au-Prince. Pétion tried to stay true to the 
revolution’s democratic roots by modeling his republic after 
the United States. He even supported anti-colonial 
revolutionaries in other nations. These policies endeared 
him to his people, but they slowed trade and economic growth. Christophe, conversely, had more 
aggressive plans for an independent Haiti. He redistributed land to the people, while
retaining state control of agriculture. He also established trade with 
many foreign nations, including Great Britain and 
the United States, and pledged non-interference 
with their foreign policies. He even built a massive Citadel in case 
the French tried to invade again. To accomplish all of this, Christophe 
instituted mandatory labor, and to strengthen his authority, 
he crowned himself king in 1811. During his reign, he lived in an 
elegant palace called Sans Souci along with his wife and their 
three remaining children. Christophe’s kingdom oversaw rapid 
development of trade, industry, culture, and education. He imported renowned European 
artists to Haiti’s cultural scene, as well as European teachers, in order 
to establish public education. But while the king was initially 
popular among his subjects, his labor mandates were an 
uncomfortable reminder of the slavery Haitians fought to destroy. Over time, his increasingly authoritarian 
policies lost support, and his opponents to the south 
gained strength. In October 1820, his reign finally 
reached its tragic conclusion. Months after a debilitating stroke 
left him unable to govern, key members of his military 
defected to southern forces. Betrayed and despondent, 
the king committed suicide. Today, the traces of Christophe’s 
complicated history can still be found in the crumbling 
remains of his palaces, and in Haiti’s legacy as the first nation 
to permanently abolish slavery.

**Transcript**:
Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is "enough sleep?" And more importantly, can you ever "catch up" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all. If you want to know how to get better quality sleep each night in order to conquer the hurdles of sleep deprivation, we have some tips and research for you over on ASAPThought.

when they’re reunited. Since a light year is exactly the distance
light can travel in a year, Stella’s journey should take 23 years. But from having studied 
special relativity, the twins know it’s not that simple. First of all, the faster an object moves 
through space, the slower it moves through time 
compared to an unmoving observer. This relationship can be quantified with 
something called the Lorentz factor, which is defined by this equation. And secondly, the length of a moving 
object as measured by an observer at rest will contract by the same factor. At 86.6% of the speed of light 
the Lorentz factor is 2, meaning time will pass twice as slowly 
aboard the spaceship. Of course, Stella won’t notice 
time slowing down. That’s because all time-based processes 
in the ship will slow down as well– clocks and electrical devices; Stella’s biological activities including 
her rate of aging and her perception of time itself. The only people who could notice time
on the moving spaceship passing slower for Stella would be observers in an inertial, 
or non-accelerating, reference frame– like Terra back on Earth. Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet
back on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of 
looking at things. Because all movement is relative, Stella argues it would be just as valid to
say her spaceship will stand still while the rest of the universe, 
including Terra, moves around her. And in that case, time will pass twice as 
slowly for Terra, making Stella the older twin in the end. They can’t each be older than the other, 
so which one of them is right? This apparent contradiction is known as
the “Twin Paradox.” But it’s not really a paradox– just an example of how special relativity 
can be easily misunderstood. To test their theories in real-time, each of the twins agrees to send 
a burst of light to the other every time a year has passed for them. Unlike other objects, the speed of light 
is always constant regardless of an observer’s 
reference frame. A light burst sent from Earth will be 
measured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its 
outbound or return trip. So when one twin observes 
a burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the 
other twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light 
to travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, 
and the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will 
simply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent 
to a year as she perceives it. Stella’s path will stretch from the same 
origin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero 
distance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from 
Earth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel 
one light-year, its path will be a 45-degree 
diagonal line. And because Stella is 
traveling away from it, by the time the light catches up to her, over 7 total years will have passed for
Terra, and over 4 for Stella. By the time Stella observes 
Terra’s second burst, she will already be on her return journey. But now, since she’s moving towards the 
source of the light, it will take less time to reach her, and she’ll observe the bursts 
more frequently. This means that Stella observes Terra 
aging slowly for the first half of her journey, but aging rapidly during the return half. Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though 
Terra, the destination star, and the whole universe are 
moving around her. And because of length contraction, Stella observes the distance between 
them shrinking by a factor of 2. This means each leg of the trip will only 
take about six years from Stella’s perspective. When she sends the first signal to Earth, 
two years will have passed for Terra. Stella will send four more light bursts 
during her outbound journey, each one from farther away. By the time Terra observes the first pulse
from Stella's inbound journey, over 21 years will have passed for her. For the rest of Stella's return home, Terra receives multiple light 
bursts each year. Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly 
for about 90% of their 23 years apart, and aging rapidly during the last 10%. This asymmetry accounts for why the 
paradox isn’t really a paradox. Although each twin witnesses time both speeding up and slowing 
down for the other, Stella sees an even split, while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for 
most of the time they’re apart. This is consistent with each twin’s 
measurement of the space voyage, which takes 23 Earth years, but only 
11.5 as experienced aboard the ship. When the twins are reunited, Terra will be
43 years old, while Stella will be 31. Where Stella went wrong was her assumption that she and Terra had
equal claim to being inertial observers. To be an inertial observer, one has to 
maintain a constant speed and direction relative to the rest of the universe. Terra was at rest the entire time, 
so her velocity was a constant zero. But when Stella changed her direction 
for the return journey, she entered a different reference frame 
from the one she’d started in. Terra and Stella now both have a better
understanding of how spacetime works. And as twins who are eleven 
years apart in age, they’re a perfect example 
of special relativity.

measured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its 
outbound or return trip. So when one twin observes 
a burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the 
other twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light 
to travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, 
and the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will 
simply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent 
to a year as she perceives it. Stella’s path will stretch from the same 
origin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero 
distance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from 
Earth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel 
one light-year, its path will be a 45-degree 
diagonal line. And because Stella is 
traveling away from it, by the time the light catches up to her, over 7 total years will have passed for
Terra, and over 4 for Stella. By the time Stella observes 
Terra’s second burst, she will already be on her return journey. But now, since she’s moving towards the 
source of the light, it will take less time to reach her, and she’ll observe the bursts 
more frequently. This means that Stella observes Terra 
aging slowly for the first half of her journey, but aging rapidly during the return half. Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though 
Terra, the destination star, and the whole universe are 
moving around her. And because of length contraction, Stella observes the distance between 
them shrinking by a factor of 2. This means each leg of the trip will only 
take about six years from Stella’s perspective. When she sends the first signal to Earth, 
two years will have passed for Terra. Stella will send four more light bursts 
during her outbound journey, each one from farther away. By the time Terra observes the first pulse
from Stella's inbound journey, over 21 years will have passed for her. For the rest of Stella's return home, Terra receives multiple light 
bursts each year. Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly 
for about 90% of their 23 years apart, and aging rapidly during the last 10%. This asymmetry accounts for why the 
paradox isn’t really a paradox. Although each twin witnesses time both speeding up and slowing 
down for the other, Stella sees an even split, while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for 
most of the time they’re apart. This is consistent with each twin’s 
measurement of the space voyage, which takes 23 Earth years, but only 
11.5 as experienced aboard the ship. When the twins are reunited, Terra will be
43 years old, while Stella will be 31. Where Stella went wrong was her assumption that she and Terra had
equal claim to being inertial observers. To be an inertial observer, one has to 
maintain a constant speed and direction relative to the rest of the universe. Terra was at rest the entire time, 
so her velocity was a constant zero. But when Stella changed her direction 
for the return journey, she entered a different reference frame 
from the one she’d started in. Terra and Stella now both have a better
understanding of how spacetime works. And as twins who are eleven 
years apart in age, they’re a perfect example 
of special relativity.

**Transcript**:
On their 20th birthday, identical twin 
astronauts volunteer for an experiment. Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella 
will board a spaceship. Stella’s ship will travel at 86.6% the 
speed of light to visit a star that is 10 
light-years away, then return to Earth at the same speed. As they prepare to part ways, the twins wonder what will happen 
when they’re reunited. Since a light year is exactly the distance
light can travel in a year, Stella’s journey should take 23 years. But from having studied 
special relativity, the twins know it’s not that simple. First of all, the faster an object moves 
through space, the slower it moves through time 
compared to an unmoving observer. This relationship can be quantified with 
something called the Lorentz factor, which is defined by this equation. And secondly, the length of a moving 
object as measured by an observer at rest will contract by the same factor. At 86.6% of the speed of light 
the Lorentz factor is 2, meaning time will pass twice as slowly 
aboard the spaceship. Of course, Stella won’t notice 
time slowing down. That’s because all time-based processes 
in the ship will slow down as well– clocks and electrical devices; Stella’s biological activities including 
her rate of aging and her perception of time itself. The only people who could notice time
on the moving spaceship passing slower for Stella would be observers in an inertial, 
or non-accelerating, reference frame– like Terra back on Earth. Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet
back on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of 
looking at things. Because all movement is relative, Stella argues it would be just as valid to
say her spaceship will stand still while the rest of the universe, 
including Terra, moves around her. And in that case, time will pass twice as 
slowly for Terra, making Stella the older twin in the end. They can’t each be older than the other, 
so which one of them is right? This apparent contradiction is known as
the “Twin Paradox.” But it’s not really a paradox– just an example of how special relativity 
can be easily misunderstood. To test their theories in real-time, each of the twins agrees to send 
a burst of light to the other every time a year has passed for them. Unlike other objects, the speed of light 
is always constant regardless of an observer’s 
reference frame. A light burst sent from Earth will be 
measured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its 
outbound or return trip. So when one twin observes 
a burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the 
other twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light 
to travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, 
and the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will 
simply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent

origin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero 
distance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from 
Earth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel

**Transcript**:
“A few dozen hours can affect the 
outcome of whole lifetimes/ And that when they do, 
those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains 
of a burned clock… must be resurrected from the ruins 
and examined.” This is the premise of Arundhati Roy’s 
1997 novel "The God of Small Things." Set in a town in Kerala, India called 
Ayemenem, the story revolves around fraternal 
twins Rahel and Estha, who are separated for 23 years 
after the fateful few dozen hours in which their cousin drowns, their 
mother’s illicit affair is revealed, and her lover is murdered. While the book is set at the point of 
Rahel and Estha’s reunion, the narrative takes place mostly in
the past, reconstructing the details around the tragic events that 
led to their separation. Roy’s rich language and masterful 
storytelling earned her the prestigious Booker prize 
for "The God of Small Things." In the novel, she interrogates the culture
of her native India, including its social mores 
and colonial history. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary 
social class that is thousands of years old. By the mid-20th century, the original four castes associated 
with specific occupations had been divided into 
some 3000 sub-castes. Though the caste system was 
Constitutionally abolished in 1950, it continued to shape 
social life in India, routinely marginalizing people 
of lower castes. In the novel, Rahel and Estha have a 
close relationship with Velutha, a worker in their family’s pickle factory and member of the so-called 
“untouchable” caste. When Velutha and the twins’ mother, Ammu,
embark on an affair, they violate what Roy describes as the 
“love laws” forbidding intimacy between 
different castes. Roy warns that the tragic consequences 
of their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” 
like “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.” Roy’s writing makes constant use of these 
ordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most 
tragic moments. The book opens at the funeral of the 
twins’ half-British cousin Sophie after her drowning. As the family mourns, lilies curl and 
crisp in the hot church. A baby bat crawls up a funeral sari. Tears drip from a chin like 
raindrops from a roof. The novel forays into the past to explore
the characters’ struggles to operate in a world 
where they don’t quite fit, alongside their nation’s 
political turmoil. Ammu struggles not to lash out at her 
beloved children when she feels particularly trapped in her
parents’ small-town home, where neighbors judge and shun her 
for being divorced. Velutha, meanwhile, balances his affair
with Ammu and friendship with the twins not only with his employment 
to their family, but also with his membership to a 
budding communist countermovement to Indira Ghandi’s “Green Revolution.” In the 1960s, the misleadingly named 
“Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield 
crops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes 
off their land and caused widespread 
environmental damage. When the twins return to Ayemenem 
as adults, the consequences of the Green Revolution 
are all around them. The river that was bursting with life 
in their childhood greets them “with a ghastly skull’s smile,
with holes where teeth had been, and a limp hand raised 
from a hospital bed.” As Roy probes the depths of human 
experience, she never loses sight of the way her 
characters are shaped by the time and the place where they live. In the world of "The God of Small Things," “Various kinds of despair competed 
for primacy… personal despair could never be 
desperate enough... personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside
shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible 
public turmoil of a nation.”

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
“A few dozen hours can affect the 
outcome of whole lifetimes/ And that when they do, 
those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains 
of a burned clock… must be resurrected from the ruins 
and examined.” This is the premise of Arundhati Roy’s 
1997 novel "The God of Small Things." Set in a town in Kerala, India called 
Ayemenem, the story revolves around fraternal 
twins Rahel and Estha, who are separated for 23 years 
after the fateful few dozen hours in which their cousin drowns, their 
mother’s illicit affair is revealed, and her lover is murdered. While the book is set at the point of 
Rahel and Estha’s reunion, the narrative takes place mostly in
the past, reconstructing the details around the tragic events that 
led to their separation. Roy’s rich language and masterful 
storytelling earned her the prestigious Booker prize 
for "The God of Small Things." In the novel, she interrogates the culture
of her native India, including its social mores 
and colonial history. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary 
social class that is thousands of years old. By the mid-20th century, the original four castes associated 
with specific occupations had been divided into 
some 3000 sub-castes. Though the caste system was 
Constitutionally abolished in 1950, it continued to shape 
social life in India, routinely marginalizing people 
of lower castes. In the novel, Rahel and Estha have a 
close relationship with Velutha, a worker in their family’s pickle factory and member of the so-called 
“untouchable” caste. When Velutha and the twins’ mother, Ammu,
embark on an affair, they violate what Roy describes as the 
“love laws” forbidding intimacy between 
different castes. Roy warns that the tragic consequences 
of their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” 
like “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.” Roy’s writing makes constant use of these 
ordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most 
tragic moments. The book opens at the funeral of the 
twins’ half-British cousin Sophie after her drowning. As the family mourns, lilies curl and 
crisp in the hot church. A baby bat crawls up a funeral sari. Tears drip from a chin like 
raindrops from a roof. The novel forays into the past to explore
the characters’ struggles to operate in a world 
where they don’t quite fit, alongside their nation’s 
political turmoil. Ammu struggles not to lash out at her 
beloved children when she feels particularly trapped in her
parents’ small-town home, where neighbors judge and shun her 
for being divorced. Velutha, meanwhile, balances his affair
with Ammu and friendship with the twins not only with his employment 
to their family, but also with his membership to a 
budding communist countermovement to Indira Ghandi’s “Green Revolution.” In the 1960s, the misleadingly named 
“Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers 
and pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield 
crops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes 
off their land and caused widespread 
environmental damage. When the twins return to Ayemenem 
as adults, the consequences of the Green Revolution 
are all around them. The river that was bursting with life 
in their childhood greets them “with a ghastly skull’s smile,
with holes where teeth had been, and a limp hand raised 
from a hospital bed.” As Roy probes the depths of human 
experience, she never loses sight of the way her 
characters are shaped by the time and the place where they live. In the world of "The God of Small Things," “Various kinds of despair competed 
for primacy… personal despair could never be 
desperate enough... personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside
shrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible 
public turmoil of a nation.”

**Transcript**:
After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being 
battered by waves, Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and 
sage as old as the world itself— washed up on the shores 
of distant Pohjola. Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was 
a dark and frozen land, ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth 
hag of the North." The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen 
back to health but demanded a reward for 
returning him home. Not content with mere gold or silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— 
the Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of white-swan
feathers," “the milk of greatest virtue," “a single grain of barley," and 
“the finest wool of lambskins," this artifact was said to be 
an endless font of wealth. But Väinämöinen knew that 
only Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged 
the sky-dome itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him 
home and fetch the smith. Though the journey was far from easy, 
the bard finally made it back to Kalevala. But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy 
North— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen 
into climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm 
to carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with 
extravagant hospitality and promised him the hand 
of her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When she finally asked if Ilmarinen 
was capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith declared he could 
indeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend 
the forge to his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but 
ill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that 
thirsted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated
fields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds 
themselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he 
pulled the Sampo, with its lid of many colors from 
the forge’s flames. On its sides the smith carefully crafted 
a grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill. Louhi was so delighted with the object’s 
limitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure 
inside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to 
claim his prize, the promised maiden refused to marry him,
and the smith had to return home alone. Years passed, and while 
Pohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without 
wives or great wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard 
proposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and the two sailed north with the 
help of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history 
of starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half 
the Sampo’s profits as compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi summoned 
her forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, 
the bard played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending 
Pohjola into a deep slumber. Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo 
and quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was ecstatic 
at their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing 
of their triumph. The bard refused, knowing the dangers 
of celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling, 
Lemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful singing voice woke 
a nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused 
the Pohjolan horde. The army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen 
raised a rock to breach their hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed 
into a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as they 
attacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo 
in her claw, but just as quickly, it dropped into 
the sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’s reach. Buried on the ocean floor, the remnants of this powerful device 
remain in the realm of Ahti, god of water— where they grind salt for the seas 
to this very day.

wives or great wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard 
proposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and the two sailed north with the 
help of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history 
of starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half 
the Sampo’s profits as compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi summoned 
her forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, 
the bard played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending 
Pohjola into a deep slumber. Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo 
and quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was ecstatic 
at their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing 
of their triumph. The bard refused, knowing the dangers 
of celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling, 
Lemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful singing voice woke 
a nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused 
the Pohjolan horde. The army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen 
raised a rock to breach their hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed 
into a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as they 
attacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo 
in her claw, but just as quickly, it dropped into 
the sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’s reach. Buried on the ocean floor, the remnants of this powerful device 
remain in the realm of Ahti, god of water— where they grind salt for the seas 
to this very day.

**Transcript**:
After a savage seafaring skirmish and eight long days of being 
battered by waves, Väinämöinen— a powerful bard and 
sage as old as the world itself— washed up on the shores 
of distant Pohjola. Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was 
a dark and frozen land, ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth 
hag of the North." The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen 
back to health but demanded a reward for 
returning him home. Not content with mere gold or silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— 
the Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of white-swan
feathers," “the milk of greatest virtue," “a single grain of barley," and 
“the finest wool of lambskins," this artifact was said to be 
an endless font of wealth. But Väinämöinen knew that 
only Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged 
the sky-dome itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him 
home and fetch the smith. Though the journey was far from easy, 
the bard finally made it back to Kalevala. But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy 
North— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen 
into climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm 
to carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with 
extravagant hospitality and promised him the hand 
of her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When she finally asked if Ilmarinen 
was capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith declared he could 
indeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend 
the forge to his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but 
ill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that 
thirsted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated
fields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds 
themselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he 
pulled the Sampo, with its lid of many colors from 
the forge’s flames. On its sides the smith carefully crafted 
a grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill. Louhi was so delighted with the object’s 
limitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure 
inside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to 
claim his prize, the promised maiden refused to marry him,
and the smith had to return home alone. Years passed, and while 
Pohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without

**Transcript**:
When the Hoover Dam was 
completed in 1936, it created a huge source of 
hydroelectric power and zapped a sleepy desert town to life: 
Las Vegas, Nevada. With the power supply from the dam, Las Vegas soon exploded 
with vibrant displays. The source of these dazzling lights was 
electrified neon gas. There are two tricky obstacles 
to making lighted signs out of this naturally clear, 
odorless gas: capturing it and making it glow. French inventor Georges Claude came up 
with techniques to do both. In 1902, he developed a way of liquefying and 
separating specific gases from the air, producing neon on an industrial 
scale for the first time. By 1910, he had come up with a way 
to trap the gas in a glass tube with a special electrode at either end, 
and neon lighting was born. In workshops like Claude's, artisans known as tube-benders 
made neon signs by hand. The tube-benders heated small sections 
of a long, hollow glass tube and quickly bent them into shape. After the glass cooled, they attached 
electrodes to each end and removed the air with a vacuum pump. Then, they passed a high voltage 
current through the tube to remove any impurities on the 
inside of the glass. Finally, they pumped the neon gas in 
and sealed off the electrodes. When a neon sign is turned on, the electric current causes some of 
the neon atoms' electrons to accelerate and break free of their orbits, leaving 
behind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from 
one electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms, 
causing them to ionize as well. When these excited electrons fall back 
to their normal energy levels, their excess energy is carried away 
by photons, or particles of light. All this happens in an instant, and the glow from the photons is what 
we see when we switch on a neon sign. Though it's common to call any 
gas-filled sign a "neon" sign, there are actually 5 different 
gases used in production. Each gas emits photons of a different 
wavelength when electrified, which correspond to different 
colors of light. Neon gives off an orange-red glow, argon 
glows a pale lavender, helium a dusty pink, krypton a silver-
white, and xenon a light purple. These 5 gases can be combined 
with color-coated tubing to create an electrified rainbow of 
text and images. Business owners soon realized how 
effective these colorful beacons were for attracting customers. And unlike a light bulb, a neon sign has 
no incandescent filaments to burn out, and can shine continuously for 40 years 
before the gas depletes. By the 1930s, neon signs were lighting 
up storefronts all over the world. Because of the glass tubes' 
fragile nature, it usually wasn't feasible to ship 
them over long distances. Instead, most neon signs were created by 
local neon shops and then installed nearby. Signs with humor, personality, and 
intricate designs proliferated, no two exactly alike. But by the end of World War II, plastics had become widely 
available and inexpensive, and plastic signs supplanted neon 
as messengers of modernity. Many towns removed neon signs they 
viewed as old-fashioned. Today, neon sign production is only 
a fraction of what it was at its peak, but the craft of tube bending lives 
on relatively unchanged. New creations hand-crafted 
by local artisans join survivors from the heyday of neon, hiding in plain sight in city streets 
around the world.

**Transcript**:
When the Hoover Dam was 
completed in 1936, it created a huge source of 
hydroelectric power and zapped a sleepy desert town to life: 
Las Vegas, Nevada. With the power supply from the dam, Las Vegas soon exploded 
with vibrant displays. The source of these dazzling lights was 
electrified neon gas. There are two tricky obstacles 
to making lighted signs out of this naturally clear, 
odorless gas: capturing it and making it glow. French inventor Georges Claude came up 
with techniques to do both. In 1902, he developed a way of liquefying and 
separating specific gases from the air, producing neon on an industrial 
scale for the first time. By 1910, he had come up with a way 
to trap the gas in a glass tube with a special electrode at either end, 
and neon lighting was born. In workshops like Claude's, artisans known as tube-benders 
made neon signs by hand. The tube-benders heated small sections 
of a long, hollow glass tube and quickly bent them into shape. After the glass cooled, they attached 
electrodes to each end and removed the air with a vacuum pump. Then, they passed a high voltage 
current through the tube to remove any impurities on the 
inside of the glass. Finally, they pumped the neon gas in 
and sealed off the electrodes. When a neon sign is turned on, the electric current causes some of 
the neon atoms' electrons to accelerate and break free of their orbits, leaving 
behind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from 
one electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms, 
causing them to ionize as well. When these excited electrons fall back 
to their normal energy levels, their excess energy is carried away 
by photons, or particles of light. All this happens in an instant, and the glow from the photons is what 
we see when we switch on a neon sign. Though it's common to call any 
gas-filled sign a "neon" sign, there are actually 5 different 
gases used in production. Each gas emits photons of a different 
wavelength when electrified, which correspond to different 
colors of light. Neon gives off an orange-red glow, argon 
glows a pale lavender, helium a dusty pink, krypton a silver-
white, and xenon a light purple. These 5 gases can be combined 
with color-coated tubing to create an electrified rainbow of 
text and images. Business owners soon realized how 
effective these colorful beacons were for attracting customers. And unlike a light bulb, a neon sign has 
no incandescent filaments to burn out, and can shine continuously for 40 years 
before the gas depletes. By the 1930s, neon signs were lighting 
up storefronts all over the world. Because of the glass tubes' 
fragile nature, it usually wasn't feasible to ship 
them over long distances. Instead, most neon signs were created by 
local neon shops and then installed nearby. Signs with humor, personality, and 
intricate designs proliferated, no two exactly alike. But by the end of World War II, plastics had become widely 
available and inexpensive, and plastic signs supplanted neon 
as messengers of modernity. Many towns removed neon signs they 
viewed as old-fashioned. Today, neon sign production is only 
a fraction of what it was at its peak, but the craft of tube bending lives 
on relatively unchanged. New creations hand-crafted 
by local artisans join survivors from the heyday of neon, hiding in plain sight in city streets 
around the world.

**Transcript**:
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe. Little do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation. As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception. You’ve tracked the captors to where 
they’re holding the chef prisoner. From your hiding spot, you can see him 
on the other side of the glass, while in front of you an interrogator 
wearing headphones speaks into a microphone. “We already know the recipe is on the 
13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe deposit box numbered between 
13 and 1300. Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?” You can’t hear the chef’s answer, 
but you can see that he’s lying. The interrogator, however, falls for it. He follows up by asking, 
“Is it a perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer 
but can tell the chef is lying, while the interrogator takes 
him at his word. He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully. The interrogator thinks 
for a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me whether 
or not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.” But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, 
blocking your view. Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the answer and 
is sending agents to retrieve the recipe. You know that the Burger Bazaar people 
have the wrong box number. But can you figure out the right one 
and retrieve the recipe yourself? Pause the video to figure it 
out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The key here is to work backwards. We don’t know what the chef answers 
to the final question or whether he answers truthfully. But we do know that by the time 
the interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options 
down to two numbers– one where the second digit is 1, 
and one where it isn’t. Our goal, then, is to find answers to the 
previous questions that lead to just two possibilities. Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our options the most 
is if the number is a perfect cube. That leaves us with only eight answers 
between 13 and 1300. So let’s assume the answer to the 
third question was a truthful YES. Now, let’s look at the second question. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options
to just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are 
both a square and a cube. But neither of these has a 1 
as the second digit. So the given answer to the second question
must’ve been NO. And that also means we can eliminate these
two squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers. Now for the first question, 
which allows us to divide this list. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being less than 500, we’d have four options, which is too many. But a NO leaves us with two numbers 
greater than 500, one of which does have 
a 1 as its second digit. We don’t know which of these numbers 
the interrogator thinks is correct. But that doesn’t matter– remember, his conclusion 
was based on lies. You, on the other hand, are now in a 
position to reconstruct the truth. First, the chef said the number was 
greater than 500 but lied, meaning it’s actually less than 500. Second, the chef said it wasn’t a 
perfect square but lied again, meaning the number is indeed a square. And finally, he truthfully confirmed 
that it was also a cube. And as we’ve already seen, the only number under 500 that’s 
both a square and a cube is 64. You find the secret recipe and are gone 
before anyone’s the wiser. Corporate espionage is not an easy game— but sometimes, that’s just 
how the sausage is made.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
One of the top chefs from Pasta Palace has been kidnapped by operatives 
from Burger Bazaar hoping to learn the location of their 
secret sauce recipe. Little do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take advantage 
of the situation. As their top spy, your skills range from 
infiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces 
for signs of deception. You’ve tracked the captors to where 
they’re holding the chef prisoner. From your hiding spot, you can see him 
on the other side of the glass, while in front of you an interrogator 
wearing headphones speaks into a microphone. “We already know the recipe is on the 
13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe deposit box numbered between 
13 and 1300. Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?” You can’t hear the chef’s answer, 
but you can see that he’s lying. The interrogator, however, falls for it. He follows up by asking, 
“Is it a perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer 
but can tell the chef is lying, while the interrogator takes 
him at his word. He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully. The interrogator thinks 
for a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me whether 
or not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.” But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, 
blocking your view. Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the answer and 
is sending agents to retrieve the recipe. You know that the Burger Bazaar people 
have the wrong box number. But can you figure out the right one 
and retrieve the recipe yourself? Pause the video to figure it 
out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The key here is to work backwards. We don’t know what the chef answers 
to the final question or whether he answers truthfully. But we do know that by the time 
the interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options 
down to two numbers– one where the second digit is 1, 
and one where it isn’t. Our goal, then, is to find answers to the 
previous questions that lead to just two possibilities. Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our options the most 
is if the number is a perfect cube. That leaves us with only eight answers 
between 13 and 1300. So let’s assume the answer to the 
third question was a truthful YES. Now, let’s look at the second question. If the chef answered YES to the number 
being a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options
to just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are 
both a square and a cube. But neither of these has a 1 
as the second digit. So the given answer to the second question
must’ve been NO. And that also means we can eliminate these
two squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers. Now for the first question, 
which allows us to divide this list. If the chef answered YES to the number

**Transcript**:
"It gets easier, right?" These are the words
I often hear from young parents who are new to the game
of worrying about their children. I tell them that it doesn't. It gets different, but there's always something
to worry about as parents. I remember how I would lie
half-awake at night listening to my son breathe when he was young and had asthma, and then, when he was a teen, until I heard the front door chime open, and I knew that he was home safe. Worrying about our kids
comes with the territory. Now, many of these worries
are about basic issues, like what they eat,
where they are, who they're with. But we also need to keep an eye on
new behaviors and fads. The latest craze is something
that may not yet be on everyone's radar as a serious health concern, and that is the newfound
popularity of vaping, or inhaling sweet aerosols produced by vaporizing
e-liquids in e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, or "vapes,"
as they are commonly called, are flying off the shelves like candy. This year, the e-cigarette
market is expected to drive 26 billion dollars in sales worldwide. Over the next six years, that volume is expected to double. We have a lot of serious concerns
about the health impact of vaping, and unfortunately,
not nearly enough answers. This becomes even more concerning
when you think of who uses e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use, at least in the US, has grown rapidly among youth
and young adults -- our kids, our most vulnerable population. There was a 900 percent growth
in the use of e-cigarettes by youth between 2012 and 2015. The most recent estimates suggest that approximately 3.6 million
high school and middle school students have used e-cigarettes in the US. Now, e-cigarettes were originally created to offer smokers a cleaner
form of nicotine to help with their cigarette addiction. In the US, these devices
come under the FDA's jurisdiction as a tobacco product. But the science on these devices
has not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth, so regulations on the components
of these devices and e-liquids are lagging. Current regulations do restrict
sales of these devices to anyone under the age of 18, but these do not seem
to have had much of an impact on the explosion in the use
of these devices by teens. You know, the first time
I heard of and saw an e-cigarette, I knew right away
that teens would love it. These devices are technology on a stick, a perfect fit for
the smartphone generation -- small, rechargeable, easy to use,
easy to modify, nice smelling -- some even sync with your smartphone
to let you know how much you have vaped. Even I was very drawn
to these very clever devices. And since I had spent a long time
researching teen and adult addictions, I immediately realized that these devices
fit perfectly into the teen psyche. Teens are impulsive,
and they love to try new things. They're also craving independence,
and they love to make things their own. E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly by allowing them the chance
to both innovate and personalize their vape experience. They can choose from over 15,000
different e-liquid flavors and multiple nicotine concentrations. They can even create their own
nicotine flavor combination. They can change how much vapor
is produced from these devices by modifying the puff volume
and the constituents and the power and temperature
of the devices. They can even use these devices
for "cloud chasing." Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks or smoke tricks, involves producing large vape clouds
with quirky shapes and names, like rings, dragons, ghosts ... Cloud chasers can even participate
in cloud competitions and win prizes for creating
the most innovative shaped clouds. Teens can also change the strength
and throat hit from the vapor by either vaporizing the e-liquid
at higher temperatures or dripping the e-liquid
directly onto a heated coil. They can even use these devices
for marijuana vaping. And since the devices
use lower temperatures and do not combust or burn the marijuana, they can do this very discreetly, without the distinctive smell
of burnt marijuana. So they can really make these vape
experiences their own, which may explain the astounding rise
in the use of these devices by youth. E-cigarettes are technically
a very simple device. There is a receptacle for the e-liquid
which can be a tank, a pod or a plug. There is a battery that charges the coil,
which then vaporizes the e-liquid. And then there is a mouthpiece, where the user can actually draw
from the e-cigarette. In 2017, there were 466 e-cigarette
devices in the marketplace. These range from cigarette-like devices
which are also called "cigalikes" to tank systems,
which are also called "pens." And then there are modified devices,
which are also called "mods." Mods look nothing like a cigarette, and they come in various shapes and sizes, with different kinds of attachments
and user adjustments. They're very popular for cloud chasing. The most recent entrance
into the marketplace are the pod devices, which contain the e-liquid in a pod. These are very popular,
by the way, among teens. An example of this is the Juul, which not only looks like a USB device but can also be plugged
into a USB outlet to charge. Many teens do not even think
that these are e-cigarettes, which has led to the use of terms
like "juuling" instead of "vaping." Many of these devices are so discreet
and produce so little vapor that teens are using them in classrooms and hiding them in objects
like Sharpie pens, their clothes, their books. Now, many teens think
that these devices produce water vapor, and therefore, they are safe to use. But this could not be
further from the truth. What is produced is not even a vapor, it's an aerosol, and let me tell you, the difference
is quite pronounced. Aerosols contain many finely suspended
particles of liquids and gases that are created
from whatever is in the e-liquid. So an aerosol could contain
propylene glycol and glycerin, which are solvents in the e-liquid. Now, these solvents are known
to be safe for edible use, so for use in products that you eat, but we know very little about their safety
following long-term inhalational exposure. The e-liquids can also contain alcohol, sometimes in high levels, and inhaling alcohol is known
to have toxic effects on the brain. I told you earlier that the e-liquids
contain over 15,000 different flavors. Here are some examples, some with very catchy but familiar names
like "Skittles" and "Fruit Loops," and others with more exotic names
like "Dragon's Milk" and "Tiger's Blood" and "Unicorn Puke." The e-liquid or the aerosol
can also contain metallic particles like chromium, cadmium and lead. These are generated
from the heating coil in the devices and are also known to have
many toxic effects on vital organs. So no, let me make this very clear: what is produced is definitely
not water vapor. Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine
through e-cigarettes is also very concerning. The teen brain is very sensitive
to even low levels of nicotine and gets very easily addicted. In fact, we have known for a long time that 90 percent of smokers start smoking
cigarettes prior to the age of 18. Those who start early are more addicted
and have a harder time quitting smoking. In other words, and to quote
a past FDA commissioner, "Nicotine addiction ...
is a pediatric disease." E-cigarettes can expose teens
to a lot of nicotine. Many of these devices contain
the amount of nicotine that is in a full pack of cigarettes. The more recent pod devices
contain a nicotine salt, which has a smoother taste
and is much easier to use and can produce rapid increases
in brain nicotine levels. Teens who use e-cigarettes regularly
report symptoms of craving -- feeling anxious when they don't
have their e-cigarettes. All these are hallmarks
of a behavioral addiction. E-cigarettes are not only addictive but they also affect
many other organs in the body. So nicotine, which is
in e-cigarettes, for example, binds to a receptor called
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which plays a key role in the functioning
of almost all organ systems in the human body. And chronic exposure to nicotine
changes the functioning of these systems. So as an example, chronic exposure to nicotine decreases
the flexibility of the blood vessels and changes how the heart responds
to acute challenges like stress. The teen brain is not only sensitive
to the addictive effects of nicotine but also to its toxic effects. In adolescent animals, nicotine
is a very well-established neurotoxin, and it decreases learning,
memory and attention processes and increases hyperactivity symptoms. Teens who use tobacco products
are more likely to use marijuana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety
as a teen or as an adult. So nicotine addiction through e-cigarettes
could be leading them down the path of other addictions
and other mental health problems. Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine
also produces epigenetic changes, or heritable changes in gene expression, for example, in the genes
involved in asthma. So teens who use nicotine may not only
be harming themselves but they could be harming
their future generations. You know, the very existence
of e-cigarettes could have led to an entire generation
of nicotine-addicted youth. Easy access to these devices
could have led to more experimentation with marijuana and many other
vaporizable substances by youth. While there is no doubt that providing
smokers with a cleaner form of nicotine is and should continue
to be a critical goal, we still do not know if these devices
help smokers quit smoking, and we know very little about
the long-term effects of these devices. What we do know is that youth --
lots of youth -- are using these devices. In fact, the FDA commissioner
recently used the term "epidemic" to describe e-cigarette use in the US. While trying to solve one huge
public health problem, cigarette smoking, we may have created another colossal one. Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years
around cigarette smoking led to a cigarette epidemic and many,
many cigarette-related diseases. We do not want to repeat
the same mistakes with e-cigarettes. So now is the time for action, for regulations that address the appeal
and access of these devices to youth. Do smokers really need 15,000
kid-friendly flavors to quit smoking? Do they need so many different
kinds of devices? Is it a good idea to have devices
which are so easy to hide and so easy to use? We recently heard that the FDA plans
to introduce stricter regulations on sales of these devices
that contain e-liquid flavors in retail locations like convenience
stores and gas stations, and also introduce stricter regulations on sales of devices
to minors over the internet. Is this going to be sufficient to change
this rapid increase in youth uptake? We need to ask and answer
such critical questions. Now is also the time for a serious
public education campaign. Teens and their parents need to know that while e-cigarettes may contain
less toxins than cigarettes, they're certainly not benign. Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals
produced by these devices could be changing them in ways
they may not like and setting them up for future
unknown toxicities and health problems. You know, when I said earlier that e-cigarettes were a perfect fit
for the smartphone generation, I was not kidding. We live in a technology-crazed world, where the latest device
and technology gets a lot of attention just because it is technology
and because it is the latest thing. More and more over the next few years
and for the rest of our lives, we are going to see technologies
coming into the marketplace that may not raise
any health flags at first, simply because they don't look unhealthy or they're not a medical device. For example, we could see devices that may make it easier
to go longer without sleep or help us lose weight -- a personal goal of mine -- or achieve any number of other goals that we as consumers
are very, very interested in. But many of these devices may come
with unacceptable risks to our own health. So if we want to protect our health
and the health of our children, perhaps we should get out of the habit of automatically celebrating
such new technology and get into the habit of looking
at them with a critical eye, perhaps even through a medical lens. Because, you know something? Our health, the health of our children
and our future generations is far too valuable
to let it go up in smoke -- or even in aerosol. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
"It gets easier, right?" These are the words
I often hear from young parents who are new to the game
of worrying about their children. I tell them that it doesn't. It gets different, but there's always something
to worry about as parents. I remember how I would lie
half-awake at night listening to my son breathe when he was young and had asthma, and then, when he was a teen, until I heard the front door chime open, and I knew that he was home safe. Worrying about our kids
comes with the territory. Now, many of these worries
are about basic issues, like what they eat,
where they are, who they're with. But we also need to keep an eye on
new behaviors and fads. The latest craze is something
that may not yet be on everyone's radar as a serious health concern, and that is the newfound
popularity of vaping, or inhaling sweet aerosols produced by vaporizing
e-liquids in e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, or "vapes,"
as they are commonly called, are flying off the shelves like candy. This year, the e-cigarette
market is expected to drive 26 billion dollars in sales worldwide. Over the next six years, that volume is expected to double. We have a lot of serious concerns
about the health impact of vaping, and unfortunately,
not nearly enough answers. This becomes even more concerning
when you think of who uses e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use, at least in the US, has grown rapidly among youth
and young adults -- our kids, our most vulnerable population. There was a 900 percent growth
in the use of e-cigarettes by youth between 2012 and 2015. The most recent estimates suggest that approximately 3.6 million
high school and middle school students have used e-cigarettes in the US. Now, e-cigarettes were originally created to offer smokers a cleaner
form of nicotine to help with their cigarette addiction. In the US, these devices
come under the FDA's jurisdiction as a tobacco product. But the science on these devices
has not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth, so regulations on the components
of these devices and e-liquids are lagging. Current regulations do restrict
sales of these devices to anyone under the age of 18, but these do not seem
to have had much of an impact on the explosion in the use
of these devices by teens. You know, the first time
I heard of and saw an e-cigarette, I knew right away
that teens would love it. These devices are technology on a stick, a perfect fit for
the smartphone generation -- small, rechargeable, easy to use,
easy to modify, nice smelling -- some even sync with your smartphone
to let you know how much you have vaped. Even I was very drawn
to these very clever devices. And since I had spent a long time
researching teen and adult addictions, I immediately realized that these devices
fit perfectly into the teen psyche. Teens are impulsive,
and they love to try new things. They're also craving independence,
and they love to make things their own. E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly by allowing them the chance
to both innovate and personalize their vape experience. They can choose from over 15,000
different e-liquid flavors and multiple nicotine concentrations. They can even create their own
nicotine flavor combination. They can change how much vapor
is produced from these devices by modifying the puff volume
and the constituents and the power and temperature
of the devices. They can even use these devices
for "cloud chasing." Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks or smoke tricks, involves producing large vape clouds
with quirky shapes and names, like rings, dragons, ghosts ... Cloud chasers can even participate
in cloud competitions and win prizes for creating
the most innovative shaped clouds. Teens can also change the strength
and throat hit from the vapor by either vaporizing the e-liquid
at higher temperatures or dripping the e-liquid
directly onto a heated coil. They can even use these devices
for marijuana vaping. And since the devices
use lower temperatures and do not combust or burn the marijuana, they can do this very discreetly, without the distinctive smell
of burnt marijuana. So they can really make these vape
experiences their own, which may explain the astounding rise
in the use of these devices by youth. E-cigarettes are technically
a very simple device. There is a receptacle for the e-liquid
which can be a tank, a pod or a plug. There is a battery that charges the coil,
which then vaporizes the e-liquid. And then there is a mouthpiece, where the user can actually draw
from the e-cigarette. In 2017, there were 466 e-cigarette
devices in the marketplace. These range from cigarette-like devices
which are also called "cigalikes" to tank systems,
which are also called "pens." And then there are modified devices,
which are also called "mods." Mods look nothing like a cigarette, and they come in various shapes and sizes, with different kinds of attachments
and user adjustments. They're very popular for cloud chasing. The most recent entrance
into the marketplace are the pod devices, which contain the e-liquid in a pod. These are very popular,
by the way, among teens. An example of this is the Juul, which not only looks like a USB device but can also be plugged
into a USB outlet to charge. Many teens do not even think
that these are e-cigarettes, which has led to the use of terms
like "juuling" instead of "vaping." Many of these devices are so discreet
and produce so little vapor that teens are using them in classrooms and hiding them in objects
like Sharpie pens, their clothes, their books. Now, many teens think
that these devices produce water vapor, and therefore, they are safe to use. But this could not be
further from the truth. What is produced is not even a vapor, it's an aerosol, and let me tell you, the difference
is quite pronounced. Aerosols contain many finely suspended
particles of liquids and gases that are created
from whatever is in the e-liquid. So an aerosol could contain
propylene glycol and glycerin, which are solvents in the e-liquid. Now, these solvents are known
to be safe for edible use, so for use in products that you eat, but we know very little about their safety
following long-term inhalational exposure. The e-liquids can also contain alcohol, sometimes in high levels, and inhaling alcohol is known
to have toxic effects on the brain. I told you earlier that the e-liquids
contain over 15,000 different flavors. Here are some examples, some with very catchy but familiar names
like "Skittles" and "Fruit Loops," and others with more exotic names
like "Dragon's Milk" and "Tiger's Blood" and "Unicorn Puke." The e-liquid or the aerosol
can also contain metallic particles like chromium, cadmium and lead. These are generated
from the heating coil in the devices and are also known to have
many toxic effects on vital organs. So no, let me make this very clear: what is produced is definitely
not water vapor. Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine

**Transcript**:
The attacking infantry advances steadily, their elephants already having 
broken the defensive line. The king tries to retreat, but enemy 
cavalry flanks him from the rear. Escape is impossible. But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game. Over the roughly one-and-a-half millennia 
of its existence, chess has been known as a tool 
of military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, 
and a benchmark of genius. While our earliest records of chess 
are in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins 
lie a century earlier. Supposedly, when the youngest prince 
of the Gupta Empire was killed in battle, his brother devised a way of representing
the scene to their grieving mother. Set on the 8x8 ashtapada board used for
other popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two key features: different rules for moving 
different types of pieces, and a single king piece whose fate 
determined the outcome. The game was originally 
known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions." But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name 
and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning 
king, and “checkmate” from "shah mat," or “the king is helpless.” After the 7th century Islamic conquest 
of Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Transcending its role as a 
tactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source 
of poetic imagery. Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms 
to describe political power. Ruling caliphs became avid 
players themselves. And historian al-Mas’udi considered the 
game a testament to human free will compared to games of chance. Medieval trade along the Silk Road carried
the game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local variants developed. In China, chess pieces were placed at 
intersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native 
strategy game Go. The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw 
an 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces 
could be used by the opposing player. But it was in Europe that chess began to 
take on its modern form. By 1000 AD, the game had become part 
of courtly education. Chess was used as an allegory for different social classes performing 
their proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted 
in their new context. At the same time, the Church remained 
suspicious of games. Moralists cautioned against devoting 
too much time to them, with chess even being briefly 
banned in France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into
the form we know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was 
recast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge 
of strong female leaders. This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings 
and endgames appeared. Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game 
moved from royal courts to coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression 
of creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays. This "Romantic" style reached its peak 
in the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen 
and both rooks. But the emergence of formal competitive 
play in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would 
eventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international 
competition, chess took on a new 
geopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources
to cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest 
of the century. But the player who would truly upset 
Russian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing computers had been 
developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph 
over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine 
had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of 
consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products 
of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide
us out of this apparent checkmate.

other popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two key features: different rules for moving 
different types of pieces, and a single king piece whose fate 
determined the outcome. The game was originally 
known as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for "four divisions." But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name 
and terminology– "chess," derived from "shah," meaning 
king, and “checkmate” from "shah mat," or “the king is helpless.” After the 7th century Islamic conquest 
of Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Transcending its role as a 
tactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source

to describe political power. Ruling caliphs became avid

intersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native 
strategy game Go. The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw 
an 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces 
could be used by the opposing player. But it was in Europe that chess began to

their proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted

suspicious of games. Moralists cautioned against devoting 
too much time to them, with chess even being briefly 
banned in France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into
the form we know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was 
recast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge 
of strong female leaders. This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings 
and endgames appeared. Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game 
moved from royal courts to coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression 
of creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays. This "Romantic" style reached its peak 
in the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen 
and both rooks. But the emergence of formal competitive 
play in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would 
eventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international 
competition, chess took on a new 
geopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources
to cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest 
of the century. But the player who would truly upset 
Russian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing computers had been 
developed for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph 
over Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine 
had defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of 
consistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products 
of human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide

Note: Since the generated question does not match the ground truth question, the scores are low. A better-generated question would be one that aligns with the content and intent of the ground truth question. 

However, I must point out that there isn't a perfect match for the given ground truth MCQ in the provided transcript. The transcript does mention the evolution of chess pieces, including the advisor being recast as the more powerful queen, but it does not specifically mention the cleft shape of the bishop's mitre or its original representation. 

If I were to create a generated MCQ that matches the given ground truth MCQ, I would need more information or context about the bishop's mitre and its significance in the game of chess. 

Here's an example of a generated MCQ that could potentially match the given ground truth MCQ:

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the origin of the distinctive shape of the bishop's mitre in chess?
Options: A. It represents a peasant's pitchfork, B. It represents an elephant's tusks, C. It represents a horse's hoof
Correct Option: B

This generated MCQ aligns with the content and intent of the ground truth question and provides plausible distractors. However, without more context or information, it's difficult to create a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a countdown. On August 14th, 1947, a woman in Bombay goes into labor 
as the clock ticks towards midnight. Across India, people hold their breath 
for the declaration of independence after nearly two centuries of British 
occupation and rule. And at the stroke of midnight, a squirming infant and two new 
nations are born in perfect synchronicity. These events form the foundation 
of "Midnight’s Children," a dazzling novel by the British-Indian 
author Salman Rushdie. The baby who is the exact same age 
as the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over 
30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time 
to speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: 
Saleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related 
to the time of his birth. And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around 
the stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, 
a spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, 
a gifted warrior. With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a 
vast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step 
through time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender 
when immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins. Saleem acts as a delightful guide 
to magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day 
of celebration, it also marks a turbulent period 
in Indian history. In 1948, the leader of the Indian 
independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided 
with Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India 
and Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of 
the Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment 
of Bangladesh in 1971 and the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi. This vast historical frame is one 
reason why "Midnight’s Children" is considered one of the most illuminating
works of postcolonial literature ever written. This genre typically addresses the 
experience of people living in colonized and formerly colonized countries, and explores the fallout through themes 
like revolution, migration, and identity. Rushdie, who like Saleem was born in 1947,
was educated in India and Britain, and is renowned for his cross-continental 
histories, political commentary, and magical realism. He enriches "Midnight’s Children" 
with a plethora of Indian and Pakistani cultural references, from family traditions to food, 
religion and folktales. Scribbling by night under the 
watchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes 
that of "1001 Nights," where a woman named Scheherazade 
tells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, 
of alternative realities.” Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with 
multiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading 
a rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in-
the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens 
after I’ve gone which would not have happened 
if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional 
in this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six-
hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, 
you’ll have to swallow a world.” Saleem’s narrative often has 
a breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the 
cosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever 
condense history into a single narrative. His mind-bending plot and 
shapeshifting characters have garnered continuing 
fascination and praise. Not only did "Midnight’s Children" win 
the prestigious Man Booker Prize in its year of publication, but in a 2008 competition that pitted 
all 39 winners against each other, it was named the best of all the winners. In a masterpiece of epic proportions, Rushdie reveals that there 
are no singular truths— rather, it’s wiser to believe in several 
versions of reality at once, hold many lives in the 
palms of our hands, and experience multiple moments 
in a single stroke of the clock.

**Transcript**:
It begins with a countdown. On August 14th, 1947, a woman in Bombay goes into labor 
as the clock ticks towards midnight. Across India, people hold their breath 
for the declaration of independence after nearly two centuries of British 
occupation and rule. And at the stroke of midnight, a squirming infant and two new 
nations are born in perfect synchronicity. These events form the foundation 
of "Midnight’s Children," a dazzling novel by the British-Indian 
author Salman Rushdie. The baby who is the exact same age 
as the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over 
30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time 
to speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: 
Saleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related 
to the time of his birth. And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around 
the stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, 
a spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, 
a gifted warrior. With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a 
vast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step 
through time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender 
when immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins. Saleem acts as a delightful guide 
to magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day 
of celebration, it also marks a turbulent period 
in Indian history. In 1948, the leader of the Indian 
independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided 
with Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India 
and Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of 
the Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment

watchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes 
that of "1001 Nights," where a woman named Scheherazade 
tells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, 
of alternative realities.” Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with 
multiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading 
a rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in-
the-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens 
after I’ve gone which would not have happened 
if I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional 
in this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six-
hundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, 
you’ll have to swallow a world.” Saleem’s narrative often has 
a breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the 
cosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever 
condense history into a single narrative. His mind-bending plot and 
shapeshifting characters have garnered continuing 
fascination and praise. Not only did "Midnight’s Children" win 
the prestigious Man Booker Prize in its year of publication, but in a 2008 competition that pitted 
all 39 winners against each other, it was named the best of all the winners. In a masterpiece of epic proportions, Rushdie reveals that there 
are no singular truths— rather, it’s wiser to believe in several 
versions of reality at once, hold many lives in the 
palms of our hands, and experience multiple moments 
in a single stroke of the clock.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider the spot where you’re sitting. Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at 
the bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, 
infernal landscape. But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous 
cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the 
biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies. Seemingly empty regions 
of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain 
threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster 
and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn 
hydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow 
off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas 
and dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, 
and send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments,
bits of rock, and, further out, ices. We’ve observed thousands of these disks 
in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together
into larger and larger masses. Dust grains 100 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called 
the van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons 
shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, 
and a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can 
only hold tiny things together. And there’s a problem: once dust 
clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should 
constantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow
is the first mystery of dust bunnies. One theory looks to electrostatic charge 
to answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, 
and UV photons knock electrons off of gas 
atoms within the disk, creating positive ions 
and negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes 
clusters together, like repels like 
and slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions 
they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, 
they’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy 
particles can knock more electrons off of some 
dust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, 
and clusters grow rapidly. But before long we reach 
another set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies 
eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid 
pellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how 
or why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form,
how do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before 
are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together 
by gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the 
mass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape 
an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated 
by your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the 
outside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded
by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust. Eventually the chondrule pellets get 
cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold 
themselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow 
into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today. Ultimately, the seeds of 
everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position 
within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large 
series of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t 
have been right for the formation of life on our planet.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider the spot where you’re sitting. Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at 
the bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, 
infernal landscape. But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous 
cloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the 
biggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies. Seemingly empty regions 
of space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain 
threshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster 
and faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn 
hydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow 
off the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas 
and dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, 
and send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments,
bits of rock, and, further out, ices. We’ve observed thousands of these disks 
in the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together
into larger and larger masses. Dust grains 100 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called 
the van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons 
shifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, 
and a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can 
only hold tiny things together. And there’s a problem: once dust 
clusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should 
constantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow
is the first mystery of dust bunnies. One theory looks to electrostatic charge 
to answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, 
and UV photons knock electrons off of gas 
atoms within the disk, creating positive ions 
and negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes 
clusters together, like repels like 
and slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions 
they won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, 
they’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy 
particles can knock more electrons off of some 
dust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, 
and clusters grow rapidly. But before long we reach 
another set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies 
eventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid 
pellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how 
or why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form,
how do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before 
are too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together 
by gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the 
mass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape 
an asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated 
by your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the 
outside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded
by a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust. Eventually the chondrule pellets get 
cemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold 
themselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow 
into larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today. Ultimately, the seeds of 
everything familiar– the size of our planet, its position 
within the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large 
series of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t 
have been right for the formation of life on our planet.

**Transcript**:
Hercules, 
the strongest man alive with a mighty heart to match. Orpheus, 
charmer of nature and master of music. Castor and Pollux, 
the twin tricksters hatched from an egg. The Boreads, 
sons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air. For untold times 
these heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went. But none of their adventures 
was so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason. Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias 
had ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly 
from Jason’s grandfather. When Jason returned 
to his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king 
set him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal 
the golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose. If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne. Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon 
he had assembled a not-so-motley crew. These heroes, alongside countless sailors,
soothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves 
the Argonauts after their sturdy ship. But the path ahead 
was marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes. Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women 
who had killed all the island’s men. As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them
with a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason 
fathering twins with the queen. The rest of the crew also found themselves
embroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them 
for not behaving like heroes. Eventually, 
they sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, 
six-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed 
the Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down 
from the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray. Bolstered by their victory, 
the triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back 
to the island several stormy nights later. In the tempest, the Doliones 
thought these new arrivals invaders. The Argonauts were similarly unaware 
of their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, 
slaying wave after wave of foe. But the morning light 
revealed a horrible truth: their victims 
were none other than their previous hosts. Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew 
to be distracted, this time at a terrible cost. Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved 
to focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous. When Hercules’ squire 
was abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence 
of his most powerful crewmate. The remaining Argonauts 
continued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man 
surrounded by a swirl of harpies. This was Phineas, 
a seer cursed by Zeus to endure 
old age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away 
his prophecies. Moved by his plight, 
the wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas 
with a brief respite from his punishment. In return, the seer told them how to overcome
the terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks 
that reduced ships to splinters. But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver 
past the mouth of hell, around the island 
of the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies. These adventures cost the crew 
both in men and morale– and some feared 
they might be losing their minds. Upon reaching the clashing rocks, 
the exhausted crew quaked with fear. But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads. The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake 
to emerge unscathed. With this narrow escape, the Argonauts 
finally had Colchis in their sights. Yet while Jason rested 
and celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time 
among them was drawing to a close. As the fleece gleamed in his mind, he knew 
he would have to retrieve it alone. But he could not guess 
that this final task would have the most horrible price of all.

**Transcript**:
Hercules, 
the strongest man alive with a mighty heart to match. Orpheus, 
charmer of nature and master of music. Castor and Pollux, 
the twin tricksters hatched from an egg. The Boreads, 
sons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air. For untold times 
these heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went. But none of their adventures 
was so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason. Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias 
had ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly 
from Jason’s grandfather. When Jason returned 
to his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king 
set him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal 
the golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose. If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne. Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon 
he had assembled a not-so-motley crew. These heroes, alongside countless sailors,
soothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves 
the Argonauts after their sturdy ship. But the path ahead 
was marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes. Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women 
who had killed all the island’s men. As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them
with a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason 
fathering twins with the queen. The rest of the crew also found themselves
embroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them 
for not behaving like heroes. Eventually, 
they sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, 
six-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed 
the Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down 
from the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray. Bolstered by their victory, 
the triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back 
to the island several stormy nights later. In the tempest, the Doliones 
thought these new arrivals invaders. The Argonauts were similarly unaware 
of their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, 
slaying wave after wave of foe. But the morning light 
revealed a horrible truth: their victims 
were none other than their previous hosts. Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew 
to be distracted, this time at a terrible cost. Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved 
to focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous. When Hercules’ squire 
was abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence 
of his most powerful crewmate. The remaining Argonauts 
continued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man 
surrounded by a swirl of harpies. This was Phineas, 
a seer cursed by Zeus to endure 
old age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away 
his prophecies. Moved by his plight, 
the wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas 
with a brief respite from his punishment. In return, the seer told them how to overcome
the terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks 
that reduced ships to splinters. But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver 
past the mouth of hell, around the island 
of the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies. These adventures cost the crew 
both in men and morale– and some feared 
they might be losing their minds. Upon reaching the clashing rocks, 
the exhausted crew quaked with fear. But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads. The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake 
to emerge unscathed. With this narrow escape, the Argonauts 
finally had Colchis in their sights. Yet while Jason rested 
and celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time 
among them was drawing to a close. As the fleece gleamed in his mind, he knew 
he would have to retrieve it alone. But he could not guess 
that this final task would have the most horrible price of all.

**Transcript**:
Despite a serene sunset 
on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks. The year is 1676, and the Treaty of 
Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
and the Ottoman Empire. But as Stepan and his men ride 
towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds. Having made their home in the Wild Fields 
north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic 
word for "free man"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most 
formidable military forces. Composed of hunters, fishermen, 
nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these 
fertile unclaimed lands. Yet this freedom has proven increasingly 
difficult to maintain. Their decades-long strategy of shifting 
alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning 
of their lands. In a desperate bid to reclaim independence
and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro 
Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire. This alliance successfully freed the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but 
their victory was a bitter one. Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies 
ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery. And outrage at allying with Muslims 
against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support. Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing 
on what their next move should be. Until then, Stepan must keep order. With his musket and curved saber, 
he cuts an imposing figure. He surveys his battalion of 180 men. Most are Orthodox Christians 
and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian. But there are also Greeks, Tatars, 
and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions 
on recent events. Officially, all of Stepan’s men have 
sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military 
training and remaining unmarried. In practice, some are part-timers, holding
more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby 
villages, outside Cossack lands. Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not 
broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life. Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with 
the tide of military action. The settlement is remarkably well-
organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, 
as Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way 
to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other 
battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several 
hundred man regiment. Inside, the men dine on dried fish, 
sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine. Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to 
lighten the mood with his bandura. But before long, an argument 
has broken out. One of his men has raised 
a toast to Doroshenko. Stepan cuts him off. The room is silent until he raises 
his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance 
with Moscow against the Turks. Stepan plans to support him, and 
he expects his men to do the same. Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, 
or general council meeting. Stepan and the others make their 
way towards the church square— the center of Sich life. Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused 
crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman 
camp completely vulnerable on one side. Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will 
ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, 
and bring unity to the Wild Fields. As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed 
sense of brotherhood. Over the next 200 years, these 
freedom fighters would take on many foes. And tragically, they would eventually become the 
oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed. But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of 
independence and defiance. As the Russian painter 
Ilya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, 
equality, and fraternity so deeply.”

as Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way 
to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other 
battalions or kurins, all of which make up a several 
hundred man regiment. Inside, the men dine on dried fish, 
sheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine. Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to 
lighten the mood with his bandura. But before long, an argument 
has broken out. One of his men has raised 
a toast to Doroshenko. Stepan cuts him off. The room is silent until he raises 
his own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance 
with Moscow against the Turks. Stepan plans to support him, and 
he expects his men to do the same. Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, 
or general council meeting. Stepan and the others make their 
way towards the church square— the center of Sich life. Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused 
crowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman 
camp completely vulnerable on one side. Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will 
ride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, 
and bring unity to the Wild Fields. As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed 
sense of brotherhood. Over the next 200 years, these 
freedom fighters would take on many foes. And tragically, they would eventually become the 
oppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed. But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of 
independence and defiance. As the Russian painter 
Ilya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, 
equality, and fraternity so deeply.”

**Transcript**:
Despite a serene sunset 
on the Dnipro river, the mood is tense for the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks. The year is 1676, and the Treaty of 
Żurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
and the Ottoman Empire. But as Stepan and his men ride 
towards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds. Having made their home in the Wild Fields 
north of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic 
word for "free man"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most 
formidable military forces. Composed of hunters, fishermen, 
nomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these 
fertile unclaimed lands. Yet this freedom has proven increasingly 
difficult to maintain. Their decades-long strategy of shifting 
alliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning 
of their lands. In a desperate bid to reclaim independence
and reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro 
Doroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire. This alliance successfully freed the 
Zaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but 
their victory was a bitter one. Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies 
ravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery. And outrage at allying with Muslims 
against fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support. Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing 
on what their next move should be. Until then, Stepan must keep order. With his musket and curved saber, 
he cuts an imposing figure. He surveys his battalion of 180 men. Most are Orthodox Christians 
and speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian. But there are also Greeks, Tatars, 
and even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions 
on recent events. Officially, all of Stepan’s men have 
sworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military 
training and remaining unmarried. In practice, some are part-timers, holding
more closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby 
villages, outside Cossack lands. Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not 
broken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life. Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with 
the tide of military action. The settlement is remarkably well-
organized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, 
as Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way 
to the barracks where they live and train alongside several other

**Transcript**:
“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm
that keeps changing directions. You change direction 
but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance 
with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something 
that blew in from far away… This storm is you.
Something inside of you.” This quote, from the first chapter 
of Haruki Murakami’s "Kafka on the Shore," captures the teenage protagonist's 
turmoil. Desperate to escape his tyrannical father and the family curse 
he feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka 
after his favorite author and runs away from home. But memories of a missing mother, along with dreams 
that haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun. Published in Japanese in 2002 and translated into English 
three years later, "Kafka on the Shore" 
is an epic literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories,
and magical underworlds. Readers delight in discovering 
how the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters 
and eerie coincidences fit together. Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest centering on an old man 
named Satoru Nakata. After awakening from a coma 
he went into during the Second World War, Nakata loses 
the ability to read and write– but gains a mysterious knack 
for talking to cats. When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown onto a dangerous path 
that runs parallel to Kafka’s. Soon prophecies come true, 
portals to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches 
begin raining from the sky. But what ties these two characters 
together– and is it a force 
either one of them can control? The collision of different worlds
is a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work. His novels and short stories 
often forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, 
and Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up 
during the post-World War II American occupation of Japan. The shadow of war 
hung over his life as it does his fiction; "Kafka on the Shore" 
features biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws 
from multiple cultural traditions. References to Western society 
and Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion 
to food and ghost stories. He has a penchant 
for musical references, too, especially in "Kafka on the Shore." As the runaway Kafka 
wanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge 
in an exquisite private library. While he spends his days 
poring over old books and contemplating a strange painting 
and the library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him 
to classical music like Schubert. This musical sensibility 
makes Murakami’s work all the more hypnotic. He frequently bends the line 
between reality and a world of dreams, and is considered a master 
of magic lurking in the mundane. This is a key feature of magical realism. In contrast to fantasy, magic in this sort of writing 
rarely offers a way out of a problem. Instead, it becomes just one more thing
that complicates life. In "Kafka on the Shore," characters are faced with 
endless otherworldly distractions, from a love sick ghost 
to a flute made from cat souls. These challenges offer no easy answers. Instead, they leave us 
marveling at the resourcefulness of the human spirit 
to deal with the unexpected. While Kafka 
often seems suspended in strangeness, there’s a tenderness and integrity 
at the heart of his mission that keeps him moving forward. Gradually he comes 
to accept his inner confusion. In the end, 
his experience echoes the reader’s: the deeper you go, the more you find.

**Transcript**:
“Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm
that keeps changing directions. You change direction 
but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance 
with death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something 
that blew in from far away… This storm is you.
Something inside of you.” This quote, from the first chapter 
of Haruki Murakami’s "Kafka on the Shore," captures the teenage protagonist's 
turmoil. Desperate to escape his tyrannical father and the family curse 
he feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka 
after his favorite author and runs away from home. But memories of a missing mother, along with dreams 
that haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun. Published in Japanese in 2002 and translated into English 
three years later, "Kafka on the Shore" 
is an epic literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories,
and magical underworlds. Readers delight in discovering 
how the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters 
and eerie coincidences fit together. Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest centering on an old man 
named Satoru Nakata. After awakening from a coma 
he went into during the Second World War, Nakata loses 
the ability to read and write– but gains a mysterious knack 
for talking to cats. When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown onto a dangerous path 
that runs parallel to Kafka’s. Soon prophecies come true, 
portals to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches 
begin raining from the sky. But what ties these two characters 
together– and is it a force 
either one of them can control? The collision of different worlds
is a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work. His novels and short stories 
often forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, 
and Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up 
during the post-World War II American occupation of Japan. The shadow of war 
hung over his life as it does his fiction; "Kafka on the Shore" 
features biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws 
from multiple cultural traditions. References to Western society 
and Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion 
to food and ghost stories. He has a penchant 
for musical references, too, especially in "Kafka on the Shore." As the runaway Kafka 
wanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge 
in an exquisite private library. While he spends his days 
poring over old books and contemplating a strange painting 
and the library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him 
to classical music like Schubert. This musical sensibility 
makes Murakami’s work all the more hypnotic. He frequently bends the line 
between reality and a world of dreams, and is considered a master 
of magic lurking in the mundane. This is a key feature of magical realism. In contrast to fantasy, magic in this sort of writing 
rarely offers a way out of a problem. Instead, it becomes just one more thing
that complicates life. In "Kafka on the Shore," characters are faced with 
endless otherworldly distractions, from a love sick ghost 
to a flute made from cat souls. These challenges offer no easy answers. Instead, they leave us 
marveling at the resourcefulness of the human spirit 
to deal with the unexpected. While Kafka 
often seems suspended in strangeness, there’s a tenderness and integrity 
at the heart of his mission that keeps him moving forward. Gradually he comes 
to accept his inner confusion. In the end, 
his experience echoes the reader’s: the deeper you go, the more you find.

[Music] where do you go to quench your thirst the kitchen sink the local bar the mineral-rich springs of bergamo italy in the 21st century you don't have to go that far for fresh water but still supply is running out what if we didn't have to worry about water consumption what if you could drink and shower as much as you wanted what if a trip to the well and a trip to the beach we're one in the same you might give a lot for those privileges but how much would it really cost this is what if and here's what would happen if all sea water became freshwater the first big question we have to ask is why is the ocean so salty to begin with well it wasn't always like that about 3.8 billion years ago Earth's surface had finally cooled to the point that water vapour turned to liquid no salt added that's right a really really long time ago the oceans were freshwater but that wasn't going to last whenever it rains carbon dioxide from the air dissolves into the falling water this makes the rain slightly acidic and when it falls it causes rocks to erode from there rainwater slides towards nearby rivers and streams taking loose salt and minerals along with it from there this runoff flows from rivers into the ocean add to that any additional salt and minerals that would be expelled from hydrothermal vents or submarine volcanoes and then consider that this whole process has been recurring more or less consistently for 3.8 billion years that's a lot of salt in fact there's so much salt in the ocean that if you spread it evenly across all the land on earth it would amount to one towering layer of salt that's 40 stories tall 97% of all the water on Earth is saline and we've got to assume it's for a reason so what would our world look like if we took the salt out of the sea fresh water oceans sure do sound like a godsend right now it's predicted that a third of the world will be facing chronic water shortages by 2025 at our current rate of consumption the global demand for fresh water doubles every 20 years so maybe fresh water oceans would actually yield a good outcome this time nope a sea without salt would decimate marine life and dramatically affect our weather and temperatures making human life on Earth very difficult if not impossible there are roughly two hundred and twenty eight thousand four hundred and fifty species in the ocean and as many as two million more to be discovered but if the ocean were to become desalinated we'd never find them saltwater fish and other ocean creatures evolved to be able to drink salt water to stay hydrated and get rid of excess salt not all sea creatures do this the same way but being able to pump out excess salt is crucial to surviving in the ocean some species like salmon have adapted to tolerate freshwater and saltwater but for the most part all saltwater species would perish this includes underwater algae which believe it or not accounts for half the photosynthesis that occurs on earth photosynthesis plays a vital role in supplying our planet with oxygen since trees and plants convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the air we breathe so without algae not only do we get less oxygen we also have a lot more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere this intensification of the greenhouse effect would make some parts of the world unbearably hot you definitely notice this intense heat near the equator since our ocean currents wouldn't be circulating warm water and air the way they used to convection currents help warm water from the equator get farther north while colder water from the north is able to cool hotter areas down south at the equator warmer water can carry more salt so this denser water sinks lower while cooler water flows over top of it and in the far north the water gets cold enough to freeze and form sea ice salt gets left behind as the water freezes and naturally this makes colder water up north denser allowing it to sink to the bottom to make room for the incoming warmer water that's worked its way up from the south but without salt the whole process breaks down Earth's extremities would freeze while weather around the equator would intensify for one thing hurricanes would be a lot more frequent and a lot more deadly at this point our weather and our climate would be totally different from how we know it now how long would we survive to see all these changes not long at all you'd either freeze over heat die in a natural disaster or starve to death yeah with significantly less photosynthesis and climates that are either extremely cold or extremely hot our weather would no longer support the diverse plant life that has now the entire food chain would collapse most species would die off including humans since crops we rely on for sustenance would all disappear so when we say ocean salinization is important don't take it with a grain of salt of course we respect the scientific method so keep questioning the world and its properties on land and beyond and come back soon for another what-if [Music]

rid of excess salt not all sea creatures do this the same way but being able to pump out excess salt is crucial to surviving in the ocean some species like salmon have adapted to tolerate freshwater and saltwater but for the most part all saltwater species would perish this includes underwater algae which believe it or not accounts for half the photosynthesis that occurs on earth photosynthesis plays a vital role in supplying our planet with oxygen since trees and plants convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the air we breathe so without algae not only do we get less oxygen we also have a lot more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere this intensification of the greenhouse effect would make some parts of the world unbearably hot you definitely notice this intense heat near the equator since our ocean currents wouldn't be circulating warm water and air the way they used to convection currents help warm water from the equator get farther north while colder water from the north is able to cool hotter areas down south at the equator warmer water can carry more salt so this denser water sinks lower while cooler water flows over top of it and in the far north the water gets cold enough to freeze and form sea ice salt gets left behind as the water freezes and naturally this makes colder water up north denser allowing it to sink to the bottom to make room for the incoming warmer water that's worked its way up from the south but without salt the whole process breaks down Earth's extremities would freeze while weather around the equator would intensify for one thing hurricanes would be a lot more frequent and a lot more deadly at this point our weather and our climate would be totally different from how we know it now how long would we survive to see all these changes not long at all you'd either freeze over heat die in a natural disaster or starve to death yeah with significantly less photosynthesis and climates that are either extremely cold or extremely hot our weather would no longer support the diverse plant life that has now the entire food chain would collapse most species would die off including humans since crops we rely on for sustenance would all disappear so when we say ocean salinization is important don't take it with a grain of salt of course we respect the scientific method so keep questioning the world and its properties on land and beyond and come back soon for another what-if [Music]

**Transcript**:
The contents of this metal cylinder could
either revolutionize technology or be completely useless— it all depends on whether we can harness
the strange physics of matter at very, very small scales. To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment 
precisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against
vibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening
or closing doors. The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air. Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, 
reachable by tiny laser beams. Inside are ultra-sensitive particles
that make up a quantum computer. So what makes these particles 
worth the effort? In theory, quantum computers could 
outstrip the computational limits of classical computers. Classical computers process 
data in the form of bits. Each bit can switch between two states 
labeled zero and one. A quantum computer uses something 
called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, 
and what’s called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information 
than one or zero. You can think of these positions as 
points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere 
represent one and zero. A bit can only switch between 
these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere. We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves 
into a zero or a one. But even though we can’t observe the 
qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform 
particular operations while in this state. So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly
more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will 
theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a
classical computer would need bits. The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic 
and subatomic particles. These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the 
state of the qubit. Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature 
and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles. That’s why quantum computers need 
such an elaborate set up. It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers 
remains largely theoretical. So far, we can only control a few qubits 
in the same place at the same time. There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum 
states effectively: the types of particles a quantum 
computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles. For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits. A trapped ion quantum computer uses 
ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The ions are housed in a trap made 
of electrical fields. Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what 
operation to make by causing the qubit state 
to rotate on the sphere. To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15? In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether
the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. An imaging system collects these photons
and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5. Superconducting qubit quantum computers
do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits 
instead of an ion trap. The states of each electrical circuit 
translate to the state of the qubit. They can be manipulated with electrical
inputs in the form of microwaves. So: the qubits come from either ions 
or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves. Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages. Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
control each with precision. We can’t currently contain enough ions 
in a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to 
connect many smaller traps that communicate with each 
other via photons rather than trying to create one big trap. Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make
operations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number 
of circuits in a computer than the number of ions. But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan. And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the 
environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states. But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making 
computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.

of circuits in a computer than the number of ions. But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan. And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the 
environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states. But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making 
computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The contents of this metal cylinder could
either revolutionize technology or be completely useless— it all depends on whether we can harness
the strange physics of matter at very, very small scales. To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment 
precisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against
vibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening
or closing doors. The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air. Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, 
reachable by tiny laser beams. Inside are ultra-sensitive particles
that make up a quantum computer. So what makes these particles 
worth the effort? In theory, quantum computers could 
outstrip the computational limits of classical computers. Classical computers process 
data in the form of bits. Each bit can switch between two states 
labeled zero and one. A quantum computer uses something 
called a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, 
and what’s called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information 
than one or zero. You can think of these positions as 
points on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere 
represent one and zero. A bit can only switch between 
these two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere. We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves 
into a zero or a one. But even though we can’t observe the 
qubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform 
particular operations while in this state. So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly
more bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will 
theoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a
classical computer would need bits. The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic 
and subatomic particles. These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the 
state of the qubit. Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature 
and pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles. That’s why quantum computers need 
such an elaborate set up. It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers 
remains largely theoretical. So far, we can only control a few qubits 
in the same place at the same time. There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum 
states effectively: the types of particles a quantum 
computer uses, and how it manipulates those particles. For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits. A trapped ion quantum computer uses 
ions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The ions are housed in a trap made 
of electrical fields. Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what 
operation to make by causing the qubit state 
to rotate on the sphere. To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15? In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether
the ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. An imaging system collects these photons
and processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5. Superconducting qubit quantum computers
do the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits 
instead of an ion trap. The states of each electrical circuit 
translate to the state of the qubit. They can be manipulated with electrical
inputs in the form of microwaves. So: the qubits come from either ions 
or electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves. Each approach has advantages 
and disadvantages. Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to 
control each with precision. We can’t currently contain enough ions 
in a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to 
connect many smaller traps that communicate with each 
other via photons rather than trying to create one big trap. Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make
operations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number 
of circuits in a computer than the number of ions. But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan. And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the 
environmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states. But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making 
computations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe.
