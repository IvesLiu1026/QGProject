**Transcript**:
Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people
who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution. The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries. Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries. They are commonly referred to as refugees. But what exactly does that term mean? The world has known refugees 
for millennia, but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War. It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality, and is unable to return 
to their home country because of well-founded fears
of being persecuted. That persecution may be due to their race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion, and is often related to war and violence. Today, roughly half the world's refugees
are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation. Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes. But before we get 
to what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up. There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee." "Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution, such as searching 
for better economic opportunities or leaving drought-stricken areas
in search of better circumstances. There are many people around the world
who have been displaced because of natural disasters, food insecurities, and other hardships, but international law, rightly or wrongly, only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees. So what happens when someone
flees their country? Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous with limited access to shelter,
water, or food. Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries. Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling by standard routes. This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers to help them cross borders. Whereas some people seek safety
with their families, others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later. This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long. While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments. Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country. But resettlement and long-term 
integration options are often limited. So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades. Once in a new country, the first legal
step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum. At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted. While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee. Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially. Host countries have several duties towards people they have 
recognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and non-discrimination. The most basic obligation towards refugees
is non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened. In reality, however, refugees are
frequently the victims of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment. They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism. And all too often, they aren't permitted
to enter the work force and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid. In addition, far too many refugee children
are out of school due to lack of funding 
for education programs. If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that
at a certain point, your ancestors were forced 
from their homes, either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution. It would be good of us to remember
their stories when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced, searching for a new home.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: What term refers to people who have fled their homes but are still within their own countries?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the difference between refugees and internally displaced persons (IDP), it addresses a key concept related to the distinction between the two terms. The correct answer to this question would be "C. Internally displaced persons," which is closely related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (B. Refugees cross an international border and seek refuge outside of their countries of nationality while internally displaced persons do not).

However, an even more similar question is not present among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 5: What is the main difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee"?**

This question is similar in structure and intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the difference between two related terms. Although the specific terms are different ("migrant" and "refugee" instead of "refugees" and "internally displaced persons"), the question format and the focus on distinguishing between related concepts make it the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the definition of an asylum seeker. The closest match among the generated MCQs is Question 7: "What is the first legal step for a displaced person in a new country?" Options: A. To apply for citizenship, B. To apply for asylum, C. To apply for a visa, D. To apply for a work permit.

Although this question does not directly ask for the definition of an asylum seeker, it is related to the concept of asylum seekers. The correct option "B. To apply for asylum" implies that an asylum seeker is someone who is seeking to be recognized by a host country as a refugee, which aligns with the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that it is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people
who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution. The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries. Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries. They are commonly referred to as refugees. But what exactly does that term mean? The world has known refugees 
for millennia, but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War. It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality, and is unable to return 
to their home country because of well-founded fears
of being persecuted. That persecution may be due to their race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion, and is often related to war and violence. Today, roughly half the world's refugees
are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation. Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes. But before we get 
to what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up. There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee." "Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution, such as searching 
for better economic opportunities or leaving drought-stricken areas
in search of better circumstances. There are many people around the world
who have been displaced because of natural disasters, food insecurities, and other hardships, but international law, rightly or wrongly, only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees. So what happens when someone
flees their country? Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous with limited access to shelter,
water, or food. Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries. Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling by standard routes. This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers to help them cross borders. Whereas some people seek safety
with their families, others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later. This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long. While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments. Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country. But resettlement and long-term 
integration options are often limited. So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades. Once in a new country, the first legal
step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum. At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted. While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee. Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially. Host countries have several duties towards people they have 
recognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and non-discrimination. The most basic obligation towards refugees
is non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened. In reality, however, refugees are
frequently the victims of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment. They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism. And all too often, they aren't permitted
to enter the work force and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid. In addition, far too many refugee children
are out of school due to lack of funding 
for education programs. If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that
at a certain point, your ancestors were forced 
from their homes, either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution. It would be good of us to remember
their stories when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced, searching for a new home.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What principle prevents a nation from sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom are threatened? Options: A. Non-discrimination, B. Non-refoulement, C. Human rights, D. Asylum Correct Option: None**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only mentions one principle (non-refoulement) and does not include the other options mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (non-discrimination and recognizing and protecting basic human rights and freedom).

A more suitable match would be a question that includes all the options mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose **Question 8**, but with the caveat that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What makes a book a book? Is it just anything that stores
and communicates information? Or does it have to do with paper, binding, font, ink,
its weight in your hands, the smell of the pages? Is this a book? Probably not. But is this? To answer these questions, we need to go back to the start
of the book as we know it and understand how these elements
came together to make something more than the sum of their parts. The earliest object that we think
of as a book is the codex: a stack of pages bound along one edge. But the real turning point in book history was Johannes Gutenberg's
printing press in the mid-15th century. The concept of moveable type had been
invented much earlier in Eastern culture, but the introduction of Gutenberg's
press had a profound effect. Suddenly, an elite class of monks
and the ruling class no longer controlled 
the production of texts. Messages could spread more easily, and copies could constantly be produced, so printing houses popped
up all over Europe. The product of this bibliographic boom
is familiar to us in some respects, but markedly different in others. The skeleton of the book is paper,
type, and cover. More than 2,000 years ago,
China invented paper as a writing surface, which was itself predated 
by Egyptian papyrus. However, until the 16th century, Europeans mainly wrote 
on thin sheets of wood and durable parchment
made of stretched animal skins. Eventually, the popularity of paper
spread throughout Europe, replacing parchment for most printings
because it was less expensive in bulk. Inks had been made by combining
organic plant and animal dyes with water or wine, but since water doesn't stick
to metal type, use of the printing press required
a change to oil-based ink. Printers used black ink made of
a mixture of lamp soot, turpentine, and walnut oil. And what about font size and type? The earliest movable type pieces
consisted of reversed letters cast in relief on the ends
of lead alloy stocks. They were handmade and expensive, and the designs were as different
as the people who carved their molds. Standardization was not really possible
until mass manufacturing and the creation of an accessible
word processing system. As for style, we can thank Nicolas Jenson
for developing two types of Roman font that led to thousands of others, including the familiar Times Roman. Something had to hold all this together, and until the late 15th century, covers consisted of either wood, or sheets of paper pasted together. These would eventually be replaced
by rope fiber millboard, originally intended for high quality
bindings in the late 17th century, but later as a less expensive option. And while today's mass produced
cover illustrations are marketing tools, the cover designs of early books 
were made to order. Even spines have a history. Initially, they were not considered
aesthetically important, and the earliest ones were flat,
rather than rounded. The flat form made the books
easier to read by allowing the book to rest easily
on a table. But those spines were damaged
easily from the stresses of normal use. A rounded form solved that issue, although new problems arose, like having the book close
in on itself. But flexibility was more important, especially for the on-the-go reader. As the book evolves
and we replace bound texts with flat screens and electronic ink, are these objects and files really books? Does the feel of the cover or the smell of the paper add something
crucial to the experience? Or does the magic live only
within the words, no matter what their presentation?

of the book as we know it and understand how these elements
came together to make something more than the sum of their parts. The earliest object that we think
of as a book is the codex: a stack of pages bound along one edge. But the real turning point in book history was Johannes Gutenberg's
printing press in the mid-15th century. The concept of moveable type had been
invented much earlier in Eastern culture, but the introduction of Gutenberg's
press had a profound effect. Suddenly, an elite class of monks
and the ruling class no longer controlled 
the production of texts. Messages could spread more easily, and copies could constantly be produced, so printing houses popped
up all over Europe. The product of this bibliographic boom
is familiar to us in some respects, but markedly different in others. The skeleton of the book is paper,
type, and cover. More than 2,000 years ago,
China invented paper as a writing surface, which was itself predated 
by Egyptian papyrus. However, until the 16th century, Europeans mainly wrote 
on thin sheets of wood and durable parchment
made of stretched animal skins. Eventually, the popularity of paper
spread throughout Europe, replacing parchment for most printings
because it was less expensive in bulk. Inks had been made by combining
organic plant and animal dyes with water or wine, but since water doesn't stick
to metal type, use of the printing press required
a change to oil-based ink. Printers used black ink made of
a mixture of lamp soot, turpentine, and walnut oil. And what about font size and type? The earliest movable type pieces
consisted of reversed letters cast in relief on the ends
of lead alloy stocks. They were handmade and expensive, and the designs were as different
as the people who carved their molds. Standardization was not really possible
until mass manufacturing and the creation of an accessible
word processing system. As for style, we can thank Nicolas Jenson
for developing two types of Roman font that led to thousands of others, including the familiar Times Roman. Something had to hold all this together, and until the late 15th century, covers consisted of either wood, or sheets of paper pasted together. These would eventually be replaced
by rope fiber millboard, originally intended for high quality
bindings in the late 17th century, but later as a less expensive option. And while today's mass produced
cover illustrations are marketing tools, the cover designs of early books 
were made to order. Even spines have a history. Initially, they were not considered
aesthetically important, and the earliest ones were flat,
rather than rounded. The flat form made the books
easier to read by allowing the book to rest easily
on a table. But those spines were damaged
easily from the stresses of normal use. A rounded form solved that issue, although new problems arose, like having the book close
in on itself. But flexibility was more important, especially for the on-the-go reader. As the book evolves
and we replace bound texts with flat screens and electronic ink, are these objects and files really books? Does the feel of the cover or the smell of the paper add something
crucial to the experience? Or does the magic live only
within the words, no matter what their presentation?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "What is a book?" and provides options that include a bound set of pages, an electronic text, and a combination of both. The generated MCQs do not directly ask this question, but some of them relate to the physical characteristics or historical development of books.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 comes closest to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the earliest object considered a book (codex). However, its options and intent do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would suggest Question 1, but with the caveat that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1

Please note that the generated MCQs seem to focus more on the historical development and physical characteristics of books, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks a more philosophical question about the nature of a book. Therefore, the match is not exact, and the generated MCQs may not fully capture the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As we walk through our daily environments, we're surrounded by exotic creatures that are too small to see 
with the naked eye. We usually imagine these 
microscopic organisms, or microbes, as asocial cells that float around
by themselves. But in reality, 
microbes gather by the millions to form vast communities 
known as biofilms. Natural biofilms are like 
miniature jungles filled with many kinds of microbes
from across the web of life. Bacteria and archaea mingle with
other microbes like algae, fungi, and protozoa, forming dense, organized structures
that grow on almost any surface. When you pad across a river bottom, touch the rind of an aged cheese, tend your garden soil, or brush your teeth, you're coming into contact with these
invisible ecosystems. To see how biofilms come about, let's watch one as it develops
on a submerged river rock. This type of biofilm might begin
with a few bacteria swimming through their liquid environment. The cells use rotating flagella
to propel towards the surface of the rock, which they attach to with the help
of sticky appendages. Then, they start producing an
extracellular matrix that holds them together as they divide
and reproduce. Before long, microcolonies arise, clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,
glue-like material. Microcolonies grow to become towers, while water channels flow around them, functioning like a basic 
circulatory system. But why do microbes build 
such complex communities when they could live alone? For one thing, microbes 
living in a biofilm are rooted in a relatively 
stable microenvironment where they may have access 
to a nutrient source. There's also safety in numbers. Out in the deep, dark wilderness
of the microbial world, isolated microbes face serious risks. Predators want to eat them, immune systems seek to destroy them, and there are physical dangers, too, like running out of water
and drying up. However, in a biofilm, 
the extracellular matrix shields microbes from external threats. Biofilms also enable interactions
between individual cells. When microbes are packed against 
each other in close proximity, they can communicate, exchange genetic information, and engage in cooperative
and competitive social behaviors. Take the soil in your garden, home to thousands of bacterial species. As one species colonizes a plant root, its individual cells might differentiate
into various subpopulations, each carrying out a specific task. Matrix producers pump out 
the extracellular goo, swimmers assemble flagella
and are free to move about or migrate, and spore-formers produce dormant,
tough endospores that survive starvation, temperature extremes, and harmful radiation. This phenomenon is called 
division of labor. Ultimately, it gives rise to 
a sophisticated system of cooperation that's somewhat like 
a multicellular organism in itself. But because biofilms often contain
many different microbes that aren't closely related to each other, interactions can also be competitive. Bacteria launch vicious attacks 
on their competitors by secreting chemicals 
into the environment, or by deploying molecular spears
to inject nearby cells with toxins that literally blow them up. In the end, competition 
is all about resources. If one species eliminates another, it keeps more space and food for itself. Although this dramatic life cycle
occurs beyond the limits of our vision, microbial communities provide humans
and other species with tangible, and sometimes even delicious, benefits. Microbes make up a major fraction
of the biomass on Earth and play a critical role 
within the global ecosystem that supports all larger organisms, including us. They produce much of the oxygen we breath, and are recruited to clean up
environmental pollution, like oil spills, or to treat our waste water. Not to mention, biofilms are normal
and flavor enhancing parts of many of the foods we enjoy, including cheese, salami, and kombucha. So the next time you brush your teeth, bite into that cheese rind, sift through garden soil, or skip a river stone, look as close as you can. Imagine the microbial jungles

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the question itself does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, the options provided in Question 2 (particularly option C) align with the definition of a biofilm as described in the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ defines a biofilm as a community of microbes that includes many different species interacting together, like a jungle ecosystem, and has a physical structure or architecture. Question 2 describes the types of microbes that can be found in natural biofilms, which includes a variety of microbes interacting together.

However, a more suitable match could be constructed by combining elements of Question 2 and Question 1, as Question 1 refers to the physical structure of biofilms (vast communities of microbes that form on almost any surface). Nonetheless, among the provided options, Question 2 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
As we walk through our daily environments, we're surrounded by exotic creatures that are too small to see 
with the naked eye. We usually imagine these 
microscopic organisms, or microbes, as asocial cells that float around
by themselves. But in reality, 
microbes gather by the millions to form vast communities 
known as biofilms. Natural biofilms are like 
miniature jungles filled with many kinds of microbes
from across the web of life. Bacteria and archaea mingle with
other microbes like algae, fungi, and protozoa, forming dense, organized structures
that grow on almost any surface. When you pad across a river bottom, touch the rind of an aged cheese, tend your garden soil, or brush your teeth, you're coming into contact with these
invisible ecosystems. To see how biofilms come about, let's watch one as it develops
on a submerged river rock. This type of biofilm might begin
with a few bacteria swimming through their liquid environment. The cells use rotating flagella
to propel towards the surface of the rock, which they attach to with the help
of sticky appendages. Then, they start producing an
extracellular matrix that holds them together as they divide
and reproduce. Before long, microcolonies arise, clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,
glue-like material. Microcolonies grow to become towers, while water channels flow around them, functioning like a basic 
circulatory system. But why do microbes build 
such complex communities when they could live alone? For one thing, microbes 
living in a biofilm are rooted in a relatively 
stable microenvironment where they may have access 
to a nutrient source. There's also safety in numbers. Out in the deep, dark wilderness
of the microbial world, isolated microbes face serious risks. Predators want to eat them, immune systems seek to destroy them, and there are physical dangers, too, like running out of water
and drying up. However, in a biofilm, 
the extracellular matrix shields microbes from external threats. Biofilms also enable interactions
between individual cells. When microbes are packed against 
each other in close proximity, they can communicate, exchange genetic information, and engage in cooperative
and competitive social behaviors. Take the soil in your garden, home to thousands of bacterial species. As one species colonizes a plant root, its individual cells might differentiate

**Transcript**:
When it was ratified in 1789, the U.S. Constitution didn't just
institute a government by the people. It provided a way for the people to alter
the constitution itself. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments
proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. So what is it that makes the Constitution
so hard to change? In short, its creators. The founders of the United States
were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies, which needed assurance that their 
agreements couldn't be easily undone. So here's what they decided. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive 
a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress, or a request from two-thirds 
of state legislatures to call a national convention, and that's just the first step. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified
by three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have
its legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate 
ratification convention with delegates elected by voters. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, 
the American Constitution is quite static. Most other democracies pass amendments
every couple of years. The U.S., on the other hand, 
hasn't passed one since 1992. At this point, you may wonder how any
amendments managed to pass at all. The first ten, 
known as the Bill of Rights, includes some of America's 
most well-known freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. These were passed all at once to resolve some conflicts from 
the original Constitutional Convention. Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment,
which abolished slavery, as well as the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments, only passed after a bloody civil war. Ratifying amendments 
has also become harder as the country has grown larger
and more diverse. The first ever proposed amendment, a formula to assign 
congressional representatives, was on the verge of ratification
in the 1790s. However, as more and more states
joined the union, the number needed to reach 
the three-quarter mark increased as well, leaving it unratified to this day. Today, there are many 
suggested amendments, including outlawing 
the burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support,
their likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically
polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach
a broad consensus. In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's
representative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total
population to block an amendment. Of course, the simplest solution would be
to make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the thresholds required
for proposal and ratification. That, however, would require 
its own amendment. Instead, historical progress has mainly
come from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has expanded its interpretation
of existing constitutional laws to keep up with the times. Considering that Supreme Court justices
are unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from 
the most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves
may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote 
that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed
or repealed since every political process 
is full of obstacles that distort the will of the people. Although he believed that the basic principles 
of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs
to the living, and not to the dead.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 only addresses the proposal of an amendment and not the ratification, I continued to analyze the generated MCQs. I found that Question 4 addresses the ratification of an amendment.

Considering that the ground truth MCQ asks about both proposal and ratification, I couldn't find a single generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 3, as it partially addresses the proposal aspect of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is a thinker who helps us understand
why our lives and relationships are full of so much confusion and pain. He tells us why
life is hard, and how to cope. His own life incurred a lot of anxiety. Sigmund
Schlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish family in 1856. His professional life was not an immediate
success. As a medical student, he dissected hundreds of eels in an unsuccessful attempt
to locate their reproductive organs. He promoted cocaine as a medical drug, but
it turned out to be a dangerous and addictive idea. A few years later he founded the discipline
that would ultimately make his name. A new psychological medicine he called PSYCHOANALYSIS The landmark study was his 1900 book The Interpretation
of Dreams. Many others followed. Despite his success, he was often unhappy. During some particularly strenuous research
he recorded, “The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself…” He was convinced he would
die between 61 and 62 and had great phobias about those numbers. (Although he actually
died much later, at age 83.) Perhaps because of his frustrations, Freud
achieved a series of deep insights into the sources of human unhappiness. He proposed that we are all driven by the: Pleasure Principle which inclines us towards easy physical and
emotional rewards: and away from unpleasant things like drudgery
and discipline. As infants we are guided more or less solely according to the pleasure principle,
Freud argued. But it will, if adhered to without constraints,
lead us to dangerous reckless things: like never doing any work
eating too much or, most notoriously, sleeping with members
of own family. We need to adjust to what Freud called THE REALITY PRINCIPLE Though we all have to bow to this reality
principle, Freud believed that there were better and worse kinds of adaptations. He
called the troublesome ones NEUROSES Neuroses are the result of faulty negotiations
with –or in Freud’s language, repression of–the pleasure principle. Freud described a conflict between three parts
of our minds: the ID driven by the pleasure principle, and the THE SUPEREGO driven by a desire to follow the rules and
do the right thing according to society. and the EGO which has to somehow accomodate the two. To understand more about these dynamics, Freud
urged us to think back to the origins of our neuroses in childhood. As we grow up, we go through what Freud termed: THE ORAL PHASE where we deal with all the feelings around
ingestion and eating. If our parents aren’t careful we might pick
up all kinds of neuroses here: we might take pleasure in refusing food, or turn to food
to calm ourselves down, or hate the idea of depending on anyone else for food. Then comes THE ANAL PHASE which is closely aligned with what we now
call “potty-training”. During this period, our parents tell us what
to do--and when to go. At this phase we begin to learn about testing the limits of authority. Again, if things go wrong, if we don’t feel
authority is benign enough, we might, for example, choose to withhold out of defiance. Then, as adults, we might become “anally
retentive”; in other words, not able to give or surrender. Next comes: THE PHALLIC PHASE which goes until about age 6. Freud shocked
his contemporaries by insisting that little children have sexual feelings. Moreover, in
the phallic phase children direct their sexual impulses towards their parents, the most immediately
available and gratifying people around. Freud famously described what he called THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX Where we are unconsciously predisposed towards “being in love with the one parent and hating the other.” What is complex is that no matter how much
our parents love us, they cannot extend this to sexual life and will always have another
life with a partner. This makes our young selves feel dangerously jealous and angry
– and also ashamed and guilty about this anger. The complex provides a huge amount
of internalised worry for a small child. Ultimately, most of us experience some form of confusion around our parents that later ties into our ideas of love. Mum and dad may both give us love, but they
often mix it in with disturbed behaviour. Yet because we love them, we remain loyal
to them and also to their bizarre, destructive patterns. For example, if our mother is cold,
we will be apt nevertheless to long for her. And as a result, however, we may be prone
to always associate love with a certain distance. Naturally, the result is very difficult adult
relationships. Often the kind of love we’ve learned from mum and dad means we can’t
fuse sex and love because the people we learnt about love from are also those we were blocked
from having sex with. We might find that the more in love with someone we are, the harder
it becomes to make love to them. This can reach a pitch of crisis after a few years
of marriage and some kids. Freud compared the issues we so often have
with intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter: they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also
can’t come too close because they’re prickly. There’s no easy solution. Freud says we
can’t make ourselves fully rational, and we can’t change society, either. In his
1930 book Civilisation and its Discontents, Freud wrote that society provides us with
many things, but it does this by imposing heavy dictates on us: insisting that we sleep
with only a few (usually one) other, imposing the incest taboo, requiring us to put off
our immediate desires, demanding that we follow authority and work to make money. Societies
themselves are neurotic–that is how they function - and it’s why there are constant
wars and other troubles. Freud attempted to invent a treatment for
our many neuroses: psychoanalysis. He thought that with a little proper analysis, people
could uncover what ails them and better adjust to the difficulties of reality. In his sessions he analysed a number of key
things. He looked at people’s dreams, which he saw as expressions of WISH FULFILLMENTS He also looked at PARAPRAXES or slips of the tongue. We now call these revealing mistakes FREUDIAN SLIPS Like when we write ‘thigh’ when we wanted
to write ‘though’. He also liked to think about jokes. He believed
that jokes often help us make fun of something symbolic like death or marriage, and thus
relieve some of our anxiety about these topics. There’s a temptation to say Freud just made
everything up, and life isn’t quite so hard as he makes it out to be. But then one morning
we find ourselves filled with inexplicable anger towards our partner, or running high
with unrelenting anxiety on the train to work, and we’re reminded all over again just how
elusive, difficult, and Freudian our mental workings actually are. We could still reject his work, of course.
But as Freud said, “No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.” We could all use a bit more of Freud’s ideas to help us unpick ourselves.

**Generated MCQ 2:** According to Freud, what principle drives humans towards easy physical and emotional rewards? Options: A. The Reality Principle, B. The Pleasure Principle, C. The Id Principle, D. The Ego Principle

Although this generated MCQ does not provide examples of the struggle between the pleasure principle and the reality principle, it does ask about the principle that drives humans towards easy physical and emotional rewards, which is related to the pleasure principle.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match to the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the struggle to balance the pleasure principle and the reality principle, providing examples similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Index: 2**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is a thinker who helps us understand
why our lives and relationships are full of so much confusion and pain. He tells us why
life is hard, and how to cope. His own life incurred a lot of anxiety. Sigmund
Schlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish family in 1856. His professional life was not an immediate
success. As a medical student, he dissected hundreds of eels in an unsuccessful attempt
to locate their reproductive organs. He promoted cocaine as a medical drug, but
it turned out to be a dangerous and addictive idea. A few years later he founded the discipline
that would ultimately make his name. A new psychological medicine he called PSYCHOANALYSIS The landmark study was his 1900 book The Interpretation
of Dreams. Many others followed. Despite his success, he was often unhappy. During some particularly strenuous research
he recorded, “The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself…” He was convinced he would
die between 61 and 62 and had great phobias about those numbers. (Although he actually
died much later, at age 83.) Perhaps because of his frustrations, Freud
achieved a series of deep insights into the sources of human unhappiness. He proposed that we are all driven by the: Pleasure Principle which inclines us towards easy physical and
emotional rewards: and away from unpleasant things like drudgery
and discipline. As infants we are guided more or less solely according to the pleasure principle,
Freud argued. But it will, if adhered to without constraints,
lead us to dangerous reckless things: like never doing any work
eating too much or, most notoriously, sleeping with members
of own family. We need to adjust to what Freud called THE REALITY PRINCIPLE Though we all have to bow to this reality
principle, Freud believed that there were better and worse kinds of adaptations. He
called the troublesome ones NEUROSES Neuroses are the result of faulty negotiations
with –or in Freud’s language, repression of–the pleasure principle. Freud described a conflict between three parts
of our minds: the ID driven by the pleasure principle, and the THE SUPEREGO driven by a desire to follow the rules and
do the right thing according to society. and the EGO which has to somehow accomodate the two. To understand more about these dynamics, Freud
urged us to think back to the origins of our neuroses in childhood. As we grow up, we go through what Freud termed: THE ORAL PHASE where we deal with all the feelings around
ingestion and eating. If our parents aren’t careful we might pick
up all kinds of neuroses here: we might take pleasure in refusing food, or turn to food
to calm ourselves down, or hate the idea of depending on anyone else for food. Then comes THE ANAL PHASE which is closely aligned with what we now
call “potty-training”. During this period, our parents tell us what
to do--and when to go. At this phase we begin to learn about testing the limits of authority. Again, if things go wrong, if we don’t feel
authority is benign enough, we might, for example, choose to withhold out of defiance. Then, as adults, we might become “anally
retentive”; in other words, not able to give or surrender. Next comes: THE PHALLIC PHASE which goes until about age 6. Freud shocked
his contemporaries by insisting that little children have sexual feelings. Moreover, in
the phallic phase children direct their sexual impulses towards their parents, the most immediately
available and gratifying people around. Freud famously described what he called THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX Where we are unconsciously predisposed towards “being in love with the one parent and hating the other.” What is complex is that no matter how much
our parents love us, they cannot extend this to sexual life and will always have another
life with a partner. This makes our young selves feel dangerously jealous and angry
– and also ashamed and guilty about this anger. The complex provides a huge amount
of internalised worry for a small child. Ultimately, most of us experience some form of confusion around our parents that later ties into our ideas of love. Mum and dad may both give us love, but they
often mix it in with disturbed behaviour. Yet because we love them, we remain loyal
to them and also to their bizarre, destructive patterns. For example, if our mother is cold,
we will be apt nevertheless to long for her. And as a result, however, we may be prone
to always associate love with a certain distance. Naturally, the result is very difficult adult
relationships. Often the kind of love we’ve learned from mum and dad means we can’t
fuse sex and love because the people we learnt about love from are also those we were blocked
from having sex with. We might find that the more in love with someone we are, the harder
it becomes to make love to them. This can reach a pitch of crisis after a few years
of marriage and some kids. Freud compared the issues we so often have
with intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter: they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also
can’t come too close because they’re prickly. There’s no easy solution. Freud says we
can’t make ourselves fully rational, and we can’t change society, either. In his
1930 book Civilisation and its Discontents, Freud wrote that society provides us with
many things, but it does this by imposing heavy dictates on us: insisting that we sleep
with only a few (usually one) other, imposing the incest taboo, requiring us to put off
our immediate desires, demanding that we follow authority and work to make money. Societies
themselves are neurotic–that is how they function - and it’s why there are constant
wars and other troubles. Freud attempted to invent a treatment for
our many neuroses: psychoanalysis. He thought that with a little proper analysis, people
could uncover what ails them and better adjust to the difficulties of reality. In his sessions he analysed a number of key
things. He looked at people’s dreams, which he saw as expressions of WISH FULFILLMENTS He also looked at PARAPRAXES or slips of the tongue. We now call these revealing mistakes FREUDIAN SLIPS Like when we write ‘thigh’ when we wanted
to write ‘though’. He also liked to think about jokes. He believed
that jokes often help us make fun of something symbolic like death or marriage, and thus
relieve some of our anxiety about these topics. There’s a temptation to say Freud just made
everything up, and life isn’t quite so hard as he makes it out to be. But then one morning
we find ourselves filled with inexplicable anger towards our partner, or running high
with unrelenting anxiety on the train to work, and we’re reminded all over again just how
elusive, difficult, and Freudian our mental workings actually are. We could still reject his work, of course.
But as Freud said, “No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.” We could all use a bit more of Freud’s ideas to help us unpick ourselves.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of content and theme.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Freud's examples of societal restrictions leading to large-scale societal neuroses, and the correct answer is "war and social injustice." While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 8 asks about the title of Freud's 1930 book that explores the relationship between civilization and human unhappiness. The correct answer to this question is "Civilization and its Discontents," which is a book where Freud discusses the idea that society imposes restrictions on individuals, leading to neuroses.

Although the question intent and options are not identical, Question 8 is the closest match in terms of content and theme.

**Transcript**:
More than a century after first emerging into the fog-bound,
gas-lit streets of Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes 
is universally recognizable. Even his wardrobe and accessories
are iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend
and housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular
consciousness, as have his extraordinary,
infallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase,
"Elementary, my dear Watson." And yet many of these most recognizable
features of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's
original stories. Doyle's great detective solves
crimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses,
and regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson 
is barely mentioned, no one says, "Elementary, my dear Watson," and the detective and his sidekick
live apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain, 
only appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent
after the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled
to the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form
of natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements
of the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape
were first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by
American actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see
his face on stage, and the phrase, 
"Elementary, my dear Watson," was coined by author and humorist
P.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective,
and where do we find him? Purists might answer 
that the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 
university mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version
of Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective 
largely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying
answer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider
the vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands 
of adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted
fictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian
stage adaptations, and accelerated 
with the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations
of Holmes in the first two decades 
of the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands
more in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted
by people everywhere, in remarkably different,
and often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate
both Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number
of allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining 
the Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service
hideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various
German-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been
much-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes
please stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation
has made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new
interpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock 
continually evolves, embodying ideas and values 
often far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends,
Sherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms
or turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock,
our Sherlock.

**Transcript**:
More than a century after first emerging into the fog-bound,
gas-lit streets of Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes 
is universally recognizable. Even his wardrobe and accessories
are iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend
and housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular
consciousness, as have his extraordinary,
infallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase,
"Elementary, my dear Watson." And yet many of these most recognizable
features of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's
original stories. Doyle's great detective solves
crimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses,
and regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson 
is barely mentioned, no one says, "Elementary, my dear Watson," and the detective and his sidekick
live apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain, 
only appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent
after the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled
to the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form
of natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements
of the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape
were first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by
American actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see
his face on stage, and the phrase, 
"Elementary, my dear Watson," was coined by author and humorist
P.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective,
and where do we find him? Purists might answer 
that the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 
university mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version
of Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective 
largely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying
answer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider
the vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands 
of adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted
fictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian
stage adaptations, and accelerated 
with the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations
of Holmes in the first two decades 
of the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands
more in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted
by people everywhere, in remarkably different,
and often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate
both Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number
of allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining 
the Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service
hideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various
German-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been
much-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes
please stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation
has made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new
interpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock 
continually evolves, embodying ideas and values 
often far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends,
Sherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms
or turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock,
our Sherlock.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the musical instrument Sherlock Holmes plays, while the generated MCQs cover various other aspects of Sherlock Holmes.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it asks about a specific aspect of Sherlock Holmes' character, I would choose:

**Question 2: What iconic items are often associated with Sherlock Holmes' appearance?**

This question is similar in that it asks about a specific aspect of Sherlock Holmes' character, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent or options.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: **2**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the musical instrument Sherlock Holmes plays would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
What is consciousness? Can an artificial machine really think? Does the mind just consist of neurons
in the brain, or is there some intangible spark
at its core? For many, these have been
vital considerations for the future of artificial intelligence. But British computer scientist Alan Turing
decided to disregard all these questions in favor of a much simpler one: can a computer talk like a human? This question led to an idea for measuring
aritificial intelligence that would famously come to be known
as the Turing test. In the 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery
and Intelligence," Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation
with unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must
be able to replace one of the players without substantially 
changing the results. In other words, a computer would be
considered intelligent if its conversation couldn't be easily
distinguished from a human's. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 megabytes of memory
would be able to easily pass his test. But he may have jumped the gun. Even though today's computers
have far more memory than that, few have succeeded, and those that have done well focused more on finding clever ways
to fool judges than using overwhelming computing power. Though it was never subjected
to a real test, the first program with 
some claim to success was called ELIZA. With only a fairly short 
and simple script, it managed to mislead many people
by mimicking a psychologist, encouraging them to talk more and reflecting their own questions
back at them. Another early script PARRY
took the opposite approach by imitating a paranoid schizophrenic who kept steering the conversation
back to his own preprogrammed obsessions. Their success in fooling people
highlighted one weakness of the test. Humans regularly attribute intelligence
to a whole range of things that are not actually intelligent. Nonetheless, annual competitions
like the Loebner Prize, have made the test more formal with judges knowing ahead of time that some of their conversation partners 
are machines. But while the quality has improved, many chatbot programmers have used
similar strategies to ELIZA and PARRY. 1997's winner Catherine could carry on amazingly focused 
and intelligent conversation, but mostly if the judge wanted
to talk about Bill Clinton. And the more recent winner
Eugene Goostman was given the persona
of a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, so judges interpreted its nonsequiturs
and awkward grammar as language and culture barriers. Meanwhile, other programs like Cleverbot
have taken a different approach by statistically analyzing huge databases
of real conversations to determine the best responses. Some also store memories 
of previous conversations in order to improve over time. But while Cleverbot's individual responses
can sound incredibly human, its lack of a consistent personality and inability to deal 
with brand new topics are a dead giveaway. Who in Turing's day could have predicted
that today's computers would be able to pilot spacecraft, perform delicate surgeries, and solve massive equations, but still struggle with 
the most basic small talk? Human language turns out to be
an amazingly complex phenomenon that can't be captured by even
the largest dictionary. Chatbots can be baffled by simple pauses,
like "umm..." or questions with no correct answer. And a simple conversational sentence, like, "I took the juice out of the fridge
and gave it to him, but forgot to check the date," requires a wealth of underlying knowledge
and intuition to parse. It turns out that simulating 
a human conversation takes more than just increasing
memory and processing power, and as we get closer to Turing's goal, we may have to deal with all those big
questions about consciousness after all.

with unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must
be able to replace one of the players without substantially 
changing the results. In other words, a computer would be
considered intelligent if its conversation couldn't be easily
distinguished from a human's. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 megabytes of memory
would be able to easily pass his test. But he may have jumped the gun. Even though today's computers
have far more memory than that, few have succeeded, and those that have done well focused more on finding clever ways
to fool judges than using overwhelming computing power. Though it was never subjected
to a real test, the first program with 
some claim to success was called ELIZA. With only a fairly short 
and simple script, it managed to mislead many people
by mimicking a psychologist, encouraging them to talk more and reflecting their own questions
back at them. Another early script PARRY
took the opposite approach by imitating a paranoid schizophrenic who kept steering the conversation
back to his own preprogrammed obsessions. Their success in fooling people
highlighted one weakness of the test. Humans regularly attribute intelligence
to a whole range of things that are not actually intelligent. Nonetheless, annual competitions
like the Loebner Prize, have made the test more formal with judges knowing ahead of time that some of their conversation partners 
are machines. But while the quality has improved, many chatbot programmers have used
similar strategies to ELIZA and PARRY. 1997's winner Catherine could carry on amazingly focused 
and intelligent conversation, but mostly if the judge wanted
to talk about Bill Clinton. And the more recent winner
Eugene Goostman was given the persona
of a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, so judges interpreted its nonsequiturs
and awkward grammar as language and culture barriers. Meanwhile, other programs like Cleverbot
have taken a different approach by statistically analyzing huge databases
of real conversations to determine the best responses. Some also store memories 
of previous conversations in order to improve over time. But while Cleverbot's individual responses
can sound incredibly human, its lack of a consistent personality and inability to deal 
with brand new topics are a dead giveaway. Who in Turing's day could have predicted
that today's computers would be able to pilot spacecraft, perform delicate surgeries, and solve massive equations, but still struggle with 
the most basic small talk? Human language turns out to be
an amazingly complex phenomenon that can't be captured by even
the largest dictionary. Chatbots can be baffled by simple pauses,
like "umm..." or questions with no correct answer. And a simple conversational sentence, like, "I took the juice out of the fridge
and gave it to him, but forgot to check the date," requires a wealth of underlying knowledge
and intuition to parse. It turns out that simulating 
a human conversation takes more than just increasing
memory and processing power, and as we get closer to Turing's goal, we may have to deal with all those big
questions about consciousness after all.

**Transcript**:
You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part
when suddenly he interrupts, "The alien and I," not "Me and the alien." Most of us would probably be annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your sentence actually 
grammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it,
why does it even matter? From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns 
for how words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing. Different languages 
have different patterns. In English, the subject 
normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese 
and many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb. Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called 
linguistic universals have been found. And while any language needs consistent
patterns to function, the study of these patterns opens up
an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism
and descriptivism. Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language 
should follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation
and adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language. For much of history, the vast majority
of language was spoken. But as people became more interconnected
and writing gained importance, written language was standardized
to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts
of a realm could understand each other. In many languages, this standard form
came to be considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one
of many spoken varieties, usually that of the people in power. Language purists worked to establish
and propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected
the established grammar of their times. And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well. Speech patterns that deviated from the
written rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people who had grown up
speaking in these ways were forced to adopt 
the standardized form. More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech
is a separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns. Most of us learn to speak at such an early
age that we don't even remember it. We form our spoken repertoire through
unconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses mood
and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers
and listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses
that are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward
pronounciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster. The linguistic approach that tries
to understand and map such differences without dictating correct ones
is known as descriptivism. Rather than deciding how language
should be used, it describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations 
they come up with in the process. But while the debate between prescriptivism 
and descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive. At its best, prescriptivism is useful
for informing people about the most common established
patterns at a given point in time. This is important, 
not only for formal contexts, but it also makes communication easier
between non-native speakers from different backgrounds. Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the instinctive ways in which we 
structure our view of the world. Ultimately, grammar is best thought of
as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated
and reinvented by the entire group of language users. Like language itself, it's a wonderful and complex fabric woven through the contributions
of speakers and listeners, writers and readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far.

the established grammar of their times. And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well. Speech patterns that deviated from the
written rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people who had grown up
speaking in these ways were forced to adopt 
the standardized form. More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech
is a separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns. Most of us learn to speak at such an early
age that we don't even remember it. We form our spoken repertoire through
unconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses mood
and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers
and listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses
that are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward
pronounciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster. The linguistic approach that tries
to understand and map such differences without dictating correct ones
is known as descriptivism. Rather than deciding how language
should be used, it describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations 
they come up with in the process. But while the debate between prescriptivism 
and descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive. At its best, prescriptivism is useful
for informing people about the most common established
patterns at a given point in time. This is important, 
not only for formal contexts, but it also makes communication easier
between non-native speakers from different backgrounds. Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the instinctive ways in which we 
structure our view of the world. Ultimately, grammar is best thought of
as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated
and reinvented by the entire group of language users. Like language itself, it's a wonderful and complex fabric woven through the contributions
of speakers and listeners, writers and readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as Question 4: "Why was written language standardized in many languages?"

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and the correct option (B) of Question 4 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks why a dialect of a given language may become the standard variety, and the correct option (B) states that it is "mostly due to coincidental factors, and often due to being spoken by the people in power." Similarly, Question 4 asks why written language was standardized, and the correct answer (according to the transcript) is that it was to ensure that people in different parts of a realm could understand each other, which is related to the idea of a dialect becoming standard due to the influence of those in power.

**Transcript**:
You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part
when suddenly he interrupts, "The alien and I," not "Me and the alien." Most of us would probably be annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your sentence actually 
grammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it,
why does it even matter? From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns 
for how words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing. Different languages 
have different patterns. In English, the subject 
normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese 
and many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb. Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called 
linguistic universals have been found. And while any language needs consistent
patterns to function, the study of these patterns opens up
an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism
and descriptivism. Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language 
should follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation
and adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language. For much of history, the vast majority
of language was spoken. But as people became more interconnected
and writing gained importance, written language was standardized
to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts
of a realm could understand each other. In many languages, this standard form
came to be considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one
of many spoken varieties, usually that of the people in power. Language purists worked to establish
and propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected
the established grammar of their times. And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well. Speech patterns that deviated from the

**Transcript**:
Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary
in the minds of hikers, adventurers, and dreamers alike.

gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary

**Transcript**:
Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks

**Transcript**:
Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary
in the minds of hikers, adventurers, and dreamers alike.

**Transcript**:
In 1996, 56 volunteers took part
in a study to test a new painkiller called
Trivaricaine. On each subject, one index finger
was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed
in painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated
finger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually
a painkiller, just a fake concotion 
with no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure
this dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies
that aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo
since the 1700s when they realized the power of
fake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs
weren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo
means "I shall please" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating
troubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments
in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people
in this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using
placebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive
the real pill. The other half would get a placebo
that looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether
they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant
benefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos
this way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug
against an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving
someone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used
as a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus
the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos
exert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief 
from a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received
was a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused
with other factors, like patients trying to please doctors
by falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person 
believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually
do trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing
measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing
chemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies
often say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels
of stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects
of an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate
the placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment
has cured them, they may miss out on drugs
or therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects 
may fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even 
more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about
the human body, there are still some strange
and enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels
might we contain? It's easy to investigate the world
around us and forget that one of its most 
fascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: What is one theory about how the placebo effect works?**

Although the question is not an exact match, the options provided in Question 7 are related to the concept of the placebo effect, and option C ("The placebo effect is triggered by a person's expectations of recovery") is closely related to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ ("It's what occurs when a treatment has an effect even though it's fake").

However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the definition of the placebo effect. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose:

**Question 3: What is the term "placebo" derived from in Latin?**

This question is not directly related to the definition of the placebo effect, but it is related to the concept of placebos. However, I noticed that Question 2 is somewhat related to the concept of the placebo effect, and it mentions a "fake concoction with no pain-easing properties," which is similar to the concept of a placebo.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that combines elements of Question 2 and Question 7. However, since that is not an option, I will choose the generated MCQ that best matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I realized that Question 2 is actually a better match than Question 7 or Question 3. The correct option in Question 2 ("A fake concoction with no pain-easing properties") is closely related to the concept of a placebo, which is a treatment that has an effect even though it's fake.

Therefore, the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: What was Trivaricaine in the study mentioned in the transcript?**

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index for the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose:

**Index: 2**

Please keep in mind that this is an approximation, and the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1996, 56 volunteers took part
in a study to test a new painkiller called
Trivaricaine. On each subject, one index finger
was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed
in painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated
finger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually
a painkiller, just a fake concotion 
with no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure
this dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies
that aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo
since the 1700s when they realized the power of
fake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs
weren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo
means "I shall please" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating
troubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments
in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people
in this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using
placebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive
the real pill. The other half would get a placebo
that looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether
they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant
benefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos
this way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug
against an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving
someone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used
as a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus
the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos
exert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief 
from a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received
was a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused
with other factors, like patients trying to please doctors
by falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person 
believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually
do trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing
measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing
chemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies
often say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels
of stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects
of an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate
the placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment
has cured them, they may miss out on drugs
or therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects 
may fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even 
more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about
the human body, there are still some strange
and enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels
might we contain? It's easy to investigate the world
around us and forget that one of its most 
fascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the forms that placebos can take. A similar question is not present in the generated MCQs. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the characteristics or properties of placebos.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match, as it asks about the properties of Trivaricaine, which is a placebo. However, the options provided in Question 2 do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but the closest match would be Question 2, with the understanding that the options do not match.

Index: 2 (with the caveat that the options do not match)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not explicitly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically ask about the forms that placebos can take.

**Transcript**:
Every day, a sea of decisions 
stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact 
on our lives. For example, which politician
should I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make 
a perfect choice every time. But there are many ways 
to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique
is critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully 
deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues,
such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative
that's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer 
because it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny
and skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most
useful and reliable information. There are many different ways
of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve 
any number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, 
know what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward 
as it sounds. For example, if you're deciding
whether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured
by other factors, like claims that you'll see results
in just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're 
actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through 
this information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad
really suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question
will help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet
to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you
weigh different options, moving you closer to a decision
that meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do 
by asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself,
"What concepts are at work?" "What assumptions exist?" "Is my interpretation of the information
logically sound?" For example, in an email that promises
you millions, you should consider, "What is shaping
my approach to this situation?" "Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?" "Based on the evidence, is it logical 
to assume I'll win any money?" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political
candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers
to fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term 
environmental effects? If gasoline use is less 
restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge
surge in air pollution, an unintended consequence 
that's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of 
the opposing political candidate. Even if you disagree with 
everything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't
seem valid to you appeal to others. This will allow you 
to explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more
informed decisions. This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult
decisions from our lives. But it can help us increase 
the number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give us the tools
to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for. And if enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world
a more reasonable place.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is one advantage of critical thinking?
Options: A. It’s a process that helps us make only large, important decisions, B. It’s a process that helps us make only small, unimportant decisions, C. It’s a process that helps us create hidden issues, bias and manipulation, D. It’s a process that helps us reveal hidden issues, bias and manipulation

**Transcript**:
Every day, a sea of decisions 
stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact 
on our lives. For example, which politician
should I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make 
a perfect choice every time. But there are many ways 
to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique
is critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully 
deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues,
such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative
that's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer 
because it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny
and skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most
useful and reliable information. There are many different ways
of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve 
any number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, 
know what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward 
as it sounds. For example, if you're deciding
whether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured
by other factors, like claims that you'll see results
in just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're 
actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through 
this information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad
really suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question
will help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet
to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you
weigh different options, moving you closer to a decision
that meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do 
by asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself,
"What concepts are at work?" "What assumptions exist?" "Is my interpretation of the information
logically sound?" For example, in an email that promises
you millions, you should consider, "What is shaping
my approach to this situation?" "Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?" "Based on the evidence, is it logical 
to assume I'll win any money?" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political
candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers
to fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term 
environmental effects? If gasoline use is less 
restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge
surge in air pollution, an unintended consequence 
that's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of 
the opposing political candidate. Even if you disagree with 
everything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't
seem valid to you appeal to others. This will allow you 
to explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more
informed decisions. This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult
decisions from our lives. But it can help us increase 
the number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give us the tools
to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for. And if enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world
a more reasonable place.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 3 focus on the purpose or importance of gathering information in the decision-making process.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, they both have a correct option that highlights the importance of gathering relevant information (Option B in the ground truth MCQ and Option C in Question 3).
- Content: Both questions deal with the idea of gathering information to inform decision-making, which is a key aspect of critical thinking.

However, it's worth noting that Question 3 doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses more on the importance of having a clear idea of your question when gathering information, rather than the main purpose of gathering facts and information in general.

If I had to choose another option that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6, but with the options from Question 3 or the ground truth MCQ, as Question 6's options don't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not present.

However, the correct answer in Question 6 does not match the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ with the correct answer as "Court musician". 

Since there isn't an exact match, the closest match would be Question 6, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

However, upon closer inspection, we see that Question 6 does have an option that says "Court musician" which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. 

But an even better match is Question 3 does not match, but Question 6 has an option C "Court musician"  we see that actually, Question 6 is not the best match, the question that has the word "musician" is a good match.

Generated Question 3 has the word "musician" in the options, and the correct answer in the options of Generated Question 3 is indeed "B. Musician", and the question is about the term "Bach" being synonymous with a certain occupation, but the correct occupation for Johann Sebastian Bach is indeed a musician, and more specifically a court musician. 

However, an even better match for the ground truth MCQ would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about Johann Sebastian Bach's first job.

Among the provided generated MCQs, there isn't a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest match, it would be Generated Question 6, but it is not perfect.

However, upon even closer inspection, actually Generated Question 6 is the best match among the provided options, but it is not perfect.

The correct answer is indeed present in the options of Generated Question 6.

böck is a musical giant and his ideas and his skill almost primarily still leave us all in awe Johann Sebastian Bach was born in eisenach Germany on March 21st 1685 raised in a family of musicians Bach learned to play the harpsichord organ and violin baa came from generations of musicians the term Bach at the time that Johann Sebastian Bach lived was almost synonymous with being a musician as a young boy Bach was given a religious education which would deeply affect his life Bach was profoundly religious and he saw everything that he did as a composer and musician as basically an act of prayer after landing his first job as a court musician in 1703 Bach worked in various positions as an organist allowing him to compose Church cantatas Bach created vast numbers of works for keyboard and probably the best-known of those works is the Toccata and Fugue in d-minor and i think one of the reasons why this has risen to such great popularity was of course due to its orchestration and Walt Disney's Fantasia from 1717 to 1723 Bach composed a number of works including the widely regarded Brandenburg Concertos and the solo keyboard compositions the well-tempered clavier the Brandenburg Concertos have to be the most popular works of Bach judging from the number of recordings there of them that there are and there are numerous occasions in which all six are performed on the same concert in 1723 Bach was given a new position where he could both teach students and create an astounding collection of church music Bach was appointed Cantor or director of music for the four main churches in Leipzig Germany the cantatas that he created for this purpose contained some of his greatest music 17:33 bock composed mass in B minor which gained him a position as royal court composer to the king of Poland ba added to the mass one section at a time mostly by utilizing older Lutheran cantatas and adapting them for the mass and it of course lasts as one of Bach's greatest contributions to sacred music thought created a new composition called the art of fugue in 1749 but on July 28th of that year he died after suffering a stroke Bach is considered to be the composer who knew how to put notes together better than any other single composer Bach has a kind of popularity be outside of professional musicians and the fact that there are nearly 40 Bach Festival in this country I think it is testimony to that

However, the correct answer in Question 6 does not match the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ with the correct answer as "Court musician". 

Since there isn't an exact match, the closest match would be Question 6, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

However, upon closer inspection, we see that Question 6 does have an option that says "Court musician" which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. 

But an even better match is Question 3 does not match, but Question 6 has an option C "Court musician"  we see that actually, Question 6 is not the best match, the question that has the word "musician" is a good match.

Generated Question 3 has the word "musician" in the options, and the correct answer in the options of Generated Question 3 is indeed "B. Musician", and the question is about the term "Bach" being synonymous with a certain occupation, but the correct occupation for Johann Sebastian Bach is indeed a musician, and more specifically a court musician. 

However, an even better match for the ground truth MCQ would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about Johann Sebastian Bach's first job.

Among the provided generated MCQs, there isn't a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the closest match, it would be Generated Question 6, but it is not perfect.

**Transcript**:
In ancient Greece, violent internal
conflict between bordering neighbors and war with foreign invaders
was a way of life, and Greeks were considered
premier warriors. Most Greek city-states surrounded
themselves with massive defensive walls for added protection. Sparta in its prime was a different story, finding walls unnecessary when it had an army of the most feared
warriors in the ancient world. So what was Sparta doing differently
than everyone else to produce such fierce soldiers? To answer that question, we turn to
the written accounts of that time. There are no surviving written accounts
from Spartans themselves, as it was forbidden for Spartans
to keep records, so we have to rely on those of
non-Spartan ancient historians, like Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Plutarch. These stories may be embellished and depict Sparta 
at the apex of its power, so take them with a grain of salt. For Spartans, the purpose for their
existence was simple: to serve Sparta. On the day of their birth, elder Spartan leaders examined
every newborn. The strong healthy babies were considered
capable of fulfilling this purpose, and the others may have been left
on Mount Taygetus to die. Every Spartan, boy or girl,
was expected to be physically strong, mentally sharp, and emotionally resilient. And it was their absolute duty
to defend and promote Sparta at all costs. So in the first years of their lives, children were raised to understand that
their loyalty belonged first to Sparta, and then to family. This mindset probably made it easier
for the Spartan boys, who upon turning seven,
were sent to the agoge, a place with one main purpose: to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior through thirteen years of relentless,
harsh, and often brutal training. The Spartans prized physical perfection
above all else, and so the students spent a great deal
of their time learning how to fight. To ensure resilience in battle, boys were encouraged to fight
among themselves, and bullying, unlike today, 
was acceptable. In order to better prepare the boys
for the conditions of war, the boys were poorly fed, sometimes even going days without eating. They also were given little 
in the way of clothing so that they could learn to deal
with different temperatures. Spartan boys were encouraged
to steal in order to survive, but if they were caught, they would be disciplined, not because they stole,
but because they were caught in the act. During the annual contest of endurance in a religious ritual known as
the diamastigosis, teenage boys were whipped
in front of an altar at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. It was common for boys to die
on the altar of the goddess. Fortunately, not everything
was as brutal as that. Young Spartans were also taught
how to read, write, and dance, which taught them graceful control
of their movements and helped them in combat. While the responsibilities for the girls
of Sparta were different, the high standards of excellence and expectation to serve 
Sparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with
their mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,
they learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only
strong and capable women could bear children that would one day
become strong and capable warriors. To all Spartans, men and women, perhaps the most important lesson
from Spartan school was allegiance to Sparta. To die for their city-state was seen
as the completion of one's duty to Sparta. Upon their death, only men who died in battle
and women who died in childbirth were given tombstones. In the eyes of their countrymen,
both died so that Sparta could live.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the age at which young Spartan boys were sent to the Agoge. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 discusses the primary purpose of the Agoge in Sparta.

However, a more relevant question related to age is not present. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is somewhat related as it talks about newborn babies in Sparta and what happened to them, which is somewhat related to the topic of young boys being sent to the Agoge.

But since the correct answer is not present in any of the questions I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ.

Sparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with
their mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,
they learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only
strong and capable women could bear children that would one day
become strong and capable warriors. To all Spartans, men and women, perhaps the most important lesson
from Spartan school was allegiance to Sparta. To die for their city-state was seen
as the completion of one's duty to Sparta. Upon their death, only men who died in battle
and women who died in childbirth were given tombstones. In the eyes of their countrymen,
both died so that Sparta could live.

**Transcript**:
In ancient Greece, violent internal
conflict between bordering neighbors and war with foreign invaders
was a way of life, and Greeks were considered
premier warriors. Most Greek city-states surrounded
themselves with massive defensive walls for added protection. Sparta in its prime was a different story, finding walls unnecessary when it had an army of the most feared
warriors in the ancient world. So what was Sparta doing differently
than everyone else to produce such fierce soldiers? To answer that question, we turn to
the written accounts of that time. There are no surviving written accounts
from Spartans themselves, as it was forbidden for Spartans
to keep records, so we have to rely on those of
non-Spartan ancient historians, like Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Plutarch. These stories may be embellished and depict Sparta 
at the apex of its power, so take them with a grain of salt. For Spartans, the purpose for their
existence was simple: to serve Sparta. On the day of their birth, elder Spartan leaders examined
every newborn. The strong healthy babies were considered
capable of fulfilling this purpose, and the others may have been left
on Mount Taygetus to die. Every Spartan, boy or girl,
was expected to be physically strong, mentally sharp, and emotionally resilient. And it was their absolute duty
to defend and promote Sparta at all costs. So in the first years of their lives, children were raised to understand that
their loyalty belonged first to Sparta, and then to family. This mindset probably made it easier
for the Spartan boys, who upon turning seven,
were sent to the agoge, a place with one main purpose: to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior through thirteen years of relentless,
harsh, and often brutal training. The Spartans prized physical perfection
above all else, and so the students spent a great deal
of their time learning how to fight. To ensure resilience in battle, boys were encouraged to fight
among themselves, and bullying, unlike today, 
was acceptable. In order to better prepare the boys
for the conditions of war, the boys were poorly fed, sometimes even going days without eating. They also were given little 
in the way of clothing so that they could learn to deal
with different temperatures. Spartan boys were encouraged
to steal in order to survive, but if they were caught, they would be disciplined, not because they stole,
but because they were caught in the act. During the annual contest of endurance in a religious ritual known as
the diamastigosis, teenage boys were whipped
in front of an altar at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. It was common for boys to die
on the altar of the goddess. Fortunately, not everything
was as brutal as that. Young Spartans were also taught
how to read, write, and dance, which taught them graceful control
of their movements and helped them in combat. While the responsibilities for the girls
of Sparta were different, the high standards of excellence and expectation to serve 
Sparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with
their mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,
they learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only
strong and capable women could bear children that would one day

**Transcript**:
Rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, changing landscapes. Successfully adapting to climate change
is growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using
our technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities
and better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes
involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs
along time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under
especially strong selective conditions, like those caused 
by rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution 
can happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes
to their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes
to an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much
an organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking
examples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry
forest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard,
rather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been
near impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly
less snowfall, but you'd still struggle 
to spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically
dominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage
in helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces
opportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing 
the battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs,
on the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive 
genetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes 
have rapidly evolved to take advantage 
of the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later 
and later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers
of melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely
to the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them
from overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted
to warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season
to protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe
are producing more repellent oils to protect themselves 
against the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group
of about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations
to rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover
more species evolving in response to climate change
out of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding
and precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species
will have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is
we already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making
on-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges 
are being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help
mobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas
are also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope. Fortunately, it's still within our power to preserve much of 
the wondrous biodiversity of this planet, which, after all, sustains us
in so many ways.

Question 7: Which of the following species has adapted to warmer temperatures by entering dormancy later in the year? Options: A. Pitcher plant mosquitoes, B. Two-spot ladybugs, C. Pink salmon, D. Wild thyme plants

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that specifically asks about wild thyme plants and their adaptation to climate change.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the adaptation of wild thyme plants, but such a question is not present in the provided list. If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but it's not an exact match.

That being said, I can try to provide a more suitable index based on the available options. Since Question 7 is the closest match, I would provide its index:

Index: 7

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable question would be one that specifically asks about the adaptation of wild thyme plants.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would suggest generating a new set of MCQs that specifically ask about the adaptations of different species, including wild thyme plants, to climate change. This would increase the chances of finding an exact match.

**Transcript**:
Rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, changing landscapes. Successfully adapting to climate change
is growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using
our technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities
and better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes
involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs
along time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under
especially strong selective conditions, like those caused 
by rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution 
can happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes
to their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes
to an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much
an organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking
examples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry
forest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard,
rather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been
near impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly
less snowfall, but you'd still struggle 
to spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically
dominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage
in helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces
opportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing 
the battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs,
on the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive 
genetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes 
have rapidly evolved to take advantage 
of the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later 
and later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers
of melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely
to the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them
from overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted
to warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season
to protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe
are producing more repellent oils to protect themselves 
against the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group
of about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations
to rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover
more species evolving in response to climate change
out of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding
and precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species
will have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is
we already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making
on-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges 
are being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help
mobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas
are also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope. Fortunately, it's still within our power to preserve much of 
the wondrous biodiversity of this planet, which, after all, sustains us
in so many ways.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the options and wording are not identical, the intent and content of Question 8 align with the ground truth MCQ, which asks about how humans are helping wildlife adapt to climate change. Question 8 specifically mentions one way humans are helping to preserve biodiversity, which is by identifying and setting aside critical climate refuges. This is similar to option B in the ground truth MCQ, "Setting aside 'climate refuges' for protection." 

However, it's worth noting that a more similar generated MCQ would ideally include all the options mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (helping species move to better climates, setting aside climate refuges, and updating existing parks). Since none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, Question 8 is the closest approximation.

**Transcript**:
If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings, and decided to wage war on us, there's no doubt that humans
would lose. We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains
a million known species, and many others 
that haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down
to many things that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly, and can occur over and over again
in a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity. The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive in a range of environments
across the planet. Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor, protecting insects against
the outside world and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit
a small space and make use of all the available
resources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out
and get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share 
an ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched. We may have to accept 
that it's insects, not us, that are the true conquerors 
of the planet.

**Transcript**:
If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings, and decided to wage war on us, there's no doubt that humans
would lose. We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains
a million known species, and many others 
that haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down
to many things that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly, and can occur over and over again
in a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity. The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive in a range of environments
across the planet. Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor, protecting insects against
the outside world and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit
a small space and make use of all the available
resources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out
and get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share 
an ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched. We may have to accept 
that it's insects, not us, that are the true conquerors 
of the planet.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, some generated MCQs touch on the topic of insect adaptations and behaviors related to food sources.

The most similar generated MCQ would be Question 8: How do some insects, like wasps, ensure the survival of their offspring? Options: A. By laying their eggs in water, B. By paralyzing live insects and laying their eggs inside, C. By feeding them nectar from flowers, D. By building large balls out of animal dung.

Although this question does not directly ask about the kinds of foods insects eat, one of the options (B) mentions that wasps ensure the survival of their offspring by paralyzing live insects and laying their eggs inside, which implies that some insects eat other insects. Additionally, option C mentions feeding them nectar from flowers, which is another food source for some insects.

However, it's essential to note that this generated MCQ does not cover the full scope of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the various kinds of foods insects eat, including plants, blood, other insects, and feces.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it's Question 8, but with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
The term modern art sounds like it
means art that is popular at the moment, but in fact, modern art is a style
that originated over 150 years ago, and includes artists that by now
have attained classic status, such as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin. And what's even more ironic is that
the movement they pioneered, considered revolutionary
and even scandalous at the time, was inspired largely by an object
of a traditional and ancient design. As far back as the Renaissance, the primary European art movements
emphasized conventional representation and adherence to classical forms. But that began to change 
in the late 19th century as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne
expanded the boundaries of painting. Soon, a movement arose that sought
to create an entirely new style of art, and one way of doing so was to look
beyond Western civilization. For example, Paul Gauguin moved
to the island of Tahiti in the 1890s. There, he found inspiration in the island's
inhabitants, landscape, and culture to create artwork that intertwined
European themes and Polynesian lore. Others looked the cultures 
of the Islamic world, but the most influential inspiration
would come from Sub-Saharan Africa. As European empires expanded
deeper into the African continent, its artifacts and artworks made their way
into the hands of museums and collectors. One such collector was Henri Matisse, who showed his friend Picasso 
a mask he had acquired made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast. The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity, leading him to visit the Trocadéro 
Ethnographic Museum in Paris in 1907. Founded to house acquisitions 
from colonial conquests, the museum boasted 
a collection of African art, with stylized figures 
and masks made of wood and decorated with simple colors 
and materials. The visit was a revelation for Picasso, who proclaimed that African masks
were what painting was all about. At this time, Picasso had been working
on a painting of five nude women in a style that would later come
to be known as Cubism. And while three of these ladies
show facial features found in ancient Iberian art, a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage, the faces of the two on the right
closely resemble African masks. Created in 1907 after hundreds
of sketches and studies, "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" has been considered 
the first truly 20th century masterpiece, breaking with many previously 
held notions in art. It was at once aggressive and abstract, distorted yet primal in its raw geometry, a new artistic language with new forms,
colors, and meanings. And these avant-garde qualities
caused a sensation when the painting was first exhibited
almost ten years later. The public was shocked, critics denounced it as immoral, and even Picasso's own friends
were simultaneously surprised, offended, and mesmerized at his audacity. More artists soon followed 
in Picasso's footsteps. Constantin Brâncuși 
and Amedeo Modigliani in Paris, as well as the German Expressionists, all drew on the aesthetics 
of African sculptures in their work. Others looked to a different continent
for their inspiration. British sculptor Henry Moore based many
of his semi-abstract bronze sculptures on a replica of a chacmool, a distinctive reclining statue
from the Toltec-Maya culture. Pre-Columbian art was also a major
influence for Josef Albers. He created a series of compositions, such as the geometrical series
Homage to the Square, that were inspired by pyramids
and local art he encountered
on his frequent visits to Mexico. Inspiration from ancient cultures initiated one of the most revolutionary 
movements in art history, but were these artists playing the role
of explorers or conquistadors, appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive? Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards. Perhaps not too long from now, the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies, ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.

**Transcript**:
The term modern art sounds like it
means art that is popular at the moment, but in fact, modern art is a style
that originated over 150 years ago, and includes artists that by now
have attained classic status, such as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin. And what's even more ironic is that
the movement they pioneered, considered revolutionary
and even scandalous at the time, was inspired largely by an object
of a traditional and ancient design. As far back as the Renaissance, the primary European art movements
emphasized conventional representation and adherence to classical forms. But that began to change 
in the late 19th century as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne
expanded the boundaries of painting. Soon, a movement arose that sought
to create an entirely new style of art, and one way of doing so was to look
beyond Western civilization. For example, Paul Gauguin moved
to the island of Tahiti in the 1890s. There, he found inspiration in the island's
inhabitants, landscape, and culture to create artwork that intertwined
European themes and Polynesian lore. Others looked the cultures 
of the Islamic world, but the most influential inspiration
would come from Sub-Saharan Africa. As European empires expanded
deeper into the African continent, its artifacts and artworks made their way
into the hands of museums and collectors. One such collector was Henri Matisse, who showed his friend Picasso 
a mask he had acquired made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast. The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity, leading him to visit the Trocadéro 
Ethnographic Museum in Paris in 1907. Founded to house acquisitions 
from colonial conquests, the museum boasted 
a collection of African art, with stylized figures 
and masks made of wood and decorated with simple colors 
and materials. The visit was a revelation for Picasso, who proclaimed that African masks
were what painting was all about. At this time, Picasso had been working
on a painting of five nude women in a style that would later come
to be known as Cubism. And while three of these ladies
show facial features found in ancient Iberian art, a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage, the faces of the two on the right
closely resemble African masks. Created in 1907 after hundreds
of sketches and studies, "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" has been considered 
the first truly 20th century masterpiece, breaking with many previously 
held notions in art. It was at once aggressive and abstract, distorted yet primal in its raw geometry, a new artistic language with new forms,
colors, and meanings. And these avant-garde qualities
caused a sensation when the painting was first exhibited
almost ten years later. The public was shocked, critics denounced it as immoral, and even Picasso's own friends
were simultaneously surprised, offended, and mesmerized at his audacity. More artists soon followed 
in Picasso's footsteps. Constantin Brâncuși 
and Amedeo Modigliani in Paris, as well as the German Expressionists, all drew on the aesthetics 
of African sculptures in their work. Others looked to a different continent
for their inspiration. British sculptor Henry Moore based many
of his semi-abstract bronze sculptures on a replica of a chacmool, a distinctive reclining statue
from the Toltec-Maya culture. Pre-Columbian art was also a major
influence for Josef Albers. He created a series of compositions, such as the geometrical series
Homage to the Square, that were inspired by pyramids
and local art he encountered
on his frequent visits to Mexico. Inspiration from ancient cultures initiated one of the most revolutionary 
movements in art history, but were these artists playing the role
of explorers or conquistadors, appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive? Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards. Perhaps not too long from now, the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies, ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.

to make us procreate? Is it all we need? Do we need it at all? If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology
has discovered it yet. But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers
have put forward some intriguing theories. Love makes us whole, again. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love
in order to become complete. In his "Symposium",
he wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests 
with the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms,
four legs, and two faces. One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two. Since then, every person has been missing
half of him or herself. Love is the longing to find a soulmate
who'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed
a drunken comedian would say at a party. Love tricks us into having babies. Much, much later, German philosopher
Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love 
based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion. He suggested that we love because
our desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy,
but we are sorely mistaken. Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek
is consummated in our children. When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back 
into our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining
the species and perpetuating the cycle 
of human drudgery. Sounds like somebody needs a hug. Love is escape from our loneliness. According to the Nobel Prize-winning
British philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench
our physical and psychological desires. Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy 
of passionate love, sex is unsatisfying. Our fear of the cold, cruel world
tempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth
helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Love enriches our whole being,
making it the best thing in life. Love is a misleading affliction. Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha,
or the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting
arguments with Russell. Buddha proposed that we love because
we are trying to satisfy our base desires. Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love,
are a great source of suffering. Luckily, Buddha discovered 
the eight-fold path, a sort of program for 
extinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity,
wisdom, and compassion. The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated
this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in 
one of China's greatest classical novels, "Dream of the Red Chamber." In a subplot, Jia Rui 
falls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him. Conflicting emotions of love and hate
tear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror
that can cure him as long as he doesn't 
look at the front of it. But of course, 
he looks at the front of it. He sees Xi-feng. His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away 
in iron chains to die. Not all Buddhists think this way
about romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments
spell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors,
be avoided. Love lets us reach beyond ourselves. Let's end on a slightly 
more positive note. The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire
to integrate with another and that it infuses our lives
with meaning. However, she was less 
concerned with why we love and more interested 
in how we can love better. She saw that the problem
with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it
our only reason for being. Yet, dependence on another 
to justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games. To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised
loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other 
in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives
and the world together. Though we might never know
why we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be
an emotional rollercoaster ride. It's scary and exhilarating. It makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we lose ourselves. Maybe we find ourselves. It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be 
the best thing in life. Will you dare to find out?

**Transcript**:
Ah, romantic love - beautiful and intoxicating, heartbreaking and soul-crushing, often all at the same time. Why do we choose to put ourselves
through its emotional wringer? Does love make our lives meaningful, or is it an escape from our loneliness
and suffering? Is love a disguise for our sexual desire, or a trick of biology
to make us procreate? Is it all we need? Do we need it at all? If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology
has discovered it yet. But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers
have put forward some intriguing theories. Love makes us whole, again. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love
in order to become complete. In his "Symposium",
he wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests 
with the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms,
four legs, and two faces. One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two. Since then, every person has been missing
half of him or herself. Love is the longing to find a soulmate
who'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed
a drunken comedian would say at a party. Love tricks us into having babies. Much, much later, German philosopher
Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love 
based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion. He suggested that we love because
our desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy,
but we are sorely mistaken. Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek
is consummated in our children. When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back 
into our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining
the species and perpetuating the cycle 
of human drudgery. Sounds like somebody needs a hug. Love is escape from our loneliness. According to the Nobel Prize-winning
British philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench
our physical and psychological desires. Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy 
of passionate love, sex is unsatisfying. Our fear of the cold, cruel world
tempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth
helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Love enriches our whole being,
making it the best thing in life. Love is a misleading affliction. Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha,
or the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting
arguments with Russell. Buddha proposed that we love because
we are trying to satisfy our base desires. Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love,
are a great source of suffering. Luckily, Buddha discovered 
the eight-fold path, a sort of program for 
extinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity,
wisdom, and compassion. The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated
this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in 
one of China's greatest classical novels, "Dream of the Red Chamber." In a subplot, Jia Rui 
falls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him. Conflicting emotions of love and hate
tear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror
that can cure him as long as he doesn't 
look at the front of it. But of course, 
he looks at the front of it. He sees Xi-feng. His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away 
in iron chains to die. Not all Buddhists think this way
about romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments
spell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors,
be avoided. Love lets us reach beyond ourselves. Let's end on a slightly 
more positive note. The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire
to integrate with another and that it infuses our lives
with meaning. However, she was less 
concerned with why we love and more interested 
in how we can love better. She saw that the problem
with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it
our only reason for being. Yet, dependence on another 
to justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games. To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised
loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other 
in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives
and the world together. Though we might never know
why we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be
an emotional rollercoaster ride. It's scary and exhilarating. It makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we lose ourselves. Maybe we find ourselves. It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be 
the best thing in life. Will you dare to find out?

- When you get to space, because you're in a zero G environment, some really funky things
happen to your body. (upbeat music) I grew an inch. Right now, I'm 5'11" but in
space I was six-feet tall. On the ground, gravity
compresses your spine, it pulls you down, the
force factor going down. In space, without gravity
pulling your spine down, every vertebrae has a chance to move up, which gives you your extra inch of height. After my spine elongated, when I went to bed on the first night, I felt some back pain,
some lower back pain, and so I actually curled up to
kind of alleviate that pain, to kind of stretch it out even more. A few other ways the
body can change in space are the heart gets
smaller and changes shape because it's not having to pump
as hard to pull the blood up from your feet, 'cause now things are
just floating and working inside your body so it's pumping easier, therefore the muscle walls
actually changes the shape and they get smaller. Without gravity, your
bones, they change shape and they lose calcium, and
they become more brittle. So, we run on a treadmill that
you strap yourself down to and you run on the treadmill
to actually give loads into your bones to keep
them from atrophying and losing bone density or calcium. For some people in space,
your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you
to wear glasses in space, so it effects your vision. So, we keep different

**Transcript**:
- When you get to space, because you're in a zero G environment, some really funky things
happen to your body. (upbeat music) I grew an inch. Right now, I'm 5'11" but in
space I was six-feet tall. On the ground, gravity
compresses your spine, it pulls you down, the
force factor going down. In space, without gravity
pulling your spine down, every vertebrae has a chance to move up, which gives you your extra inch of height. After my spine elongated, when I went to bed on the first night, I felt some back pain,
some lower back pain, and so I actually curled up to
kind of alleviate that pain, to kind of stretch it out even more. A few other ways the
body can change in space are the heart gets
smaller and changes shape because it's not having to pump
as hard to pull the blood up from your feet, 'cause now things are
just floating and working inside your body so it's pumping easier, therefore the muscle walls
actually changes the shape and they get smaller. Without gravity, your
bones, they change shape and they lose calcium, and
they become more brittle. So, we run on a treadmill that
you strap yourself down to and you run on the treadmill
to actually give loads into your bones to keep
them from atrophying and losing bone density or calcium. For some people in space,
your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you
to wear glasses in space, so it effects your vision. So, we keep different
prescriptions of glasses on board just in case
someone's vision changes. Any changes in our bodies and anything that happens in space, it's worth it for the
spirit of exploration.

**Transcript**:
- When you get to space, because you're in a zero G environment, some really funky things
happen to your body. (upbeat music) I grew an inch. Right now, I'm 5'11" but in
space I was six-feet tall. On the ground, gravity
compresses your spine, it pulls you down, the
force factor going down. In space, without gravity
pulling your spine down, every vertebrae has a chance to move up, which gives you your extra inch of height. After my spine elongated, when I went to bed on the first night, I felt some back pain,
some lower back pain, and so I actually curled up to
kind of alleviate that pain, to kind of stretch it out even more. A few other ways the
body can change in space are the heart gets
smaller and changes shape because it's not having to pump
as hard to pull the blood up from your feet, 'cause now things are
just floating and working inside your body so it's pumping easier, therefore the muscle walls
actually changes the shape and they get smaller. Without gravity, your
bones, they change shape and they lose calcium, and
they become more brittle. So, we run on a treadmill that
you strap yourself down to and you run on the treadmill
to actually give loads into your bones to keep
them from atrophying and losing bone density or calcium. For some people in space,
your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you
to wear glasses in space, so it effects your vision. So, we keep different
prescriptions of glasses on board just in case
someone's vision changes. Any changes in our bodies and anything that happens in space, it's worth it for the
spirit of exploration.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: 5. Some people have to wear glasses while in space, but not on Earth. Why?
Options: A. The light decreases and glasses help them see better., B. Intercranial pressure decreases., C. Their eyeballs change shape., D. It keeps their eyeballs from crossing.

**Transcript**:
After the French Revolution 
erupted in 1789, Europe was thrown into chaos. Neighboring countries' monarchs feared
they would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust
between factions lead to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged 
to take charge of France. But did he save the revolution
or destroy it? "Order, order, who's the defendant today?
I don't see anyone." "Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded 
nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal 
stature-based insecurities." "Actually, Napoléon was 
at least average height for his time. The idea that he was short comes
only from British wartime propaganda. And he was no tyrant. He was safeguarding the young Republic
from being crushed by the European monarchies." "By overthrowing its government
and seizing power himself?" "Your Honor, as a young and successful
military officer, Napoléon fully supported 
the French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. But the revolutionaries were incapable
of real leadership. Robespierre and the Jacobins
who first came to power unleashed a reign of terror
on the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone
who disagreed with them. And The Directory that replaced them
was an unstable and incompetent oligarchy. They needed a strong leader who could
govern wisely and justly." "So, France went through 
that whole revolution just to end up with 
another all-powerful ruler?" "Not quite. Napoléon's new powers were derived
from the constitution that was approved by a popular vote
in the Consulate." "Ha! The constitution was practically dictated
at gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired 
of constant civil war." "Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution
and a legal code that kept some of the most important
achievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men." "All men, indeed. He deprived women of the rights
that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery
in the French colonies. Haiti is still recovering from 
the consequences centuries later. What kind of equality is that?" "The only kind that could be stably
maintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors." "Speaking of neighbors, what was with
all the invasions?" "Great question, Your Honor." "Which invasions are we talking about? It was the neighboring empires
who had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty
across Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge. Having defended France as a soldier
and a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense
is a good offense." "An offense against the entire continent? Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized
the new French Regime. But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless 
he had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting. He tried to enforce a European-wide
blockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars 
to hold onto his gains. And what was the result? Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole 
international order shattered." "You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic 
and liberal ideals across Europe. It was thanks to Napoléon that
the continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented
feudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, 
and secular nation states where the people held more power
and rights than ever before." "Should we also thank him
for the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes? You can see how well that turned out
a century later." "So what would European history have been
like if it weren't for Napoléon?" "Unimaginably better/worse." Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum
would die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army. But even after being deposed
and exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching
a bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second
and final time. Bonaparte was 
a ruler full of contradictions, defending a popular revolution
by imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals
through imperial wars, and though he never achieved his dream
of conquering Europe, he undoubtedly left his mark on it,
for better or for worse.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: Why did Napoléon invade other European countries, according to his defender?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks why neighboring countries attacked France, while Question 7 asks why Napoléon invaded other European countries. However, the transcript suggests that Napoléon's invasions were a response to the European monarchies' attacks on France, so the two questions are related.

The other generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ as closely, either because they ask about different topics or because their options do not align with the ground truth MCQ's options.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

**7**

However, please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the reasons behind the neighboring countries' attack on France.

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ:

**Question: Why did neighboring countries attack France following the 1789 revolution?**
**Options: A. To resolve outstanding border disputes, B. As part of a holy war, C. To stop the revolution from spreading beyond France, D. To establish a European-wide blockade of Britain**

This new generated MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
After the French Revolution 
erupted in 1789, Europe was thrown into chaos. Neighboring countries' monarchs feared
they would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust
between factions lead to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged 
to take charge of France. But did he save the revolution
or destroy it? "Order, order, who's the defendant today?
I don't see anyone." "Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded 
nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal 
stature-based insecurities." "Actually, Napoléon was 
at least average height for his time. The idea that he was short comes
only from British wartime propaganda. And he was no tyrant. He was safeguarding the young Republic
from being crushed by the European monarchies." "By overthrowing its government
and seizing power himself?" "Your Honor, as a young and successful
military officer, Napoléon fully supported 
the French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. But the revolutionaries were incapable
of real leadership. Robespierre and the Jacobins
who first came to power unleashed a reign of terror
on the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone
who disagreed with them. And The Directory that replaced them
was an unstable and incompetent oligarchy. They needed a strong leader who could
govern wisely and justly." "So, France went through 
that whole revolution just to end up with 
another all-powerful ruler?" "Not quite. Napoléon's new powers were derived
from the constitution that was approved by a popular vote
in the Consulate." "Ha! The constitution was practically dictated
at gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired 
of constant civil war." "Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution
and a legal code that kept some of the most important
achievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men." "All men, indeed. He deprived women of the rights
that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery
in the French colonies. Haiti is still recovering from 
the consequences centuries later. What kind of equality is that?" "The only kind that could be stably
maintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors." "Speaking of neighbors, what was with
all the invasions?" "Great question, Your Honor." "Which invasions are we talking about? It was the neighboring empires
who had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty
across Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge. Having defended France as a soldier
and a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense
is a good offense." "An offense against the entire continent? Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized
the new French Regime. But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless 
he had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting. He tried to enforce a European-wide
blockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars 
to hold onto his gains. And what was the result? Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole 
international order shattered." "You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic 
and liberal ideals across Europe. It was thanks to Napoléon that
the continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented
feudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, 
and secular nation states where the people held more power
and rights than ever before." "Should we also thank him
for the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes? You can see how well that turned out
a century later." "So what would European history have been
like if it weren't for Napoléon?" "Unimaginably better/worse." Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum
would die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army. But even after being deposed
and exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching
a bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second
and final time. Bonaparte was 
a ruler full of contradictions, defending a popular revolution
by imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals
through imperial wars, and though he never achieved his dream
of conquering Europe, he undoubtedly left his mark on it,
for better or for worse.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a legacy NOT attributed to Napoleon, and the correct option is "Diplomatic resolution of international conflicts." Question 8 asks about a result of Napoleon's conquests, and while it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, option C "The establishment of a lasting peace in Europe" is similar in intent to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ. However, it's not a perfect match.

A more suitable match can be found in the fact that Question 8 has an option that mentions a negative consequence (rise of nationalism and increase in army sizes), and another option that mentions a positive consequence (spread of democratic and liberal ideals). This contrast of positive and negative consequences is similar to the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about a legacy NOT attributed to Napoleon.

However, another generated MCQ is even more similar. Question 5 asks about an achievement of the French Revolution that Napoleon's new constitution and legal code kept intact. Option C mentions "The establishment of equality before the law for all men." However, the ground truth MCQ is about a legacy NOT attributed to Napoleon.

Considering the options provided in the generated MCQs, none directly asks about a legacy NOT attributed to Napoleon. However, one question has options that can be linked to the spread of liberal ideals and the rise of nationalism, both of which can be considered legacies of Napoleon.

But looking at the generated MCQs again, Question 10 asks about a contradictory aspect of Napoleon's rule. While it does not directly ask about a legacy, the options provided do give insight into Napoleon's actions and their consequences. However, one question that does relate to the legacies attributed to Napoleon is Question 8.

Upon closer inspection, it appears that Question 8 is still not the most suitable match.

However, I noticed that I missed one aspect of the generated MCQs. Looking at the questions again, I see that one question is indeed related to the legacy of Napoleon.

I realized that I made an error in my previous responses. The correct answer is indeed related to the legacy of Napoleon, but none of the questions directly asks about a legacy NOT attributed to him.

However, I must choose the most similar question. In that case, I will choose Question 8, but I want to clarify that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Where does bread get its fluffiness? Swiss cheese its holes? And what makes vinegar so sour? These foods may taste 
completely different, but all of these phenomena come from
tiny organisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts. Let's start with yeast. Yeast are single-celled fungi 
used to make bread, beer, and wine, among other products. Yeast break down carbohydrates,
like sugar, to get energy 
and the molecules they need to function. They have two different ways to do this: the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway, and the oxygen-independent, 
anaerobic pathway, which is also called fermentation. When you bake bread,
yeast can use both pathways, but they normally prefer to start with
the anaerobic process of fermentation. In this process, ethanol is produced
in addition to CO2. No, bread isn't alcoholic. Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted
evaporate during baking. In the aerobic, 
or oxygen-dependent pathway, the yeast consume some of the sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2, and water. In both processes, the CO2 accumulates
and creates tiny bubbles. These bubbles get trapped by gluten
and create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture. Wine also relies on yeast. But a wine-making set-up 
keeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar 
using fermentation, the anaerobic pathway. The process often starts with wild yeasts
already hanging out on the grapes. But to get consistent results, most winemakers also add 
carefully selected strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol. The yeast consume the sugar
in the grape juice, and as the sugar level drops, the alcohol level rises. This doesn't necessarily mean 
that sweeter wines have less alcohol. Different types of grapes start with
different amounts of sugar, and sugar can also be added. What happens to the carbon dioxide? It just bubbles away through a vent. In carbonated alcoholic beverages,
like champagne and beer, sealed containers are used in primary
or secondary fermentation to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle. Wine also introduces us to our second
type of food-producing microorganism: bacteria. A special strain of bacteria turns a tart compound in grape juice
into softer tasting ones that are responsible for some of
the flavors in red wines and chardonnays. Another type of bacteria,
called acetic acid bacteria, isn't so desirable in wine, but they have their function, too. If there's oxygen around, these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine
into, well, acetic acid. Let this process continue
and you'll eventually get vinegar. Bacteria are the key for cheese, too. To make cheese, 
milk is inoculated with bacteria. The bacteria gobble up the lactose,
a kind of sugar, and produce lactic acid,
along with many other chemicals. As the milk gets more and more acidic, its proteins start to aggregate 
and curdle. That's why spoiled milk is clumpy. Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme
called rennet, naturally found inside of cows, goats,
and some other mammals to help this process along. Eventually, those little curdles turn into
bigger curds, which are pressed 
to squeeze out the water, and create a firm cheese. Different strains of bacteria
make different kinds of cheese. For example, a species of bacteria
that emits carbon dioxide is what gives swiss cheese
its characteristic holes. Some cheeses, brie and camembert,
use another kind of microorganism, too: mold. So your kitchen functions as a sort of
biotechnology lab manned by microorganisms 
that culture your cuisine. Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, 
cheddar, challah, pita, and naan. But maybe not all at the same dinner.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not directly ask about yeast not being used, it does ask about the characteristic holes in Swiss cheese, which is related to the fact that yeast is not being used in Swiss cheese production, as stated in the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in Question 8 (A. A species of bacteria that emits carbon dioxide) also implies that yeast is not responsible for the holes in Swiss cheese, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Where does bread get its fluffiness? Swiss cheese its holes? And what makes vinegar so sour? These foods may taste 
completely different, but all of these phenomena come from
tiny organisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts. Let's start with yeast. Yeast are single-celled fungi 
used to make bread, beer, and wine, among other products. Yeast break down carbohydrates,
like sugar, to get energy 
and the molecules they need to function. They have two different ways to do this: the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway, and the oxygen-independent, 
anaerobic pathway, which is also called fermentation. When you bake bread,
yeast can use both pathways, but they normally prefer to start with
the anaerobic process of fermentation. In this process, ethanol is produced
in addition to CO2. No, bread isn't alcoholic. Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted
evaporate during baking. In the aerobic, 
or oxygen-dependent pathway, the yeast consume some of the sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2, and water. In both processes, the CO2 accumulates
and creates tiny bubbles. These bubbles get trapped by gluten
and create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture. Wine also relies on yeast. But a wine-making set-up 
keeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar 
using fermentation, the anaerobic pathway. The process often starts with wild yeasts
already hanging out on the grapes. But to get consistent results, most winemakers also add 
carefully selected strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol. The yeast consume the sugar
in the grape juice, and as the sugar level drops, the alcohol level rises. This doesn't necessarily mean 
that sweeter wines have less alcohol. Different types of grapes start with
different amounts of sugar, and sugar can also be added. What happens to the carbon dioxide? It just bubbles away through a vent. In carbonated alcoholic beverages,
like champagne and beer, sealed containers are used in primary
or secondary fermentation to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle. Wine also introduces us to our second
type of food-producing microorganism: bacteria. A special strain of bacteria turns a tart compound in grape juice
into softer tasting ones that are responsible for some of
the flavors in red wines and chardonnays. Another type of bacteria,
called acetic acid bacteria, isn't so desirable in wine, but they have their function, too. If there's oxygen around, these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine
into, well, acetic acid. Let this process continue
and you'll eventually get vinegar. Bacteria are the key for cheese, too. To make cheese, 
milk is inoculated with bacteria. The bacteria gobble up the lactose,
a kind of sugar, and produce lactic acid,
along with many other chemicals. As the milk gets more and more acidic, its proteins start to aggregate 
and curdle. That's why spoiled milk is clumpy. Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme
called rennet, naturally found inside of cows, goats,
and some other mammals to help this process along. Eventually, those little curdles turn into
bigger curds, which are pressed 
to squeeze out the water, and create a firm cheese. Different strains of bacteria
make different kinds of cheese. For example, a species of bacteria
that emits carbon dioxide is what gives swiss cheese
its characteristic holes. Some cheeses, brie and camembert,
use another kind of microorganism, too: mold. So your kitchen functions as a sort of
biotechnology lab manned by microorganisms 
that culture your cuisine. Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, 
cheddar, challah, pita, and naan. But maybe not all at the same dinner.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of its relevance to biotechnological applications.

The ground truth MCQ asks why the food types described in the video are considered biotechnological applications. The correct option is that they are products made using biological processes.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 comes closest to this topic, as it asks about the role of tiny organisms in producing food. However, it does not directly address the concept of biotechnological applications.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ. Instead, I suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the concept of biotechnological applications, such as:

Question: Why are foods like bread, cheese, and wine considered examples of biotechnology?
Options: A. They are made using advanced machinery, B. They are products made using biological processes, C. They are created using chemical reactions, D. They are not examples of biotechnology

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people
who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution. The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries. Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries. They are commonly referred to as refugees. But what exactly does that term mean? The world has known refugees 
for millennia, but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War. It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality, and is unable to return 
to their home country because of well-founded fears
of being persecuted. That persecution may be due to their race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion, and is often related to war and violence. Today, roughly half the world's refugees
are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation. Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes. But before we get 
to what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up. There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee." "Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution, such as searching 
for better economic opportunities or leaving drought-stricken areas
in search of better circumstances. There are many people around the world
who have been displaced because of natural disasters, food insecurities, and other hardships, but international law, rightly or wrongly, only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees. So what happens when someone
flees their country? Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous with limited access to shelter,
water, or food. Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries. Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling by standard routes. This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers to help them cross borders. Whereas some people seek safety
with their families, others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later. This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long. While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments. Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country. But resettlement and long-term 
integration options are often limited. So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades. Once in a new country, the first legal
step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum. At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted. While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee. Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially. Host countries have several duties towards people they have 
recognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and non-discrimination. The most basic obligation towards refugees
is non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened. In reality, however, refugees are
frequently the victims of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment. They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism. And all too often, they aren't permitted
to enter the work force and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid. In addition, far too many refugee children
are out of school due to lack of funding 
for education programs. If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that
at a certain point, your ancestors were forced 
from their homes, either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution. It would be good of us to remember
their stories when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced, searching for a new home.

**Transcript**:
Around the globe, there are approximately 60 million people
who have been forced to leave their homes to escape war, violence, and persecution. The majority of them have become
internally displaced persons, which means they have fled their homes
but are still within their own countries. Others have crossed a border and sought
shelter outside of their own countries. They are commonly referred to as refugees. But what exactly does that term mean? The world has known refugees 
for millennia, but the modern definition was drafted
in the UN's 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees in response to mass persecutions
and displacements of the Second World War. It defines a refugee as someone who is
outside their country of nationality, and is unable to return 
to their home country because of well-founded fears
of being persecuted. That persecution may be due to their race,
religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group,
or political opinion, and is often related to war and violence. Today, roughly half the world's refugees
are children, some of them unaccompanied by an adult, a situation that makes them especially
vulnerable to child labor or sexual exploitation. Each refugee's story is different, and many must undergo dangerous
journeys with uncertain outcomes. But before we get 
to what their journeys involve, let's clear one thing up. There's a lot of confusion regarding
the difference between the terms "migrant" and "refugee." "Migrants" usually refers to people 
who leave their country for reasons not related to persecution, such as searching 
for better economic opportunities or leaving drought-stricken areas
in search of better circumstances. There are many people around the world
who have been displaced because of natural disasters, food insecurities, and other hardships, but international law, rightly or wrongly, only recognizes those fleeing
conflict and violence as refugees. So what happens when someone
flees their country? Most refugee journeys 
are long and perilous with limited access to shelter,
water, or food. Since the departure can be sudden
and unexpected, belongings might be left behind, and people who are evading conflict
often do not have the required documents, like visas, to board airplanes
and legally enter other countries. Financial and political factors can also
prevent them from traveling by standard routes. This means they can usually only travel
by land or sea, and may need to entrust their lives
to smugglers to help them cross borders. Whereas some people seek safety
with their families, others attempt passage alone
and leave their loved ones behind with the hopes of being reunited later. This separation can be traumatic
and unbearably long. While more than half the world's refugees
are in cities, sometimes the first stop for a person
fleeing conflict is a refugee camp, usually run by the United Nations
Refugee Agency or local governments. Refugee camps are intended 
to be temporary structures, offering short-term shelter until 
inhabitants can safely return home, be integrated to the host country, or resettle in another country. But resettlement and long-term 
integration options are often limited. So many refugees are left with no choice
but to remain in camps for years and sometimes even decades. Once in a new country, the first legal
step for a displaced person is to apply for asylum. At this point, they are an asylum seeker and not officially recognized as a refugee
until the application has been accepted. While countries by and large agree
on one definition of refugee, every host country is responsible
for examining all requests for asylum and deciding whether applicants can be
granted the status of refugee. Different countries guidelines 
can vary substantially. Host countries have several duties towards people they have 
recognized as refugees, like the guarantee of a minimum standard
of treatment and non-discrimination. The most basic obligation towards refugees
is non-refoulement, a principle preventing a nation from
sending an individual to a country where their life and freedom
are threatened. In reality, however, refugees are
frequently the victims of inconsistent 
and discriminatory treatment. They're increasingly obliged to rebuild
their lives in the face of xenophobia and racism. And all too often, they aren't permitted
to enter the work force and are fully dependent 
on humanitarian aid. In addition, far too many refugee children
are out of school due to lack of funding 
for education programs. If you go back in your own family history, chances are you will discover that
at a certain point, your ancestors were forced 
from their homes, either escaping a war
or fleeing discrimination and persecution. It would be good of us to remember
their stories when we hear of refugees 
currently displaced, searching for a new home.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What makes a book a book? Is it just anything that stores
and communicates information? Or does it have to do with paper, binding, font, ink,
its weight in your hands, the smell of the pages? Is this a book? Probably not. But is this? To answer these questions, we need to go back to the start
of the book as we know it and understand how these elements
came together to make something more than the sum of their parts. The earliest object that we think
of as a book is the codex: a stack of pages bound along one edge. But the real turning point in book history was Johannes Gutenberg's
printing press in the mid-15th century. The concept of moveable type had been
invented much earlier in Eastern culture, but the introduction of Gutenberg's
press had a profound effect. Suddenly, an elite class of monks
and the ruling class no longer controlled 
the production of texts. Messages could spread more easily, and copies could constantly be produced, so printing houses popped
up all over Europe. The product of this bibliographic boom
is familiar to us in some respects, but markedly different in others. The skeleton of the book is paper,
type, and cover. More than 2,000 years ago,
China invented paper as a writing surface, which was itself predated 
by Egyptian papyrus. However, until the 16th century, Europeans mainly wrote 
on thin sheets of wood and durable parchment
made of stretched animal skins. Eventually, the popularity of paper
spread throughout Europe, replacing parchment for most printings
because it was less expensive in bulk. Inks had been made by combining
organic plant and animal dyes with water or wine, but since water doesn't stick
to metal type, use of the printing press required
a change to oil-based ink. Printers used black ink made of
a mixture of lamp soot, turpentine, and walnut oil. And what about font size and type? The earliest movable type pieces
consisted of reversed letters cast in relief on the ends
of lead alloy stocks. They were handmade and expensive, and the designs were as different
as the people who carved their molds. Standardization was not really possible
until mass manufacturing and the creation of an accessible
word processing system. As for style, we can thank Nicolas Jenson
for developing two types of Roman font that led to thousands of others, including the familiar Times Roman. Something had to hold all this together, and until the late 15th century, covers consisted of either wood, or sheets of paper pasted together. These would eventually be replaced
by rope fiber millboard, originally intended for high quality
bindings in the late 17th century, but later as a less expensive option. And while today's mass produced
cover illustrations are marketing tools, the cover designs of early books 
were made to order. Even spines have a history. Initially, they were not considered
aesthetically important, and the earliest ones were flat,
rather than rounded. The flat form made the books
easier to read by allowing the book to rest easily
on a table. But those spines were damaged
easily from the stresses of normal use. A rounded form solved that issue, although new problems arose, like having the book close
in on itself. But flexibility was more important, especially for the on-the-go reader. As the book evolves
and we replace bound texts with flat screens and electronic ink, are these objects and files really books? Does the feel of the cover or the smell of the paper add something
crucial to the experience? Or does the magic live only
within the words, no matter what their presentation?

**Transcript**:
As we walk through our daily environments, we're surrounded by exotic creatures that are too small to see 
with the naked eye. We usually imagine these 
microscopic organisms, or microbes, as asocial cells that float around
by themselves. But in reality, 
microbes gather by the millions to form vast communities 
known as biofilms. Natural biofilms are like 
miniature jungles filled with many kinds of microbes
from across the web of life. Bacteria and archaea mingle with
other microbes like algae, fungi, and protozoa, forming dense, organized structures
that grow on almost any surface. When you pad across a river bottom, touch the rind of an aged cheese, tend your garden soil, or brush your teeth, you're coming into contact with these
invisible ecosystems. To see how biofilms come about, let's watch one as it develops
on a submerged river rock. This type of biofilm might begin
with a few bacteria swimming through their liquid environment. The cells use rotating flagella
to propel towards the surface of the rock, which they attach to with the help
of sticky appendages. Then, they start producing an
extracellular matrix that holds them together as they divide
and reproduce. Before long, microcolonies arise, clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,
glue-like material. Microcolonies grow to become towers, while water channels flow around them, functioning like a basic 
circulatory system. But why do microbes build 
such complex communities when they could live alone? For one thing, microbes 
living in a biofilm are rooted in a relatively 
stable microenvironment where they may have access 
to a nutrient source. There's also safety in numbers. Out in the deep, dark wilderness
of the microbial world, isolated microbes face serious risks. Predators want to eat them, immune systems seek to destroy them, and there are physical dangers, too, like running out of water
and drying up. However, in a biofilm, 
the extracellular matrix shields microbes from external threats. Biofilms also enable interactions
between individual cells. When microbes are packed against 
each other in close proximity, they can communicate, exchange genetic information, and engage in cooperative
and competitive social behaviors. Take the soil in your garden, home to thousands of bacterial species. As one species colonizes a plant root, its individual cells might differentiate
into various subpopulations, each carrying out a specific task. Matrix producers pump out 
the extracellular goo, swimmers assemble flagella
and are free to move about or migrate, and spore-formers produce dormant,
tough endospores that survive starvation, temperature extremes, and harmful radiation. This phenomenon is called 
division of labor. Ultimately, it gives rise to 
a sophisticated system of cooperation that's somewhat like 
a multicellular organism in itself. But because biofilms often contain
many different microbes that aren't closely related to each other, interactions can also be competitive. Bacteria launch vicious attacks 
on their competitors by secreting chemicals 
into the environment, or by deploying molecular spears
to inject nearby cells with toxins that literally blow them up. In the end, competition 
is all about resources. If one species eliminates another, it keeps more space and food for itself. Although this dramatic life cycle
occurs beyond the limits of our vision, microbial communities provide humans
and other species with tangible, and sometimes even delicious, benefits. Microbes make up a major fraction
of the biomass on Earth and play a critical role 
within the global ecosystem that supports all larger organisms, including us. They produce much of the oxygen we breath, and are recruited to clean up
environmental pollution, like oil spills, or to treat our waste water. Not to mention, biofilms are normal
and flavor enhancing parts of many of the foods we enjoy, including cheese, salami, and kombucha. So the next time you brush your teeth, bite into that cheese rind, sift through garden soil, or skip a river stone, look as close as you can. Imagine the microbial jungles 
all around you waiting to be discovered and explored.

into various subpopulations, each carrying out a specific task. Matrix producers pump out 
the extracellular goo, swimmers assemble flagella
and are free to move about or migrate, and spore-formers produce dormant,
tough endospores that survive starvation, temperature extremes, and harmful radiation. This phenomenon is called 
division of labor. Ultimately, it gives rise to 
a sophisticated system of cooperation that's somewhat like 
a multicellular organism in itself. But because biofilms often contain
many different microbes that aren't closely related to each other, interactions can also be competitive. Bacteria launch vicious attacks 
on their competitors by secreting chemicals 
into the environment, or by deploying molecular spears
to inject nearby cells with toxins that literally blow them up. In the end, competition 
is all about resources. If one species eliminates another, it keeps more space and food for itself. Although this dramatic life cycle
occurs beyond the limits of our vision, microbial communities provide humans
and other species with tangible, and sometimes even delicious, benefits. Microbes make up a major fraction
of the biomass on Earth and play a critical role 
within the global ecosystem that supports all larger organisms, including us. They produce much of the oxygen we breath, and are recruited to clean up
environmental pollution, like oil spills, or to treat our waste water. Not to mention, biofilms are normal
and flavor enhancing parts of many of the foods we enjoy, including cheese, salami, and kombucha. So the next time you brush your teeth, bite into that cheese rind, sift through garden soil, or skip a river stone, look as close as you can. Imagine the microbial jungles 
all around you waiting to be discovered and explored.

**Transcript**:
As we walk through our daily environments, we're surrounded by exotic creatures that are too small to see 
with the naked eye. We usually imagine these 
microscopic organisms, or microbes, as asocial cells that float around
by themselves. But in reality, 
microbes gather by the millions to form vast communities 
known as biofilms. Natural biofilms are like 
miniature jungles filled with many kinds of microbes
from across the web of life. Bacteria and archaea mingle with
other microbes like algae, fungi, and protozoa, forming dense, organized structures
that grow on almost any surface. When you pad across a river bottom, touch the rind of an aged cheese, tend your garden soil, or brush your teeth, you're coming into contact with these
invisible ecosystems. To see how biofilms come about, let's watch one as it develops
on a submerged river rock. This type of biofilm might begin
with a few bacteria swimming through their liquid environment. The cells use rotating flagella
to propel towards the surface of the rock, which they attach to with the help
of sticky appendages. Then, they start producing an
extracellular matrix that holds them together as they divide
and reproduce. Before long, microcolonies arise, clusters of cells sheathed in this slimy,
glue-like material. Microcolonies grow to become towers, while water channels flow around them, functioning like a basic 
circulatory system. But why do microbes build 
such complex communities when they could live alone? For one thing, microbes 
living in a biofilm are rooted in a relatively 
stable microenvironment where they may have access 
to a nutrient source. There's also safety in numbers. Out in the deep, dark wilderness
of the microbial world, isolated microbes face serious risks. Predators want to eat them, immune systems seek to destroy them, and there are physical dangers, too, like running out of water
and drying up. However, in a biofilm, 
the extracellular matrix shields microbes from external threats. Biofilms also enable interactions
between individual cells. When microbes are packed against 
each other in close proximity, they can communicate, exchange genetic information, and engage in cooperative
and competitive social behaviors. Take the soil in your garden, home to thousands of bacterial species. As one species colonizes a plant root, its individual cells might differentiate
into various subpopulations, each carrying out a specific task. Matrix producers pump out

**Transcript**:
When it was ratified in 1789, the U.S. Constitution didn't just
institute a government by the people. It provided a way for the people to alter
the constitution itself. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments
proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. So what is it that makes the Constitution
so hard to change? In short, its creators. The founders of the United States
were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies, which needed assurance that their 
agreements couldn't be easily undone. So here's what they decided. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive 
a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress, or a request from two-thirds 
of state legislatures to call a national convention, and that's just the first step. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified
by three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have
its legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate 
ratification convention with delegates elected by voters. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, 
the American Constitution is quite static. Most other democracies pass amendments
every couple of years. The U.S., on the other hand, 
hasn't passed one since 1992. At this point, you may wonder how any
amendments managed to pass at all. The first ten, 
known as the Bill of Rights, includes some of America's 
most well-known freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. These were passed all at once to resolve some conflicts from 
the original Constitutional Convention. Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment,
which abolished slavery, as well as the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments, only passed after a bloody civil war. Ratifying amendments 
has also become harder as the country has grown larger
and more diverse. The first ever proposed amendment, a formula to assign 
congressional representatives, was on the verge of ratification
in the 1790s. However, as more and more states
joined the union, the number needed to reach 
the three-quarter mark increased as well, leaving it unratified to this day. Today, there are many 
suggested amendments, including outlawing 
the burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support,
their likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically
polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach
a broad consensus. In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's
representative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total
population to block an amendment. Of course, the simplest solution would be
to make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the thresholds required
for proposal and ratification. That, however, would require 
its own amendment. Instead, historical progress has mainly
come from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has expanded its interpretation
of existing constitutional laws to keep up with the times. Considering that Supreme Court justices
are unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from 
the most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves
may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote 
that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed
or repealed since every political process 
is full of obstacles that distort the will of the people. Although he believed that the basic principles 
of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs
to the living, and not to the dead.

**Transcript**:
When it was ratified in 1789, the U.S. Constitution didn't just
institute a government by the people. It provided a way for the people to alter
the constitution itself. And yet, of the nearly 11,000 amendments
proposed in the centuries since, only 27 have succeeded as of 2016. So what is it that makes the Constitution
so hard to change? In short, its creators. The founders of the United States
were trying to create a unified country from thirteen different colonies, which needed assurance that their 
agreements couldn't be easily undone. So here's what they decided. For an amendment to even be proposed, it must receive 
a two-thirds vote of approval in both houses of Congress, or a request from two-thirds 
of state legislatures to call a national convention, and that's just the first step. To actually change the Constitution, the amendment must be ratified
by three-quarters of all states. To do this, each state can either have
its legislature vote on the amendment, or it can hold a separate 
ratification convention with delegates elected by voters. The result of such high thresholds is that, today, 
the American Constitution is quite static. Most other democracies pass amendments
every couple of years. The U.S., on the other hand, 
hasn't passed one since 1992. At this point, you may wonder how any
amendments managed to pass at all. The first ten, 
known as the Bill of Rights, includes some of America's 
most well-known freedoms, such as the freedom of speech, and the right to a fair trial. These were passed all at once to resolve some conflicts from 
the original Constitutional Convention. Years later, the Thirteenth Amendment,
which abolished slavery, as well as the Fourteenth 
and Fifteenth Amendments, only passed after a bloody civil war. Ratifying amendments 
has also become harder as the country has grown larger
and more diverse. The first ever proposed amendment, a formula to assign 
congressional representatives, was on the verge of ratification
in the 1790s. However, as more and more states
joined the union, the number needed to reach 
the three-quarter mark increased as well, leaving it unratified to this day. Today, there are many 
suggested amendments, including outlawing 
the burning of the flag, limiting congressional terms, or even repealing the Second Amendment. While many enjoy strong support,
their likelihood of passing is slim. Americans today are the most politically
polarized since the Civil War, making it nearly impossible to reach
a broad consensus. In fact, the late Supreme Court Justice
Antonin Scalia once calculated that due to America's
representative system of government, it could take as little as 2% of the total
population to block an amendment. Of course, the simplest solution would be
to make the Constitution easier to amend by lowering the thresholds required
for proposal and ratification. That, however, would require 
its own amendment. Instead, historical progress has mainly
come from the U.S. Supreme Court, which has expanded its interpretation
of existing constitutional laws to keep up with the times. Considering that Supreme Court justices
are unelected and serve for life once appointed, this is far from 
the most democratic option. Interestingly, the founders themselves
may have foreseen this problem early on. In a letter to James Madison, Thomas Jefferson wrote 
that laws should expire every 19 years rather than having to be changed
or repealed since every political process 
is full of obstacles that distort the will of the people. Although he believed that the basic principles 
of the Constitution would endure, he stressed that the Earth belongs
to the living, and not to the dead.

**Transcript**:
This is a thinker who helps us understand
why our lives and relationships are full of so much confusion and pain. He tells us why
life is hard, and how to cope. His own life incurred a lot of anxiety. Sigmund
Schlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish family in 1856. His professional life was not an immediate
success. As a medical student, he dissected hundreds of eels in an unsuccessful attempt
to locate their reproductive organs. He promoted cocaine as a medical drug, but
it turned out to be a dangerous and addictive idea. A few years later he founded the discipline
that would ultimately make his name. A new psychological medicine he called PSYCHOANALYSIS The landmark study was his 1900 book The Interpretation
of Dreams. Many others followed. Despite his success, he was often unhappy. During some particularly strenuous research
he recorded, “The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself…” He was convinced he would
die between 61 and 62 and had great phobias about those numbers. (Although he actually
died much later, at age 83.) Perhaps because of his frustrations, Freud
achieved a series of deep insights into the sources of human unhappiness. He proposed that we are all driven by the: Pleasure Principle which inclines us towards easy physical and
emotional rewards: and away from unpleasant things like drudgery
and discipline. As infants we are guided more or less solely according to the pleasure principle,
Freud argued. But it will, if adhered to without constraints,
lead us to dangerous reckless things: like never doing any work
eating too much or, most notoriously, sleeping with members
of own family. We need to adjust to what Freud called THE REALITY PRINCIPLE Though we all have to bow to this reality
principle, Freud believed that there were better and worse kinds of adaptations. He
called the troublesome ones NEUROSES Neuroses are the result of faulty negotiations
with –or in Freud’s language, repression of–the pleasure principle. Freud described a conflict between three parts
of our minds: the ID driven by the pleasure principle, and the THE SUPEREGO driven by a desire to follow the rules and
do the right thing according to society. and the EGO which has to somehow accomodate the two. To understand more about these dynamics, Freud
urged us to think back to the origins of our neuroses in childhood. As we grow up, we go through what Freud termed: THE ORAL PHASE where we deal with all the feelings around
ingestion and eating. If our parents aren’t careful we might pick
up all kinds of neuroses here: we might take pleasure in refusing food, or turn to food
to calm ourselves down, or hate the idea of depending on anyone else for food. Then comes THE ANAL PHASE which is closely aligned with what we now
call “potty-training”. During this period, our parents tell us what
to do--and when to go. At this phase we begin to learn about testing the limits of authority. Again, if things go wrong, if we don’t feel
authority is benign enough, we might, for example, choose to withhold out of defiance. Then, as adults, we might become “anally
retentive”; in other words, not able to give or surrender. Next comes: THE PHALLIC PHASE which goes until about age 6. Freud shocked
his contemporaries by insisting that little children have sexual feelings. Moreover, in
the phallic phase children direct their sexual impulses towards their parents, the most immediately
available and gratifying people around. Freud famously described what he called THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX Where we are unconsciously predisposed towards “being in love with the one parent and hating the other.” What is complex is that no matter how much
our parents love us, they cannot extend this to sexual life and will always have another
life with a partner. This makes our young selves feel dangerously jealous and angry
– and also ashamed and guilty about this anger. The complex provides a huge amount
of internalised worry for a small child. Ultimately, most of us experience some form of confusion around our parents that later ties into our ideas of love. Mum and dad may both give us love, but they
often mix it in with disturbed behaviour. Yet because we love them, we remain loyal
to them and also to their bizarre, destructive patterns. For example, if our mother is cold,
we will be apt nevertheless to long for her. And as a result, however, we may be prone
to always associate love with a certain distance. Naturally, the result is very difficult adult
relationships. Often the kind of love we’ve learned from mum and dad means we can’t
fuse sex and love because the people we learnt about love from are also those we were blocked
from having sex with. We might find that the more in love with someone we are, the harder
it becomes to make love to them. This can reach a pitch of crisis after a few years
of marriage and some kids. Freud compared the issues we so often have
with intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter: they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also
can’t come too close because they’re prickly. There’s no easy solution. Freud says we
can’t make ourselves fully rational, and we can’t change society, either. In his
1930 book Civilisation and its Discontents, Freud wrote that society provides us with
many things, but it does this by imposing heavy dictates on us: insisting that we sleep
with only a few (usually one) other, imposing the incest taboo, requiring us to put off
our immediate desires, demanding that we follow authority and work to make money. Societies
themselves are neurotic–that is how they function - and it’s why there are constant
wars and other troubles. Freud attempted to invent a treatment for
our many neuroses: psychoanalysis. He thought that with a little proper analysis, people
could uncover what ails them and better adjust to the difficulties of reality. In his sessions he analysed a number of key
things. He looked at people’s dreams, which he saw as expressions of WISH FULFILLMENTS He also looked at PARAPRAXES or slips of the tongue. We now call these revealing mistakes FREUDIAN SLIPS Like when we write ‘thigh’ when we wanted
to write ‘though’. He also liked to think about jokes. He believed
that jokes often help us make fun of something symbolic like death or marriage, and thus
relieve some of our anxiety about these topics. There’s a temptation to say Freud just made
everything up, and life isn’t quite so hard as he makes it out to be. But then one morning
we find ourselves filled with inexplicable anger towards our partner, or running high
with unrelenting anxiety on the train to work, and we’re reminded all over again just how
elusive, difficult, and Freudian our mental workings actually are. We could still reject his work, of course.
But as Freud said, “No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.” We could all use a bit more of Freud’s ideas to help us unpick ourselves.

**Transcript**:
This is a thinker who helps us understand
why our lives and relationships are full of so much confusion and pain. He tells us why
life is hard, and how to cope. His own life incurred a lot of anxiety. Sigmund
Schlomo Freud was born to a middle-class Jewish family in 1856. His professional life was not an immediate
success. As a medical student, he dissected hundreds of eels in an unsuccessful attempt
to locate their reproductive organs. He promoted cocaine as a medical drug, but
it turned out to be a dangerous and addictive idea. A few years later he founded the discipline
that would ultimately make his name. A new psychological medicine he called PSYCHOANALYSIS The landmark study was his 1900 book The Interpretation
of Dreams. Many others followed. Despite his success, he was often unhappy. During some particularly strenuous research
he recorded, “The chief patient I am preoccupied with is myself…” He was convinced he would
die between 61 and 62 and had great phobias about those numbers. (Although he actually
died much later, at age 83.) Perhaps because of his frustrations, Freud
achieved a series of deep insights into the sources of human unhappiness. He proposed that we are all driven by the: Pleasure Principle which inclines us towards easy physical and
emotional rewards: and away from unpleasant things like drudgery
and discipline. As infants we are guided more or less solely according to the pleasure principle,
Freud argued. But it will, if adhered to without constraints,
lead us to dangerous reckless things: like never doing any work
eating too much or, most notoriously, sleeping with members
of own family. We need to adjust to what Freud called THE REALITY PRINCIPLE Though we all have to bow to this reality
principle, Freud believed that there were better and worse kinds of adaptations. He
called the troublesome ones NEUROSES Neuroses are the result of faulty negotiations
with –or in Freud’s language, repression of–the pleasure principle. Freud described a conflict between three parts
of our minds: the ID driven by the pleasure principle, and the THE SUPEREGO driven by a desire to follow the rules and
do the right thing according to society. and the EGO which has to somehow accomodate the two. To understand more about these dynamics, Freud
urged us to think back to the origins of our neuroses in childhood. As we grow up, we go through what Freud termed: THE ORAL PHASE where we deal with all the feelings around
ingestion and eating. If our parents aren’t careful we might pick
up all kinds of neuroses here: we might take pleasure in refusing food, or turn to food
to calm ourselves down, or hate the idea of depending on anyone else for food. Then comes THE ANAL PHASE which is closely aligned with what we now
call “potty-training”. During this period, our parents tell us what
to do--and when to go. At this phase we begin to learn about testing the limits of authority. Again, if things go wrong, if we don’t feel
authority is benign enough, we might, for example, choose to withhold out of defiance. Then, as adults, we might become “anally
retentive”; in other words, not able to give or surrender. Next comes: THE PHALLIC PHASE which goes until about age 6. Freud shocked
his contemporaries by insisting that little children have sexual feelings. Moreover, in
the phallic phase children direct their sexual impulses towards their parents, the most immediately
available and gratifying people around. Freud famously described what he called THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX Where we are unconsciously predisposed towards “being in love with the one parent and hating the other.” What is complex is that no matter how much
our parents love us, they cannot extend this to sexual life and will always have another
life with a partner. This makes our young selves feel dangerously jealous and angry
– and also ashamed and guilty about this anger. The complex provides a huge amount
of internalised worry for a small child. Ultimately, most of us experience some form of confusion around our parents that later ties into our ideas of love. Mum and dad may both give us love, but they
often mix it in with disturbed behaviour. Yet because we love them, we remain loyal
to them and also to their bizarre, destructive patterns. For example, if our mother is cold,
we will be apt nevertheless to long for her. And as a result, however, we may be prone
to always associate love with a certain distance. Naturally, the result is very difficult adult
relationships. Often the kind of love we’ve learned from mum and dad means we can’t
fuse sex and love because the people we learnt about love from are also those we were blocked
from having sex with. We might find that the more in love with someone we are, the harder
it becomes to make love to them. This can reach a pitch of crisis after a few years
of marriage and some kids. Freud compared the issues we so often have
with intimacy to hedgehogs in the winter: they need to cuddle for warmth, but they also
can’t come too close because they’re prickly. There’s no easy solution. Freud says we
can’t make ourselves fully rational, and we can’t change society, either. In his
1930 book Civilisation and its Discontents, Freud wrote that society provides us with
many things, but it does this by imposing heavy dictates on us: insisting that we sleep
with only a few (usually one) other, imposing the incest taboo, requiring us to put off
our immediate desires, demanding that we follow authority and work to make money. Societies
themselves are neurotic–that is how they function - and it’s why there are constant
wars and other troubles. Freud attempted to invent a treatment for
our many neuroses: psychoanalysis. He thought that with a little proper analysis, people
could uncover what ails them and better adjust to the difficulties of reality. In his sessions he analysed a number of key
things. He looked at people’s dreams, which he saw as expressions of WISH FULFILLMENTS He also looked at PARAPRAXES or slips of the tongue. We now call these revealing mistakes FREUDIAN SLIPS Like when we write ‘thigh’ when we wanted
to write ‘though’. He also liked to think about jokes. He believed
that jokes often help us make fun of something symbolic like death or marriage, and thus
relieve some of our anxiety about these topics. There’s a temptation to say Freud just made
everything up, and life isn’t quite so hard as he makes it out to be. But then one morning
we find ourselves filled with inexplicable anger towards our partner, or running high
with unrelenting anxiety on the train to work, and we’re reminded all over again just how
elusive, difficult, and Freudian our mental workings actually are. We could still reject his work, of course.
But as Freud said, “No one who disdains the key will ever be able to unlock the door.” We could all use a bit more of Freud’s ideas to help us unpick ourselves.

**Transcript**:
More than a century after first emerging into the fog-bound,
gas-lit streets of Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes 
is universally recognizable. Even his wardrobe and accessories
are iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend
and housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular
consciousness, as have his extraordinary,
infallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase,
"Elementary, my dear Watson." And yet many of these most recognizable
features of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's
original stories. Doyle's great detective solves
crimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses,
and regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson 
is barely mentioned, no one says, "Elementary, my dear Watson," and the detective and his sidekick
live apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain, 
only appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent
after the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled
to the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form
of natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements
of the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape
were first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by
American actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see
his face on stage, and the phrase, 
"Elementary, my dear Watson," was coined by author and humorist
P.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective,
and where do we find him? Purists might answer 
that the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 
university mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version
of Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective 
largely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying
answer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider
the vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands 
of adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted
fictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian
stage adaptations, and accelerated 
with the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations
of Holmes in the first two decades 
of the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands
more in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted
by people everywhere, in remarkably different,
and often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate
both Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number
of allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining 
the Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service
hideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various
German-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been
much-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes
please stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation
has made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new
interpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock 
continually evolves, embodying ideas and values 
often far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends,
Sherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms
or turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock,
our Sherlock.

of natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements
of the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape
were first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by
American actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see
his face on stage, and the phrase, 
"Elementary, my dear Watson," was coined by author and humorist
P.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective,
and where do we find him? Purists might answer 
that the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's 
university mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version
of Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective 
largely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying
answer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider
the vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands 
of adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted
fictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian
stage adaptations, and accelerated 
with the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations
of Holmes in the first two decades 
of the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands
more in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted
by people everywhere, in remarkably different,
and often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate
both Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number
of allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining 
the Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service
hideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various
German-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been
much-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes
please stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation
has made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new
interpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock 
continually evolves, embodying ideas and values 
often far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends,
Sherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms
or turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock,
our Sherlock.

**Transcript**:
More than a century after first emerging into the fog-bound,
gas-lit streets of Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes 
is universally recognizable. Even his wardrobe and accessories
are iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend
and housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular
consciousness, as have his extraordinary,
infallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase,
"Elementary, my dear Watson." And yet many of these most recognizable
features of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's
original stories. Doyle's great detective solves
crimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses,
and regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson 
is barely mentioned, no one says, "Elementary, my dear Watson," and the detective and his sidekick
live apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain, 
only appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent
after the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled
to the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form
of natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements

**Transcript**:
What is consciousness? Can an artificial machine really think? Does the mind just consist of neurons
in the brain, or is there some intangible spark
at its core? For many, these have been
vital considerations for the future of artificial intelligence. But British computer scientist Alan Turing
decided to disregard all these questions in favor of a much simpler one: can a computer talk like a human? This question led to an idea for measuring
aritificial intelligence that would famously come to be known
as the Turing test. In the 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery
and Intelligence," Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation
with unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must
be able to replace one of the players without substantially 
changing the results. In other words, a computer would be
considered intelligent if its conversation couldn't be easily
distinguished from a human's. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 megabytes of memory
would be able to easily pass his test. But he may have jumped the gun. Even though today's computers
have far more memory than that, few have succeeded, and those that have done well focused more on finding clever ways
to fool judges than using overwhelming computing power. Though it was never subjected
to a real test, the first program with 
some claim to success was called ELIZA. With only a fairly short 
and simple script, it managed to mislead many people
by mimicking a psychologist, encouraging them to talk more and reflecting their own questions
back at them. Another early script PARRY
took the opposite approach by imitating a paranoid schizophrenic who kept steering the conversation
back to his own preprogrammed obsessions. Their success in fooling people
highlighted one weakness of the test. Humans regularly attribute intelligence
to a whole range of things that are not actually intelligent. Nonetheless, annual competitions
like the Loebner Prize, have made the test more formal with judges knowing ahead of time that some of their conversation partners 
are machines. But while the quality has improved, many chatbot programmers have used
similar strategies to ELIZA and PARRY. 1997's winner Catherine could carry on amazingly focused 
and intelligent conversation, but mostly if the judge wanted
to talk about Bill Clinton. And the more recent winner
Eugene Goostman was given the persona
of a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, so judges interpreted its nonsequiturs
and awkward grammar as language and culture barriers. Meanwhile, other programs like Cleverbot
have taken a different approach by statistically analyzing huge databases
of real conversations to determine the best responses. Some also store memories 
of previous conversations in order to improve over time. But while Cleverbot's individual responses
can sound incredibly human, its lack of a consistent personality and inability to deal 
with brand new topics are a dead giveaway. Who in Turing's day could have predicted
that today's computers would be able to pilot spacecraft, perform delicate surgeries, and solve massive equations, but still struggle with 
the most basic small talk? Human language turns out to be
an amazingly complex phenomenon that can't be captured by even
the largest dictionary. Chatbots can be baffled by simple pauses,
like "umm..." or questions with no correct answer. And a simple conversational sentence, like, "I took the juice out of the fridge
and gave it to him, but forgot to check the date," requires a wealth of underlying knowledge
and intuition to parse. It turns out that simulating 
a human conversation takes more than just increasing
memory and processing power, and as we get closer to Turing's goal, we may have to deal with all those big
questions about consciousness after all.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 4
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What is consciousness? Can an artificial machine really think? Does the mind just consist of neurons
in the brain, or is there some intangible spark
at its core? For many, these have been
vital considerations for the future of artificial intelligence. But British computer scientist Alan Turing
decided to disregard all these questions in favor of a much simpler one: can a computer talk like a human? This question led to an idea for measuring
aritificial intelligence that would famously come to be known
as the Turing test. In the 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery
and Intelligence," Turing proposed the following game. A human judge has a text conversation
with unseen players and evaluates their responses. To pass the test, a computer must
be able to replace one of the players without substantially 
changing the results. In other words, a computer would be
considered intelligent if its conversation couldn't be easily
distinguished from a human's. Turing predicted that by the year 2000, machines with 100 megabytes of memory
would be able to easily pass his test. But he may have jumped the gun. Even though today's computers
have far more memory than that, few have succeeded, and those that have done well focused more on finding clever ways
to fool judges than using overwhelming computing power. Though it was never subjected
to a real test, the first program with 
some claim to success was called ELIZA. With only a fairly short 
and simple script, it managed to mislead many people
by mimicking a psychologist, encouraging them to talk more and reflecting their own questions
back at them. Another early script PARRY
took the opposite approach by imitating a paranoid schizophrenic who kept steering the conversation
back to his own preprogrammed obsessions. Their success in fooling people
highlighted one weakness of the test. Humans regularly attribute intelligence
to a whole range of things that are not actually intelligent. Nonetheless, annual competitions
like the Loebner Prize, have made the test more formal with judges knowing ahead of time that some of their conversation partners 
are machines. But while the quality has improved, many chatbot programmers have used
similar strategies to ELIZA and PARRY. 1997's winner Catherine could carry on amazingly focused 
and intelligent conversation, but mostly if the judge wanted
to talk about Bill Clinton. And the more recent winner
Eugene Goostman was given the persona
of a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, so judges interpreted its nonsequiturs
and awkward grammar as language and culture barriers. Meanwhile, other programs like Cleverbot
have taken a different approach by statistically analyzing huge databases
of real conversations to determine the best responses. Some also store memories 
of previous conversations in order to improve over time. But while Cleverbot's individual responses
can sound incredibly human, its lack of a consistent personality and inability to deal 
with brand new topics are a dead giveaway. Who in Turing's day could have predicted
that today's computers would be able to pilot spacecraft, perform delicate surgeries, and solve massive equations, but still struggle with 
the most basic small talk? Human language turns out to be
an amazingly complex phenomenon that can't be captured by even
the largest dictionary. Chatbots can be baffled by simple pauses,
like "umm..." or questions with no correct answer. And a simple conversational sentence, like, "I took the juice out of the fridge
and gave it to him, but forgot to check the date," requires a wealth of underlying knowledge
and intuition to parse. It turns out that simulating 
a human conversation takes more than just increasing
memory and processing power, and as we get closer to Turing's goal, we may have to deal with all those big
questions about consciousness after all.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part
when suddenly he interrupts, "The alien and I," not "Me and the alien." Most of us would probably be annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your sentence actually 
grammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it,
why does it even matter? From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns 
for how words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing. Different languages 
have different patterns. In English, the subject 
normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese 
and many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb. Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called 
linguistic universals have been found. And while any language needs consistent
patterns to function, the study of these patterns opens up
an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism
and descriptivism. Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language 
should follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation
and adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language. For much of history, the vast majority
of language was spoken. But as people became more interconnected
and writing gained importance, written language was standardized
to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts
of a realm could understand each other. In many languages, this standard form
came to be considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one
of many spoken varieties, usually that of the people in power. Language purists worked to establish
and propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected
the established grammar of their times. And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well. Speech patterns that deviated from the
written rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people who had grown up
speaking in these ways were forced to adopt 
the standardized form. More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech
is a separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns. Most of us learn to speak at such an early
age that we don't even remember it. We form our spoken repertoire through
unconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses mood
and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers
and listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses
that are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward
pronounciation, or removing sounds to make speech faster. The linguistic approach that tries
to understand and map such differences without dictating correct ones
is known as descriptivism. Rather than deciding how language
should be used, it describes how people actually use it, and tracks the innovations 
they come up with in the process. But while the debate between prescriptivism 
and descriptivism continues, the two are not mutually exclusive. At its best, prescriptivism is useful
for informing people about the most common established
patterns at a given point in time. This is important, 
not only for formal contexts, but it also makes communication easier
between non-native speakers from different backgrounds. Descriptivism, on the other hand, gives us insight into how our minds work and the instinctive ways in which we 
structure our view of the world. Ultimately, grammar is best thought of
as a set of linguistic habits that are constantly being negotiated
and reinvented by the entire group of language users. Like language itself, it's a wonderful and complex fabric woven through the contributions
of speakers and listeners, writers and readers, prescriptivists and descriptivists, from both near and far.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You're telling a friend an amazing story, and you just get to the best part
when suddenly he interrupts, "The alien and I," not "Me and the alien." Most of us would probably be annoyed, but aside from the rude interruption, does your friend have a point? Was your sentence actually 
grammatically incorrect? And if he still understood it,
why does it even matter? From the point of view of linguistics, grammar is a set of patterns 
for how words are put together to form phrases or clauses, whether spoken or in writing. Different languages 
have different patterns. In English, the subject 
normally comes first, followed by the verb, and then the object, while in Japanese 
and many other languages, the order is subject, object, verb. Some scholars have tried to identify
patterns common to all languages, but apart from some basic features, like having nouns or verbs, few of these so-called 
linguistic universals have been found. And while any language needs consistent
patterns to function, the study of these patterns opens up
an ongoing debate between two positions known as prescriptivism
and descriptivism. Grossly simplified, prescriptivists think a given language 
should follow consistent rules, while descriptivists see variation
and adaptation as a natural and necessary part of language. For much of history, the vast majority
of language was spoken. But as people became more interconnected
and writing gained importance, written language was standardized
to allow broader communication and ensure that people in different parts
of a realm could understand each other. In many languages, this standard form
came to be considered the only proper one, despite being derived from just one
of many spoken varieties, usually that of the people in power. Language purists worked to establish
and propagate this standard by detailing a set of rules that reflected
the established grammar of their times. And rules for written grammar were applied
to spoken language, as well. Speech patterns that deviated from the
written rules were considered corruptions, or signs of low social status, and many people who had grown up
speaking in these ways were forced to adopt 
the standardized form. More recently, however, linguists have understood that speech
is a separate phenomenon from writing with its own regularities and patterns. Most of us learn to speak at such an early
age that we don't even remember it. We form our spoken repertoire through
unconscious habits, not memorized rules. And because speech also uses mood
and intonation for meaning, its structure is often more flexible, adapting to the needs of speakers
and listeners. This could mean avoiding complex clauses
that are hard to parse in real time, making changes to avoid awkward

**Transcript**:
Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary
in the minds of hikers, adventurers, and dreamers alike.

**Transcript**:
Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies 
near the tropics, so the snowline is high,
and the glaciers relatively small, barely big enough to widdle it down. The mountain exists in a perfect storm
of conditions that maintain its impressive stature. But that won't always be the case. We live in a changing world 
where the continental plates, Earth's climate, and the planet's erosive power might one day conspire to cut 
Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary
in the minds of hikers, adventurers, and dreamers alike.

Mount Everest down to size. For now, at least, it remains legendary

**Transcript**:
Every spring, hundreds of adventure-seekers dream
of climbing Qomolangma, also known as Mount Everest. At base camp, they hunker down for months waiting for the chance to scale 
the mountain's lofty, lethal peak. But why do people risk life and limb
to climb Everest? Is it the challenge? The view? The chance to touch the sky? For many, the draw is Everest's status
as the highest mountain on Earth. There's an important distinction
to make here. Mauna Kea is actually the tallest
from base to summit, but at 8850 meters above sea level, Everest has the highest altitude 
on the planet. To understand how 
this towering formation was born, we have to peer deep 
into our planet's crust, where continental plates collide. The Earth's surface 
is like an armadillo's armor. Pieces of crust constantly move over, under, and around each other. For such huge continental plates,
the motion is relatively quick. They move two to four 
centimeters per year, about as fast as fingernails grow. When two plates collide, one pushes into or underneath the other,
buckling at the margins, and causing what's known as uplift
to accomodate the extra crust. That's how Everest came about. 50 million years ago, the Earth's 
Indian Plate drifted north, bumped into the bigger Eurasian Plate, and the crust crumpled,
creating huge uplift. Mountain Everest lies at the heart
of this action, on the edge of the Indian-Eurasian 
collision zone. But mountains are shaped by forces
other than uplift. As the land is pushed up, 
air masses are forced to rise as well. Rising air cools, causing any water
vapor within it to condense and form rain or snow. As that falls, 
it wears down the landscape, dissolving rocks or breaking them down
in a process known as weathering. Water moving downhill carries
the weathered material and erodes the landscape, carving out deep valleys and jagged peaks. This balance between uplift and erosion
gives a mountain its shape. But compare the celestial peaks
of the Himalayas to the comforting hills of Appalachia. Clearly, all mountains are not alike. That's because time 
comes into the equation, too. When continental plates first collide,
uplift happens fast. The peaks grow tall with steep slopes. Over time, however, gravity and water
wear them down. Eventually, erosion overtakes uplift, wearing down peaks 
faster than they're pushed up. A third factor shapes mountains: climate. In subzero temperatures, some snowfall
doesn't completely melt away, instead slowly compacting 
until it becomes ice. That forms the snowline, which occurs
at different heights around the planet depending on climate. At the freezing poles,
the snowline is at sea level. Near the equator, you have to climb
five kilometers before it gets cold enough for ice to form. Gathered ice starts flowing under
its own immense weight forming a slow-moving frozen river
known as a glacier, which grinds the rocks below. The steeper the mountains, 
the faster ice flows, and the quicker it carves 
the underlying rock. Glaciers can erode landscapes
swifter than rain and rivers. Where glaciers cling to mountain peaks,
they sand them down so fast, they lop the tops off
like giant snowy buzzsaws. So then, how did the icy Mount Everest
come to be so tall? The cataclysmic continental clash
from which it arose made it huge to begin with. Secondly, the mountain lies

**Transcript**:
In 1996, 56 volunteers took part
in a study to test a new painkiller called
Trivaricaine. On each subject, one index finger
was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed
in painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated
finger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually
a painkiller, just a fake concotion 
with no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure
this dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies
that aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo
since the 1700s when they realized the power of
fake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs
weren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo
means "I shall please" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating
troubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments
in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people
in this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using
placebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive
the real pill. The other half would get a placebo
that looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether
they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant
benefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos
this way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug
against an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving
someone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used
as a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus
the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos
exert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief 
from a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received
was a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused
with other factors, like patients trying to please doctors
by falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person 
believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually
do trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing
measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing
chemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies
often say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels
of stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects
of an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate
the placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment
has cured them, they may miss out on drugs
or therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects 
may fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even 
more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about
the human body, there are still some strange
and enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels
might we contain? It's easy to investigate the world
around us and forget that one of its most 
fascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes.

**Transcript**:
In 1996, 56 volunteers took part
in a study to test a new painkiller called
Trivaricaine. On each subject, one index finger
was covered in the new painkiller while the other remained untouched. Then, both were squeezed
in painful clamps. The subjects reported that the treated
finger hurt less than the untreated one. This shouldn't be surprising, except Trivaricaine wasn't actually
a painkiller, just a fake concotion 
with no pain-easing properties at all. What made the students so sure
this dummy drug had worked? The answer lies in the placebo effect, an unexplained phenomenon wherein drugs, treatments, and therapies
that aren't supposed to have an effect, and are often fake, miraculously make people feel better. Doctors have used the term placebo
since the 1700s when they realized the power of
fake drugs to improve people's symptoms. These were administered when proper drugs
weren't available, or if someone imagined they were ill. In fact, the word placebo
means "I shall please" in Latin, hinting at a history of placating
troubled patients. Placebos had to mimic the real treatments
in order to be convincing, so they took the form of sugar pills, water-filled injections, and even sham surgeries. Soon, doctors realized that duping people
in this way had another use: in clinical trials. By the 1950s, researchers were using
placebos as a standard tool to test new treatments. To evaluate a new drug, for instance, half the patients in a trial might receive
the real pill. The other half would get a placebo
that looked the same. Since patients wouldn't know whether
they'd received the real thing or a dud, the results wouldn't be biased, researchers believed. Then, if the new drug showed a significant
benefit compared to the placebo, it was proved effective. Nowadays, it's less common to use placebos
this way because of ethical concerns. If it's possible to compare a new drug
against an older version, or another existing drug, that's preferable to simply giving
someone no treatment at all, especially if they have a serious ailment. In these cases, placebos are often used
as a control to fine-tune the trial so that the effects of the new versus
the old or alternative drug can be precisely compared. But of course, we know the placebos
exert their own influence, too. Thanks to the placebo effect, patients have experienced relief 
from a range of ailments, including heart problems, asthma, and severe pain, even though all they'd received
was a fake drug or sham surgery. We're still trying to understand how. Some believe that instead of being real, the placebo effect is merely confused
with other factors, like patients trying to please doctors
by falsely reporting improvements. On the other hand, researchers think that if a person 
believes a fake treatment is real, their expectations of recovery actually
do trigger physiological factors that improve their symptoms. Placebos seem to be capable of causing
measurable change in blood pressure, heart rate, and the release of pain-reducing
chemicals, like endorphins. That explains why subjects in pain studies
often say placebos ease their discomfort. Placebos may even reduce levels
of stress hormones, like adrenaline, which can slow the harmful effects
of an ailment. So shouldn't we celebrate
the placebo's bizarre benefits? Not necessarily. If somebody believes a fake treatment
has cured them, they may miss out on drugs
or therapies that are proven to work. Plus, the positive effects 
may fade over time, and often do. Placebos also cloud clinical results, making scientists even 
more motivated to discover how they wield such power over us. Despite everything we know about
the human body, there are still some strange
and enduring mysteries, like the placebo effect. So what other undiscovered marvels
might we contain? It's easy to investigate the world
around us and forget that one of its most 
fascinating subjects lies right behind our eyes.

**Transcript**:
Every day, a sea of decisions 
stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact 
on our lives. For example, which politician
should I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make 
a perfect choice every time. But there are many ways 
to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique
is critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully 
deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues,
such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative
that's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer 
because it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny
and skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most
useful and reliable information. There are many different ways
of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve 
any number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, 
know what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward 
as it sounds. For example, if you're deciding
whether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured
by other factors, like claims that you'll see results
in just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're 
actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through 
this information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad
really suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question
will help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet
to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you
weigh different options, moving you closer to a decision
that meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do 
by asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself,
"What concepts are at work?" "What assumptions exist?" "Is my interpretation of the information
logically sound?" For example, in an email that promises
you millions, you should consider, "What is shaping
my approach to this situation?" "Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?" "Based on the evidence, is it logical 
to assume I'll win any money?" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political
candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers
to fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term 
environmental effects? If gasoline use is less 
restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge
surge in air pollution, an unintended consequence 
that's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of 
the opposing political candidate. Even if you disagree with 
everything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't
seem valid to you appeal to others. This will allow you 
to explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more
informed decisions. This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult
decisions from our lives. But it can help us increase 
the number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give us the tools
to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for. And if enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world
a more reasonable place.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is one advantage of critical thinking?
Options: A. It’s a process that helps us make only large, important decisions, B. It’s a process that helps us make only small, unimportant decisions, C. It’s a process that helps us create hidden issues, bias and manipulation, D. It’s a process that helps us reveal hidden issues, bias and manipulation
Correct Option: D

Question: What is a potential benefit of using critical thinking in decision-making?

**Transcript**:
Every day, a sea of decisions 
stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact 
on our lives. For example, which politician
should I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make 
a perfect choice every time. But there are many ways 
to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique
is critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully 
deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues,
such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative
that's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer 
because it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny
and skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most
useful and reliable information. There are many different ways
of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve 
any number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, 
know what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward 
as it sounds. For example, if you're deciding
whether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured
by other factors, like claims that you'll see results
in just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're 
actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through 
this information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad
really suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question
will help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet
to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you
weigh different options, moving you closer to a decision
that meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do 
by asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself,
"What concepts are at work?" "What assumptions exist?" "Is my interpretation of the information
logically sound?" For example, in an email that promises
you millions, you should consider, "What is shaping
my approach to this situation?" "Do I assume the sender 
is telling the truth?" "Based on the evidence, is it logical 
to assume I'll win any money?" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political
candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers
to fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term 
environmental effects? If gasoline use is less 
restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge
surge in air pollution, an unintended consequence 
that's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of 
the opposing political candidate. Even if you disagree with 
everything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't
seem valid to you appeal to others. This will allow you 
to explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more
informed decisions. This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult
decisions from our lives. But it can help us increase 
the number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give us the tools
to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for. And if enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world

**Transcript**:
In ancient Greece, violent internal
conflict between bordering neighbors and war with foreign invaders
was a way of life, and Greeks were considered
premier warriors. Most Greek city-states surrounded
themselves with massive defensive walls for added protection. Sparta in its prime was a different story, finding walls unnecessary when it had an army of the most feared
warriors in the ancient world. So what was Sparta doing differently
than everyone else to produce such fierce soldiers? To answer that question, we turn to
the written accounts of that time. There are no surviving written accounts
from Spartans themselves, as it was forbidden for Spartans
to keep records, so we have to rely on those of
non-Spartan ancient historians, like Herodotus, Thucydides,
and Plutarch. These stories may be embellished and depict Sparta 
at the apex of its power, so take them with a grain of salt. For Spartans, the purpose for their
existence was simple: to serve Sparta. On the day of their birth, elder Spartan leaders examined
every newborn. The strong healthy babies were considered
capable of fulfilling this purpose, and the others may have been left
on Mount Taygetus to die. Every Spartan, boy or girl,
was expected to be physically strong, mentally sharp, and emotionally resilient. And it was their absolute duty
to defend and promote Sparta at all costs. So in the first years of their lives, children were raised to understand that
their loyalty belonged first to Sparta, and then to family. This mindset probably made it easier
for the Spartan boys, who upon turning seven,
were sent to the agoge, a place with one main purpose: to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior through thirteen years of relentless,
harsh, and often brutal training. The Spartans prized physical perfection
above all else, and so the students spent a great deal
of their time learning how to fight. To ensure resilience in battle, boys were encouraged to fight
among themselves, and bullying, unlike today, 
was acceptable. In order to better prepare the boys
for the conditions of war, the boys were poorly fed, sometimes even going days without eating. They also were given little 
in the way of clothing so that they could learn to deal
with different temperatures. Spartan boys were encouraged
to steal in order to survive, but if they were caught, they would be disciplined, not because they stole,
but because they were caught in the act. During the annual contest of endurance in a religious ritual known as
the diamastigosis, teenage boys were whipped
in front of an altar at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. It was common for boys to die
on the altar of the goddess. Fortunately, not everything
was as brutal as that. Young Spartans were also taught
how to read, write, and dance, which taught them graceful control
of their movements and helped them in combat. While the responsibilities for the girls
of Sparta were different, the high standards of excellence and expectation to serve 
Sparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with
their mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,
they learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only
strong and capable women could bear children that would one day
become strong and capable warriors. To all Spartans, men and women, perhaps the most important lesson
from Spartan school was allegiance to Sparta. To die for their city-state was seen
as the completion of one's duty to Sparta. Upon their death, only men who died in battle
and women who died in childbirth were given tombstones. In the eyes of their countrymen,
both died so that Sparta could live.

at the apex of its power, so take them with a grain of salt. For Spartans, the purpose for their
existence was simple: to serve Sparta. On the day of their birth, elder Spartan leaders examined
every newborn. The strong healthy babies were considered
capable of fulfilling this purpose, and the others may have been left
on Mount Taygetus to die. Every Spartan, boy or girl,
was expected to be physically strong, mentally sharp, and emotionally resilient. And it was their absolute duty
to defend and promote Sparta at all costs. So in the first years of their lives, children were raised to understand that
their loyalty belonged first to Sparta, and then to family. This mindset probably made it easier
for the Spartan boys, who upon turning seven,
were sent to the agoge, a place with one main purpose: to turn a boy into a Spartan warrior through thirteen years of relentless,
harsh, and often brutal training. The Spartans prized physical perfection
above all else, and so the students spent a great deal
of their time learning how to fight. To ensure resilience in battle, boys were encouraged to fight
among themselves, and bullying, unlike today, 
was acceptable. In order to better prepare the boys
for the conditions of war, the boys were poorly fed, sometimes even going days without eating. They also were given little 
in the way of clothing so that they could learn to deal
with different temperatures. Spartan boys were encouraged
to steal in order to survive, but if they were caught, they would be disciplined, not because they stole,
but because they were caught in the act. During the annual contest of endurance in a religious ritual known as
the diamastigosis, teenage boys were whipped
in front of an altar at the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. It was common for boys to die
on the altar of the goddess. Fortunately, not everything
was as brutal as that. Young Spartans were also taught
how to read, write, and dance, which taught them graceful control
of their movements and helped them in combat. While the responsibilities for the girls
of Sparta were different, the high standards of excellence and expectation to serve 
Sparta with their lives remained the same. Spartan girls lived at home with
their mothers as they attended school. Their curriculum included the arts, music, dance, reading, and writing. And to stay in peak physical condition,
they learned a variety of sports, such as discus, javelin, and horseback riding. In Sparta, it was believed that only
strong and capable women could bear children that would one day
become strong and capable warriors. To all Spartans, men and women, perhaps the most important lesson
from Spartan school was allegiance to Sparta. To die for their city-state was seen
as the completion of one's duty to Sparta. Upon their death, only men who died in battle
and women who died in childbirth were given tombstones. In the eyes of their countrymen,
both died so that Sparta could live.

In ancient Greece, violent internal
conflict between bordering neighbors and war with foreign invaders
was a way of life, and Greeks were considered

**Transcript**:
Rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, changing landscapes. Successfully adapting to climate change
is growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using
our technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities
and better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes
involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs
along time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under
especially strong selective conditions, like those caused 
by rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution 
can happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes
to their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes
to an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much
an organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking
examples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry
forest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard,
rather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been
near impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly
less snowfall, but you'd still struggle 
to spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically
dominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage
in helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces
opportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing 
the battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs,
on the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive 
genetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes 
have rapidly evolved to take advantage 
of the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later 
and later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers
of melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely
to the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them
from overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted
to warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season
to protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe
are producing more repellent oils to protect themselves 
against the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group
of about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations
to rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover
more species evolving in response to climate change
out of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding
and precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species
will have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is
we already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making
on-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges 
are being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help
mobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas
are also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope. Fortunately, it's still within our power to preserve much of 
the wondrous biodiversity of this planet, which, after all, sustains us
in so many ways.

**Transcript**:
Rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, changing landscapes. Successfully adapting to climate change
is growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using
our technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities
and better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes
involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs
along time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under
especially strong selective conditions, like those caused 
by rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution 
can happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes
to their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes
to an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much
an organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking
examples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry
forest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard,
rather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been
near impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly
less snowfall, but you'd still struggle 
to spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically
dominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage
in helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces
opportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing 
the battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs,
on the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive 
genetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes 
have rapidly evolved to take advantage 
of the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later 
and later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers
of melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely
to the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them
from overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted
to warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season
to protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe
are producing more repellent oils to protect themselves 
against the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group
of about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations
to rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover
more species evolving in response to climate change
out of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding
and precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species
will have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is
we already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making
on-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges 
are being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help
mobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas
are also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope. Fortunately, it's still within our power to preserve much of 
the wondrous biodiversity of this planet, which, after all, sustains us
in so many ways.

**Transcript**:
If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings, and decided to wage war on us, there's no doubt that humans
would lose. We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains
a million known species, and many others 
that haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down
to many things that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly, and can occur over and over again
in a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity. The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive in a range of environments
across the planet. Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor, protecting insects against
the outside world and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit
a small space and make use of all the available
resources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out
and get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share 
an ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched. We may have to accept 
that it's insects, not us, that are the true conquerors 
of the planet.

**Transcript**:
If insects suddenly morphed
into large beings, and decided to wage war on us, there's no doubt that humans
would lose. We'd simply be crushed 
by their sheer numbers. There are an estimated 10 quintillion
individual insects on Earth. That's a one followed by 19 zeroes. So, compared with our population
of about 7 billion, these invertebrates outnumber
us by more than a billion to one. Their astounding numbers exist
at the species level, as well. There are more than 60,000
vertebrate species on the planet. But the class of insects contains
a million known species, and many others 
that haven't been classified. In fact, these critters make up 
approximately 75% of all animals on Earth. So, what's their secret to success? Insect abundance comes down
to many things that together make them some of the most
adaptable and resilient creatures, beginning with their impressive 
ability to breed. Many species can produce hundreds
of offspring within their lifetimes. Most offspring will die, but more than enough will survive
into adulthood to reproduce. Offspring also mature very rapidly, so the cycle of reproduction
resumes quickly, and can occur over and over again
in a short time. These numbers mean that as a class, insects harbor a tremendous amount
of genetic diversity. The different species contain
a wealth of genetic data that give them the necessary adaptations
they need to thrive in a range of environments
across the planet. Even some of the most extreme
environments are in bounds; Flat bark beetles can live at
-40 degrees Fahrenheit, Sahara Desert ants can venture out when surface temperatures exceed
155 degrees, and some bumblebees can survive
18,000 feet above sea level. Insect exoskeletons also work
like body armor, protecting insects against
the outside world and helping them cope with habitats
that other creatures can't. Even their small size, which we might see as a disadvantage, is something they use to their benefit. Because most species are so tiny, millions of insects can inhabit
a small space and make use of all the available
resources within it. This means they can occupy hundreds
of different niches across ecosystems. Some insects survive by eating the roots, stems, leaves, seeds, pollen, and nectar of specific plants. Others, like wasps, make use of live insects 
by paralyzing the victims and laying their eggs inside so that when the hatchlings emerge, they can eat their way out
and get nourishment. Mosquitos and biting flies feed on blood, taking advantage of this unusual resource
to ensure their survival. And a whole bunch of other insects
have built a niche around feces. Flies lay their eggs there, and some beetles even build
large balls out of animal dung, which they eat and use as accommodation
for their eggs. And then there's the insects' mighty power
of metamorphosis. This trait not only transforms insects, but also helps them maximize
the available resources in an ecosystem. Take butterflies. In their larval caterpillar form, they chomp hungrily through leaves
at a rapid rate to help them grow and spin cocoons. But when they emerge as butterflies, these insects feed only on flower nectar. Metamorphosis means the larvae
and adults of one species will never compete for the same resource, so they successfully share 
an ecological niche without limiting their own success. This process is so efficient that an incredible 86% of insect species
undergo complete metamorphosis. We're big and they're small, so it's easy to forget that these critters
are moving in their millions all around us, all the time. But examine almost any patch of ground, and you're sure to find them there. Their numbers are immense,
and their success is unmatched. We may have to accept 
that it's insects, not us, that are the true conquerors 
of the planet.

**Transcript**:
The term modern art sounds like it
means art that is popular at the moment, but in fact, modern art is a style
that originated over 150 years ago, and includes artists that by now
have attained classic status, such as Picasso, Matisse, and Gauguin. And what's even more ironic is that
the movement they pioneered, considered revolutionary
and even scandalous at the time, was inspired largely by an object
of a traditional and ancient design. As far back as the Renaissance, the primary European art movements
emphasized conventional representation and adherence to classical forms. But that began to change 
in the late 19th century as artists like Van Gogh and Cézanne
expanded the boundaries of painting. Soon, a movement arose that sought
to create an entirely new style of art, and one way of doing so was to look
beyond Western civilization. For example, Paul Gauguin moved
to the island of Tahiti in the 1890s. There, he found inspiration in the island's
inhabitants, landscape, and culture to create artwork that intertwined
European themes and Polynesian lore. Others looked the cultures 
of the Islamic world, but the most influential inspiration
would come from Sub-Saharan Africa. As European empires expanded
deeper into the African continent, its artifacts and artworks made their way
into the hands of museums and collectors. One such collector was Henri Matisse, who showed his friend Picasso 
a mask he had acquired made by the Dan tribe of the Ivory Coast. The mask awoke Picasso's curiosity, leading him to visit the Trocadéro 
Ethnographic Museum in Paris in 1907. Founded to house acquisitions 
from colonial conquests, the museum boasted 
a collection of African art, with stylized figures 
and masks made of wood and decorated with simple colors 
and materials. The visit was a revelation for Picasso, who proclaimed that African masks
were what painting was all about. At this time, Picasso had been working
on a painting of five nude women in a style that would later come
to be known as Cubism. And while three of these ladies
show facial features found in ancient Iberian art, a nod to Picasso's Spanish heritage, the faces of the two on the right
closely resemble African masks. Created in 1907 after hundreds
of sketches and studies, "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" has been considered 
the first truly 20th century masterpiece, breaking with many previously 
held notions in art. It was at once aggressive and abstract, distorted yet primal in its raw geometry, a new artistic language with new forms,
colors, and meanings. And these avant-garde qualities
caused a sensation when the painting was first exhibited
almost ten years later. The public was shocked, critics denounced it as immoral, and even Picasso's own friends
were simultaneously surprised, offended, and mesmerized at his audacity. More artists soon followed 
in Picasso's footsteps. Constantin Brâncuși 
and Amedeo Modigliani in Paris, as well as the German Expressionists, all drew on the aesthetics 
of African sculptures in their work. Others looked to a different continent
for their inspiration. British sculptor Henry Moore based many
of his semi-abstract bronze sculptures on a replica of a chacmool, a distinctive reclining statue
from the Toltec-Maya culture. Pre-Columbian art was also a major
influence for Josef Albers. He created a series of compositions, such as the geometrical series
Homage to the Square, that were inspired by pyramids
and local art he encountered
on his frequent visits to Mexico. Inspiration from ancient cultures initiated one of the most revolutionary 
movements in art history, but were these artists playing the role
of explorers or conquistadors, appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive? Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards. Perhaps not too long from now, the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies, ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.

of explorers or conquistadors, appropriating ideas and profiting
from cultures they considered primitive? Questions like this deserve scrutiny,
as artists continue to redefine standards. Perhaps not too long from now, the bold innovations of modern art
will seem like stale orthodoxies, ready to be overturned by a new set
of radical trailblazers drawing inspiration from another
unlikely source.

**Transcript**:
Ah, romantic love - beautiful and intoxicating, heartbreaking and soul-crushing, often all at the same time. Why do we choose to put ourselves
through its emotional wringer? Does love make our lives meaningful, or is it an escape from our loneliness
and suffering? Is love a disguise for our sexual desire, or a trick of biology
to make us procreate? Is it all we need? Do we need it at all? If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology
has discovered it yet. But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers
have put forward some intriguing theories. Love makes us whole, again. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love
in order to become complete. In his "Symposium",
he wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests 
with the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms,
four legs, and two faces. One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two. Since then, every person has been missing
half of him or herself. Love is the longing to find a soulmate
who'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed
a drunken comedian would say at a party. Love tricks us into having babies. Much, much later, German philosopher
Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love 
based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion. He suggested that we love because
our desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy,
but we are sorely mistaken. Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek
is consummated in our children. When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back 
into our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining
the species and perpetuating the cycle 
of human drudgery. Sounds like somebody needs a hug. Love is escape from our loneliness. According to the Nobel Prize-winning
British philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench
our physical and psychological desires. Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy 
of passionate love, sex is unsatisfying. Our fear of the cold, cruel world
tempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth
helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Love enriches our whole being,
making it the best thing in life. Love is a misleading affliction. Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha,
or the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting
arguments with Russell. Buddha proposed that we love because
we are trying to satisfy our base desires. Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love,
are a great source of suffering. Luckily, Buddha discovered 
the eight-fold path, a sort of program for 
extinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity,
wisdom, and compassion. The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated
this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in 
one of China's greatest classical novels, "Dream of the Red Chamber." In a subplot, Jia Rui 
falls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him. Conflicting emotions of love and hate
tear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror
that can cure him as long as he doesn't 
look at the front of it. But of course, 
he looks at the front of it. He sees Xi-feng. His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away 
in iron chains to die. Not all Buddhists think this way
about romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments
spell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors,
be avoided. Love lets us reach beyond ourselves. Let's end on a slightly 
more positive note. The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire
to integrate with another and that it infuses our lives
with meaning. However, she was less 
concerned with why we love and more interested 
in how we can love better. She saw that the problem
with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it
our only reason for being. Yet, dependence on another 
to justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games. To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised
loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other 
in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives
and the world together. Though we might never know
why we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be
an emotional rollercoaster ride. It's scary and exhilarating. It makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we lose ourselves. Maybe we find ourselves. It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be 
the best thing in life. Will you dare to find out?

**Transcript**:
Ah, romantic love - beautiful and intoxicating, heartbreaking and soul-crushing, often all at the same time. Why do we choose to put ourselves
through its emotional wringer? Does love make our lives meaningful, or is it an escape from our loneliness
and suffering? Is love a disguise for our sexual desire, or a trick of biology
to make us procreate? Is it all we need? Do we need it at all? If romantic love has a purpose, neither science nor psychology
has discovered it yet. But over the course of history, some of our most respected philosophers
have put forward some intriguing theories. Love makes us whole, again. The ancient Greek philosopher Plato explored the idea that we love
in order to become complete. In his "Symposium",
he wrote about a dinner party, at which Aristophanes, a comic playwright, regales the guests 
with the following story: humans were once creatures with four arms,
four legs, and two faces. One day, they angered the gods, and Zeus sliced them all in two. Since then, every person has been missing
half of him or herself. Love is the longing to find a soulmate
who'll make us feel whole again, or, at least, that's what Plato believed
a drunken comedian would say at a party. Love tricks us into having babies. Much, much later, German philosopher
Arthur Schopenhauer maintained that love 
based in sexual desire was a voluptuous illusion. He suggested that we love because
our desires lead us to believe that another person will make us happy,
but we are sorely mistaken. Nature is tricking us into procreating, and the loving fusion we seek
is consummated in our children. When our sexual desires are satisfied, we are thrown back 
into our tormented existences, and we succeed only in maintaining
the species and perpetuating the cycle 
of human drudgery. Sounds like somebody needs a hug. Love is escape from our loneliness. According to the Nobel Prize-winning
British philosopher Bertrand Russell, we love in order to quench
our physical and psychological desires. Humans are designed to procreate, but without the ecstasy 
of passionate love, sex is unsatisfying. Our fear of the cold, cruel world
tempts us to build hard shells to protect and isolate ourselves. Love's delight, intimacy, and warmth
helps us overcome our fear of the world, escape our lonely shells, and engage more abundantly in life. Love enriches our whole being,
making it the best thing in life. Love is a misleading affliction. Siddhārtha Gautama, who became known as the Buddha,
or the Enlightened One, probably would have had some interesting
arguments with Russell. Buddha proposed that we love because
we are trying to satisfy our base desires. Yet, our passionate cravings are defects, and attachments, even romantic love,
are a great source of suffering. Luckily, Buddha discovered 
the eight-fold path, a sort of program for 
extinguishing the fires of desire so that we can reach Nirvana, an enlightened state of peace, clarity,
wisdom, and compassion. The novelist Cao Xueqin illustrated
this Buddhist sentiment that romantic love is folly in 
one of China's greatest classical novels, "Dream of the Red Chamber." In a subplot, Jia Rui 
falls in love with Xi-feng who tricks and humiliates him. Conflicting emotions of love and hate
tear him apart, so a Taoist gives him a magic mirror
that can cure him as long as he doesn't 
look at the front of it. But of course, 
he looks at the front of it. He sees Xi-feng. His soul enters the mirror and he is dragged away 
in iron chains to die. Not all Buddhists think this way
about romantic and erotic love, but the moral of this story is that such attachments
spell tragedy, and should, along with magic mirrors,
be avoided. Love lets us reach beyond ourselves. Let's end on a slightly 
more positive note. The French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir proposed that love is the desire
to integrate with another and that it infuses our lives
with meaning. However, she was less 
concerned with why we love and more interested 
in how we can love better. She saw that the problem
with traditional romantic love is it can be so captivating, that we are tempted to make it
our only reason for being. Yet, dependence on another 
to justify our existence easily leads to boredom and power games. To avoid this trap, Beauvoir advised
loving authentically, which is more like a great friendship. Lovers support each other 
in discovering themselves, reaching beyond themselves, and enriching their lives
and the world together. Though we might never know
why we fall in love, we can be certain that it will be
an emotional rollercoaster ride. It's scary and exhilarating. It makes us suffer and makes us soar. Maybe we lose ourselves. Maybe we find ourselves. It might be heartbreaking, or it might just be 
the best thing in life. Will you dare to find out?

- When you get to space, because you're in a zero G environment, some really funky things
happen to your body. (upbeat music) I grew an inch. Right now, I'm 5'11" but in
space I was six-feet tall. On the ground, gravity
compresses your spine, it pulls you down, the
force factor going down. In space, without gravity
pulling your spine down, every vertebrae has a chance to move up, which gives you your extra inch of height. After my spine elongated, when I went to bed on the first night, I felt some back pain,
some lower back pain, and so I actually curled up to
kind of alleviate that pain, to kind of stretch it out even more. A few other ways the
body can change in space are the heart gets
smaller and changes shape because it's not having to pump
as hard to pull the blood up from your feet, 'cause now things are
just floating and working inside your body so it's pumping easier, therefore the muscle walls
actually changes the shape and they get smaller. Without gravity, your
bones, they change shape and they lose calcium, and
they become more brittle. So, we run on a treadmill that
you strap yourself down to and you run on the treadmill
to actually give loads into your bones to keep
them from atrophying and losing bone density or calcium. For some people in space,
your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you
to wear glasses in space, so it effects your vision. So, we keep different
prescriptions of glasses on board just in case
someone's vision changes. Any changes in our bodies and anything that happens in space, it's worth it for the
spirit of exploration.

**Transcript**:
- When you get to space, because you're in a zero G environment, some really funky things
happen to your body. (upbeat music) I grew an inch. Right now, I'm 5'11" but in
space I was six-feet tall. On the ground, gravity
compresses your spine, it pulls you down, the
force factor going down. In space, without gravity
pulling your spine down, every vertebrae has a chance to move up, which gives you your extra inch of height. After my spine elongated, when I went to bed on the first night, I felt some back pain,
some lower back pain, and so I actually curled up to
kind of alleviate that pain, to kind of stretch it out even more. A few other ways the
body can change in space are the heart gets
smaller and changes shape because it's not having to pump
as hard to pull the blood up from your feet, 'cause now things are
just floating and working inside your body so it's pumping easier, therefore the muscle walls
actually changes the shape and they get smaller. Without gravity, your
bones, they change shape and they lose calcium, and
they become more brittle. So, we run on a treadmill that
you strap yourself down to and you run on the treadmill
to actually give loads into your bones to keep
them from atrophying and losing bone density or calcium. For some people in space,
your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you
to wear glasses in space, so it effects your vision. So, we keep different
prescriptions of glasses on board just in case
someone's vision changes. Any changes in our bodies and anything that happens in space, it's worth it for the
spirit of exploration.

**Transcript**:
- When you get to space, because you're in a zero G environment, some really funky things
happen to your body. (upbeat music) I grew an inch. Right now, I'm 5'11" but in
space I was six-feet tall. On the ground, gravity
compresses your spine, it pulls you down, the
force factor going down. In space, without gravity
pulling your spine down, every vertebrae has a chance to move up, which gives you your extra inch of height. After my spine elongated, when I went to bed on the first night, I felt some back pain,
some lower back pain, and so I actually curled up to
kind of alleviate that pain, to kind of stretch it out even more. A few other ways the
body can change in space are the heart gets
smaller and changes shape because it's not having to pump
as hard to pull the blood up from your feet, 'cause now things are
just floating and working inside your body so it's pumping easier, therefore the muscle walls
actually changes the shape and they get smaller. Without gravity, your
bones, they change shape and they lose calcium, and
they become more brittle. So, we run on a treadmill that
you strap yourself down to and you run on the treadmill
to actually give loads into your bones to keep
them from atrophying and losing bone density or calcium. For some people in space,
your intracranial pressure changes with pushes on your eyeball and that changes its shape, therefore requiring you
to wear glasses in space, so it effects your vision. So, we keep different
prescriptions of glasses on board just in case
someone's vision changes. Any changes in our bodies and anything that happens in space, it's worth it for the
spirit of exploration.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: 5. Some people have to wear glasses while in space, but not on Earth. Why?
Options: A. The light decreases and glasses help them see better., B. Intercranial pressure decreases., C. Their eyeballs change shape., D. It keeps their eyeballs from crossing.

**Transcript**:
After the French Revolution 
erupted in 1789, Europe was thrown into chaos. Neighboring countries' monarchs feared
they would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust
between factions lead to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged 
to take charge of France. But did he save the revolution
or destroy it? "Order, order, who's the defendant today?
I don't see anyone." "Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded 
nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal 
stature-based insecurities." "Actually, Napoléon was 
at least average height for his time. The idea that he was short comes
only from British wartime propaganda. And he was no tyrant. He was safeguarding the young Republic
from being crushed by the European monarchies." "By overthrowing its government
and seizing power himself?" "Your Honor, as a young and successful
military officer, Napoléon fully supported 
the French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. But the revolutionaries were incapable
of real leadership. Robespierre and the Jacobins
who first came to power unleashed a reign of terror
on the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone
who disagreed with them. And The Directory that replaced them
was an unstable and incompetent oligarchy. They needed a strong leader who could
govern wisely and justly." "So, France went through 
that whole revolution just to end up with 
another all-powerful ruler?" "Not quite. Napoléon's new powers were derived
from the constitution that was approved by a popular vote
in the Consulate." "Ha! The constitution was practically dictated
at gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired 
of constant civil war." "Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution
and a legal code that kept some of the most important
achievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men." "All men, indeed. He deprived women of the rights
that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery
in the French colonies. Haiti is still recovering from 
the consequences centuries later. What kind of equality is that?" "The only kind that could be stably
maintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors." "Speaking of neighbors, what was with
all the invasions?" "Great question, Your Honor." "Which invasions are we talking about? It was the neighboring empires
who had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty
across Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge. Having defended France as a soldier
and a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense
is a good offense." "An offense against the entire continent? Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized
the new French Regime. But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless 
he had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting. He tried to enforce a European-wide
blockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars 
to hold onto his gains. And what was the result? Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole 
international order shattered." "You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic 
and liberal ideals across Europe. It was thanks to Napoléon that
the continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented
feudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, 
and secular nation states where the people held more power
and rights than ever before." "Should we also thank him
for the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes? You can see how well that turned out
a century later." "So what would European history have been
like if it weren't for Napoléon?" "Unimaginably better/worse." Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum
would die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army. But even after being deposed
and exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching
a bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second
and final time. Bonaparte was 
a ruler full of contradictions, defending a popular revolution
by imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals
through imperial wars, and though he never achieved his dream
of conquering Europe, he undoubtedly left his mark on it,
for better or for worse.

**Transcript**:
After the French Revolution 
erupted in 1789, Europe was thrown into chaos. Neighboring countries' monarchs feared
they would share the fate of Louis XVI, and attacked the New Republic, while at home, extremism and mistrust
between factions lead to bloodshed. In the midst of all this conflict, a powerful figure emerged 
to take charge of France. But did he save the revolution
or destroy it? "Order, order, who's the defendant today?
I don't see anyone." "Your Honor, this is Napoléon Bonaparte, the tyrant who invaded 
nearly all of Europe to compensate for his personal 
stature-based insecurities." "Actually, Napoléon was 
at least average height for his time. The idea that he was short comes
only from British wartime propaganda. And he was no tyrant. He was safeguarding the young Republic
from being crushed by the European monarchies." "By overthrowing its government
and seizing power himself?" "Your Honor, as a young and successful
military officer, Napoléon fully supported 
the French Revolution, and its ideals of liberty, equality,
and fraternity. But the revolutionaries were incapable
of real leadership. Robespierre and the Jacobins
who first came to power unleashed a reign of terror
on the population, with their anti-Catholic extremism and nonstop executions of everyone
who disagreed with them. And The Directory that replaced them
was an unstable and incompetent oligarchy. They needed a strong leader who could
govern wisely and justly." "So, France went through 
that whole revolution just to end up with 
another all-powerful ruler?" "Not quite. Napoléon's new powers were derived
from the constitution that was approved by a popular vote
in the Consulate." "Ha! The constitution was practically dictated
at gunpoint in a military coup, and the public only accepted the tyrant because they were tired 
of constant civil war." "Be that as it may, Napoléon introduced a new constitution
and a legal code that kept some of the most important
achievements of the revolution in tact: freedom of religion abolition of hereditary privilege, and equality before the law for all men." "All men, indeed. He deprived women of the rights
that the revolution had given them and even reinstated slavery
in the French colonies. Haiti is still recovering from 
the consequences centuries later. What kind of equality is that?" "The only kind that could be stably
maintained at the time, and still far ahead of France's neighbors." "Speaking of neighbors, what was with
all the invasions?" "Great question, Your Honor." "Which invasions are we talking about? It was the neighboring empires
who had invaded France trying to restore the monarchy, and prevent the spread of liberty
across Europe, twice by the time Napoléon took charge. Having defended France as a soldier
and a general in those wars, he knew that the best defense
is a good offense." "An offense against the entire continent? Peace was secured by 1802, and other European powers recognized
the new French Regime. But Bonaparte couldn't rest unless 
he had control of the whole continent, and all he knew was fighting. He tried to enforce a European-wide
blockade of Britain, invaded any country that didn't comply, and launched more wars 
to hold onto his gains. And what was the result? Millions dead all over the continent, and the whole 
international order shattered." "You forgot the other result: the spread of democratic 
and liberal ideals across Europe. It was thanks to Napoléon that
the continent was reshaped from a chaotic patchwork of fragmented
feudal and religious territories into efficient, modern, 
and secular nation states where the people held more power
and rights than ever before." "Should we also thank him
for the rise of nationalism and the massive increase in army sizes? You can see how well that turned out
a century later." "So what would European history have been
like if it weren't for Napoléon?" "Unimaginably better/worse." Napoléon seemingly unstoppable momentum
would die in the Russian winter snows, along with most of his army. But even after being deposed
and exiled, he refused to give up, escaping from his prison and launching
a bold attempt at restoring his empire before being defeated for the second
and final time. Bonaparte was 
a ruler full of contradictions, defending a popular revolution
by imposing absolute dictatorship, and spreading liberal ideals
through imperial wars, and though he never achieved his dream
of conquering Europe, he undoubtedly left his mark on it,
for better or for worse.

**Transcript**:
Where does bread get its fluffiness? Swiss cheese its holes? And what makes vinegar so sour? These foods may taste 
completely different, but all of these phenomena come from
tiny organisms chowing down on sugar and belching up some culinary byproducts. Let's start with yeast. Yeast are single-celled fungi 
used to make bread, beer, and wine, among other products. Yeast break down carbohydrates,
like sugar, to get energy 
and the molecules they need to function. They have two different ways to do this: the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway, and the oxygen-independent, 
anaerobic pathway, which is also called fermentation. When you bake bread,
yeast can use both pathways, but they normally prefer to start with
the anaerobic process of fermentation. In this process, ethanol is produced
in addition to CO2. No, bread isn't alcoholic. Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted
evaporate during baking. In the aerobic, 
or oxygen-dependent pathway, the yeast consume some of the sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2, and water. In both processes, the CO2 accumulates
and creates tiny bubbles. These bubbles get trapped by gluten
and create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture. Wine also relies on yeast. But a wine-making set-up 
keeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar 
using fermentation, the anaerobic pathway. The process often starts with wild yeasts
already hanging out on the grapes. But to get consistent results, most winemakers also add 
carefully selected strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol. The yeast consume the sugar
in the grape juice, and as the sugar level drops, the alcohol level rises. This doesn't necessarily mean 
that sweeter wines have less alcohol. Different types of grapes start with
different amounts of sugar, and sugar can also be added. What happens to the carbon dioxide? It just bubbles away through a vent. In carbonated alcoholic beverages,
like champagne and beer, sealed containers are used in primary
or secondary fermentation to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle. Wine also introduces us to our second
type of food-producing microorganism: bacteria. A special strain of bacteria turns a tart compound in grape juice
into softer tasting ones that are responsible for some of
the flavors in red wines and chardonnays. Another type of bacteria,
called acetic acid bacteria, isn't so desirable in wine, but they have their function, too. If there's oxygen around, these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine
into, well, acetic acid. Let this process continue
and you'll eventually get vinegar. Bacteria are the key for cheese, too. To make cheese, 
milk is inoculated with bacteria. The bacteria gobble up the lactose,
a kind of sugar, and produce lactic acid,
along with many other chemicals. As the milk gets more and more acidic, its proteins start to aggregate 
and curdle. That's why spoiled milk is clumpy. Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme
called rennet, naturally found inside of cows, goats,
and some other mammals to help this process along. Eventually, those little curdles turn into
bigger curds, which are pressed 
to squeeze out the water, and create a firm cheese. Different strains of bacteria
make different kinds of cheese. For example, a species of bacteria
that emits carbon dioxide is what gives swiss cheese
its characteristic holes. Some cheeses, brie and camembert,
use another kind of microorganism, too: mold. So your kitchen functions as a sort of
biotechnology lab manned by microorganisms 
that culture your cuisine. Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, 
cheddar, challah, pita, and naan. But maybe not all at the same dinner.

like sugar, to get energy 
and the molecules they need to function. They have two different ways to do this: the oxygen-dependent, or aerobic, pathway, and the oxygen-independent, 
anaerobic pathway, which is also called fermentation. When you bake bread,
yeast can use both pathways, but they normally prefer to start with
the anaerobic process of fermentation. In this process, ethanol is produced
in addition to CO2. No, bread isn't alcoholic. Small amounts of alcohol that are secreted
evaporate during baking. In the aerobic, 
or oxygen-dependent pathway, the yeast consume some of the sugar and produce carbon dioxide gas,
or CO2, and water. In both processes, the CO2 accumulates
and creates tiny bubbles. These bubbles get trapped by gluten
and create a sponge-like structure that gives the bread its soft texture. Wine also relies on yeast. But a wine-making set-up 
keeps the oxygen levels low so that yeast consume sugar 
using fermentation, the anaerobic pathway. The process often starts with wild yeasts
already hanging out on the grapes. But to get consistent results, most winemakers also add 
carefully selected strains of yeast that can tolerate high levels of alcohol. The yeast consume the sugar
in the grape juice, and as the sugar level drops, the alcohol level rises. This doesn't necessarily mean 
that sweeter wines have less alcohol. Different types of grapes start with
different amounts of sugar, and sugar can also be added. What happens to the carbon dioxide? It just bubbles away through a vent. In carbonated alcoholic beverages,
like champagne and beer, sealed containers are used in primary
or secondary fermentation to keep the carbon dioxide in the bottle. Wine also introduces us to our second
type of food-producing microorganism: bacteria. A special strain of bacteria turns a tart compound in grape juice
into softer tasting ones that are responsible for some of
the flavors in red wines and chardonnays. Another type of bacteria,
called acetic acid bacteria, isn't so desirable in wine, but they have their function, too. If there's oxygen around, these bacteria convert the ethanol in wine
into, well, acetic acid. Let this process continue
and you'll eventually get vinegar. Bacteria are the key for cheese, too. To make cheese, 
milk is inoculated with bacteria. The bacteria gobble up the lactose,
a kind of sugar, and produce lactic acid,
along with many other chemicals. As the milk gets more and more acidic, its proteins start to aggregate 
and curdle. That's why spoiled milk is clumpy. Cheesemakers usually add an enzyme
called rennet, naturally found inside of cows, goats,
and some other mammals to help this process along. Eventually, those little curdles turn into
bigger curds, which are pressed 
to squeeze out the water, and create a firm cheese. Different strains of bacteria
make different kinds of cheese. For example, a species of bacteria
that emits carbon dioxide is what gives swiss cheese
its characteristic holes. Some cheeses, brie and camembert,
use another kind of microorganism, too: mold. So your kitchen functions as a sort of
biotechnology lab manned by microorganisms 
that culture your cuisine. Yogurt, soy sauce, sour cream, sauerkraut, kefir, kimchi, kombucha, 
cheddar, challah, pita, and naan. But maybe not all at the same dinner.
