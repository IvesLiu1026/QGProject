let's say Jack holds both balls above his head and then he drops them at exactly the same time what do you expect to see well they're going to hit the ground at the same time I expect them to both land at the same time the same time same time this one to hit the ground first however they will actually both hit the ground at the same time why is that science yeah science now the black one clearly feels a lot heavier so the standard misconception is to believe that the black ball will accelerate at a greater rate and reach the ground first this year many people had an idea that both balls would land at the same time but they didn't know exactly why I found there were some different misconceptions for example many people seem to think that as an object falls towards the Earth it falls with a constant speed from this hot yeah pretty much just a constant speed all the way down speed yeah I think it'll be the same constant speed I think it's constant I seem to remember it being constant I did decently in physics and I se to remember that's the answer whereas the truth is the speed of both balls is changing all the time the balls are speeding up as they go towards the ground that's what the force of gravity does on them it makes them accelerate it gets them to speed up another misconception I discovered was that some people believe both balls should have the same gravitational force on them even though the black ball is clearly much much heavier the reason I think they said this was because they knew both balls needed to reach the ground at the same time so they reasoned that the force on them must be the same tell me about how the gravitational force on this ball compares to the gravitational force on that ball the force is the same it's going to be very similar in terms of gravitational pool they're both have the same and they'll fall at the same rate I'm not like Einstein but same gravitational force around the whole world right cuz the gravitational pull on the earth is the same on both objects are you saying that the force on them is the same the pull is the same but you felt the pole and you've told me the pole is different no I said the weight is different I didn't say the pole is different it is heavier and has more gravitational pull but when I drop them then they get equal a gravitational pull somehow don't you think it's going to be like five times as much yeah you think but it's not the way you're asking it yes but scientifically speaking no the gravitational force on both these fors are the same okay the gravitational force on both of these BS is the same is that what you actually believe no but it is tell me tell me what you believe I believe it should be more on this simply for the fact that this is heavier and just intuition tells me that should be more but after learning physics we learn that it is actually the same I actually think the force on this ball is more the force on this I I swear I'm not trying to mess with you so like in in real life in real life and in physics I will tell you that the force on this ball is more all right ready three two one yep see same time same time same time I would say the force on the medicine ball is like a lot more because it's got a lot more weight it's got a lot more mass but it's got a lot more inertia yeah yeah oh you guys remember that right it's got a lot of resistance to acceleration so it takes more Force to get it accelerating at the same rate as this ball and that's why they accelerate at the same rate thank you guys so much for playing along I appreciate that sorry it's all right

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10.

Although Question 10's wording is not identical to the ground truth MCQ, its intent and options are similar. Both questions ask about the result of dropping two objects of different weights at the same time in a gravitational field. The correct answer in Question 10 (if the correct option were specified) would be C, which matches the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

However, note that Question 10 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it considers the effects of inertia and gravity, whereas the ground truth MCQ only asks which ball most people thought would hit the ground first.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 10, but with the understanding that it is not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet. It's like a 500 megapixel camera that can run in bright light, in near darkness, and even under water, though not real well. It communicates to our brains so much about the world. Our eyes are how we find partners, how we understand the people around us, how we read, and how we watch game shows on TV where people get knocked into cold water by padded wrecking balls. Yup, the human eye is pretty neat, and we're lucky enough to have two of them. But, there are things that, despite looking really hard, we still can't quite see. For example, you can watch a horse galloping, but your eyes can't keep up with its fast-moving hooves enough to figure out whether all four feet are ever off the ground simultaneously. For these types of questions, we need cameras. About 150 years ago, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge used one to solve the galloping horse mystery. Using careful photography, Muybridge proved that at certain points as it gallops, a horse really is flying. "Look, ma! No hooves!" Since then, photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science. It enhances our understanding of a world we thought we could already see, but it's one which we really need help to see a little better. It's not always a matter of the world moving by too quickly for our eyes to process. Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements that are too small for the naked eye. Botanists use multiple photographs to show the life cycle of plants and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours to follow the sun in what is called phototropism, growing towards the light. Mathematicians have used photos to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier. Meteorologists and environmental scientists show the growth of major hurricanes and the recession over the years of many of the world's glaciers. Slow-motion film or high-speed photography have shown us the beating of a hummingbird's wings and the course of a bullet through its target. In one project, cadavers, that's dead bodies, were frozen and sliced into thousands of wafer-thin discs. The discs were photographed to produced animated movies that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton, and into the flesh, and through the bones, and the veins, and, perhaps I should have suggested you don't watch this during dinner, my bad. In classrooms today, the camera, now present in just about every phone and computer, allows the youngest scientists to observe the world around them, to document it, and to share their findings online. Whether it's the change of seasons or the growth of the germinating seed, cameras are allowing us to see a beautiful world through new eyes.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What type of scientists use multiple photographs to show the life cycle of plants? 

However, the options provided in Question 8 do not include the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the type of scientist who studies hurricanes.

Since there isn't a direct match, the closest generated MCQ in terms of intent would be Question 8, but with an important caveat: it does not directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the type of scientist who studies hurricanes. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

However, among the given options, Question 8 is the closest in terms of discussing the role of scientists, even though it's about botanists and not specifically about the scientists who study hurricanes.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe, rather beautiful, isn't it? It's quite literally got everything, from the very big to the very small. Sure, there are some less
than savory elements in there, but on the whole,
scholars agree that its existence is probably a good thing. Such a good thing that
an entire field of scientific endeavor is devoted to its study. This is known as cosmology. Cosmologists look
at what's out there in space and piece together the tale
of how our universe evolved: what it's doing now, what it's going to be doing, and how it all began in the first place. It was Edwin Hubble who first noticed
that our universe is expanding, by noting that galaxies seem to be flying
further and further apart. This implied that everything
should have started with the monumental explosion of an infinitely hot, infinitely small point. This idea was jokingly
referred to at the time as the "Big Bang," but as the evidence piled up, the notion and the name actually stuck. We know that after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down to form the stars and galaxies
that we see today. Cosmologists have plenty of ideas
about how this happened. But we can also probe
the origins of the universe by recreating the hot, dense conditions
that existed at the beginning of time in the laboratory. This is done by particle physicists. Over the past century, particle physicists have been studying matter and forces
at higher and higher energies. Firstly with cosmic rays, and then with particle accelerators, machines that smash together
subatomic particles at great energies. The greater the energy of the accelerator, the further back in time
they can effectively peek. Today, things are largely
made up of atoms, but hundreds of seconds
after the Big Bang, it was too hot for electrons to join
atomic nuclei to make atoms. Instead, the universe consisted
of a swirling sea of subatomic matter. A few seconds after the Big Bang, it was hotter still, hot enough to overpower the forces that usually hold protons
and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. Further back, microseconds
after the Big Bang, and the protons and neutrons were only just beginning
to form from quarks, one of the fundamental building blocks of the standard model of particle physics. Further back still, and the energy was too great
even for the quarks to stick together. Physicists hope that by going
to even greater energies, they can see back to a time
when all the forces were one and the same, which would make understanding the origins of the universe a lot easier. To do that, they'll not only need
to build bigger colliders, but also work hard
to combine our knowledge of the very, very big with the very, very small and share these fascinating
insights with each other and with, well, you. And that's how it should be! Because, after all,
when it comes to our universe, we're all in this one together.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What was the state of the universe hundreds of seconds after the Big Bang? 

However, the correct answer in Question 7 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match is Question 8: What are the fundamental building blocks of the standard model of particle physics that formed microseconds after the Big Bang? 

But the correct match is actually Question 7's preceding statement in the transcript that mentioned protons and neutrons forming from quarks, microseconds after the Big Bang.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 7 is the closest in terms of the timeline after the Big Bang, and Question 8 mentions the formation of protons and neutrons from quarks, the best match is not ideal.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest match.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How do we know that all of the fundamental forces of nature will simplify into one force at a very high energy?
Options: A. All of the experimental evidence we have obtained so far suggests that some of the different forces we know about are actually the same force if you go to high enough energies, and we expect this trend to continue., B. The physics of the universe must be described by a simple, elegant mathematical equation – and one force is simpler than four forces., C. We don’t know this at all – if we want to test this hypothesis, we’ll have to build bigger particle accelerators to further our understanding of the universe.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9. 

Although Question 9 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, it shares a similar intent, which is to understand the origins of the universe by studying higher energies. The correct option for the ground truth MCQ mentions that experimental evidence suggests that different forces may be the same at high energies, and this trend is expected to continue. Similarly, Question 9 implies that physicists are working to understand the origins of the universe by building bigger colliders and studying higher energies.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Music] I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is

thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more

success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity

my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today

mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is the main challenge in treating brain disorders with pharmaceuticals? Options: A. The brain is too complex to understand, B. The drugs have too many side effects, C. The brain is bathed in a chemical, making it difficult to target specific cells, D. The drugs are not potent enough**

This generated MCQ is similar to the ground truth MCQ in that it addresses the challenges of treating brain disorders, which is related to the reason why research is finding ways to turn circuits and cells of the brain on and off. However, the options and the specific focus of the question are not an exact match.

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about the purpose or goal of turning circuits and cells of the brain on and off, which is not present in the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 5: What is the purpose of using light to activate cells in the brain? Options: A. To understand the brain's electrical signals, B. To develop new treatments for brain disorders, C. To enhance cognitive function, D. To control the brain's activity**

However, this question is still not a perfect match, as it focuses on the purpose of using light to activate cells, rather than the broader goal of turning circuits and cells of the brain on and off.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is **5**, with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells

platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about

epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar There has never been a time to make things as good as right now. Between what's available on the Internet, like the stuff on YouTube, the stuff on Instructables, MAKE Magazine, between the quality of your teachers who know so much and the incredible availability of parts, and tools, and supplies, there's almost nothing that you can't make, almost nothing you can't make, if you really try. Now in my career, I've made a lot of stuff. I've made telescopes, I've made microscopes, I know people who made electron microscopes. I personally made flamethrowers. I made a four-story high trebuchet. Um, I've made some really dangerous stuff. My favorite is I made a battlebot when battlebots were kind of big. You know, it was metal, it had 20 horsepower motors, it had a carbon-tip fireman cut-off saw in the front. That thing could, you know, eat its way out of a steel room. I've made just so many things. But not everything you have to make is dangerous to be cool. The point is, is that it's just fun to make stuff and if you've got a really good idea, you could probably do it. Now, there are different styles of making things. There's Do It Yourself and that's like, "Well, I'm going to fix the brakes on my car or put siding on my house," and that's an interesting kind of DIY. But there's hacking, where you take one item that's purposed for something else and turn it into something, you know, cooler, something different. There's bricolage, which means making things from found objects. There's kitting, which means you buy a kit, something complicated, probably, and put it together. And there's inventing, and inventing is the best! The best kind of making things involves not just following directions from people who have done things before, but actually going out there, figuring out how to make something, doing the design yourself, and then actually building it. Now, I don't have a lot of time, but I want to get you started on your own invention project, maybe. So what I'm going to do live and real-time and something that scares me, is, because it is live and real-time, is I'm going to make an audio speaker out of stuff that I found in my kitchen on the night before I came to New York. Okay. So what I've got here is a block of wood. I've got some sand paper. I've got some pieces of notebook paper folded up into a rough "Z" shape. I've got two magnets. And, I've got some wire. Now, this wire is the key part. The four things that I need to make my own speaker is a diaphragm, a coil, a support, and a magnet. So first thing's first. Let's start doing it. What I need to do is wind a coil. And what I'm going to do is take this wire and wind an entire voice coil from it. Now, unfortunately that's going to take a really long time, and I don't have much time, so I'm just going to give you the flavor of it. I'm going to take 30 gauge magnet wire and I'm just going to wrap it tightly together, and I'm going to do about 150 turns on a 3/4 inch wooden dowel. Now why would I do that? Because I want to get my coil to have about 4 ohms of resistance. If you don't have enough resistance, you can do something bad to your amplifier. And then once that's done, I'm going to glue it all together so it's nice and tight. Now I don't nearly have 150 coils there so I made one in advance and I'm going to use that one. So where is it? Here it is. What I'm going to do is simply hot glue it to the back of this yogurt cup. And I had to eat a lot of yogurt while I was experimenting, so I feel like I've got all the calcium I need for a while. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is take these magnets and glue it in the center of this dot. Hot glue, by the way, a hot glue gun, it's the greatest maker toy you can possibly have. I don't care what the 3-D prototype guys say, I love my hot glue gun! What I'm going to do next is take these little "Z" stand-offs, see? And I'm going to put some glue there. Look how fast that bonds! My god, this is great stuff! And I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to glue this. And I'm going to center that coil right over those magnets so it's just above it. And now it's done. Now this needs to dry. So you know how Martha Stewart would take the cake out of the oven, it's pre-made? We're going to do that, we're going to go to the Martha Stewart one. So this is the one I made earlier today. And it's the yogurt cup, the stand-offs, and everything else. Well, I'm going to turn on my iPod. We'll see if we get some music. I need a microphone. Hello? It's on, good deal. So, let's play something. [Music plays.] Now this is really coming from a yogurt cup and it's kind of a neat deal. Might not be your choice of music. Now you can experiment with different things. In fact, I did. Last night I did this. Let me walk over here. I made all these different speakers out of different things. Here's one. Because I'm in New York, I made one out of a piece of matzo. I made one out of a coffee cup lid. I made one out of a Tostito. The Tostito looks like a speaker, doesn't it? So, you can imagine how good that works. And then last night during rehearsals they gave us some food, and they gave us these thick potato chips. You've got to hear this, you guys. This is just incredible how nice that sounds. [Music plays.] It's just incredible. So anyway, like I said, today is the very best time, this age is the very best time to be a maker. You can make so many things if you put your mind to it. Get out there, pick something up because, I'll tell you, the stuff you make, the stuff you make is way better than the stuff you buy. It's special, it's significant to you, and I really encourage you to do that. Thanks a lot for listening to me.

**Question 3: What style of making things involves taking an item and turning it into something different or cooler? Options: A. DIY (Do It Yourself), B. Hacking, C. Bricolage, D. Kitting**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the styles of making things mentioned by the speaker and includes an option that is not mentioned, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on the content and options, I would suggest:

**Question 4: What is the term for making things from found objects? Options: A. DIY (Do It Yourself), B. Hacking, C. Bricolage, D. Kitting**

This question is related to the styles of making things mentioned by the speaker, but it does not include an option that is not mentioned, like the ground truth MCQ.

To create a more suitable match, I would suggest generating a new question that includes an option that is not mentioned by the speaker, such as:

**Question: Which of the following is not a style of making things mentioned by the speaker? Options: A. DIY (Do It Yourself), B. Hacking, C. Bricolage, D. Fine Art**

This question would more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Since I have to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would suggest:

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, the closest match would be a question that involves the process of making things, specifically the best kind of making things.

The ground truth MCQ mentions that the best kind of making things involves designing and building. Among the generated MCQs, none directly address this concept. However, Question 3 mentions hacking as a style of making things that involves taking an item and turning it into something different or cooler, which involves some form of designing and building.

But a more relevant question would be one that distinguishes between the different styles of making things mentioned in the transcript, such as DIY, hacking, bricolage, kitting, and inventing. The speaker mentions that inventing is the best kind of making things, which involves designing and building.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. However, I suggest generating new MCQs that directly address the concept of designing and building as the best kind of making things. 

Here is an example of a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:
Question: According to the speaker, what is the best kind of making things?
Options: A. DIY (Do It Yourself), B. Hacking, C. Bricolage, D. Inventining
Correct Option: D

Or

And now it's done. Now this needs to dry. So you know how Martha Stewart would take the cake out of the oven, it's pre-made? We're going to do that, we're going to go to the Martha Stewart one. So this is the one I made earlier today. And it's the yogurt cup, the stand-offs, and everything else. Well, I'm going to turn on my iPod. We'll see if we get some music. I need a microphone. Hello? It's on, good deal. So, let's play something. [Music plays.] Now this is really coming from a yogurt cup and it's kind of a neat deal. Might not be your choice of music. Now you can experiment with different things. In fact, I did. Last night I did this. Let me walk over here. I made all these different speakers out of different things. Here's one. Because I'm in New York, I made one out of a piece of matzo. I made one out of a coffee cup lid. I made one out of a Tostito. The Tostito looks like a speaker, doesn't it? So, you can imagine how good that works. And then last night during rehearsals they gave us some food, and they gave us these thick potato chips. You've got to hear this, you guys. This is just incredible how nice that sounds. [Music plays.] It's just incredible. So anyway, like I said, today is the very best time, this age is the very best time to be a maker. You can make so many things if you put your mind to it. Get out there, pick something up because, I'll tell you, the stuff you make, the stuff you make is way better than the stuff you buy. It's special, it's significant to you, and I really encourage you to do that. Thanks a lot for listening to me.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar There has never been a time to make things as good as right now. Between what's available on the Internet, like the stuff on YouTube, the stuff on Instructables, MAKE Magazine, between the quality of your teachers who know so much and the incredible availability of parts, and tools, and supplies, there's almost nothing that you can't make, almost nothing you can't make, if you really try. Now in my career, I've made a lot of stuff. I've made telescopes, I've made microscopes, I know people who made electron microscopes. I personally made flamethrowers. I made a four-story high trebuchet. Um, I've made some really dangerous stuff. My favorite is I made a battlebot when battlebots were kind of big. You know, it was metal, it had 20 horsepower motors, it had a carbon-tip fireman cut-off saw in the front. That thing could, you know, eat its way out of a steel room. I've made just so many things. But not everything you have to make is dangerous to be cool. The point is, is that it's just fun to make stuff and if you've got a really good idea, you could probably do it. Now, there are different styles of making things. There's Do It Yourself and that's like, "Well, I'm going to fix the brakes on my car or put siding on my house," and that's an interesting kind of DIY. But there's hacking, where you take one item that's purposed for something else and turn it into something, you know, cooler, something different. There's bricolage, which means making things from found objects. There's kitting, which means you buy a kit, something complicated, probably, and put it together. And there's inventing, and inventing is the best! The best kind of making things involves not just following directions from people who have done things before, but actually going out there, figuring out how to make something, doing the design yourself, and then actually building it. Now, I don't have a lot of time, but I want to get you started on your own invention project, maybe. So what I'm going to do live and real-time and something that scares me, is, because it is live and real-time, is I'm going to make an audio speaker out of stuff that I found in my kitchen on the night before I came to New York. Okay. So what I've got here is a block of wood. I've got some sand paper. I've got some pieces of notebook paper folded up into a rough "Z" shape. I've got two magnets. And, I've got some wire. Now, this wire is the key part. The four things that I need to make my own speaker is a diaphragm, a coil, a support, and a magnet. So first thing's first. Let's start doing it. What I need to do is wind a coil. And what I'm going to do is take this wire and wind an entire voice coil from it. Now, unfortunately that's going to take a really long time, and I don't have much time, so I'm just going to give you the flavor of it. I'm going to take 30 gauge magnet wire and I'm just going to wrap it tightly together, and I'm going to do about 150 turns on a 3/4 inch wooden dowel. Now why would I do that? Because I want to get my coil to have about 4 ohms of resistance. If you don't have enough resistance, you can do something bad to your amplifier. And then once that's done, I'm going to glue it all together so it's nice and tight. Now I don't nearly have 150 coils there so I made one in advance and I'm going to use that one. So where is it? Here it is. What I'm going to do is simply hot glue it to the back of this yogurt cup. And I had to eat a lot of yogurt while I was experimenting, so I feel like I've got all the calcium I need for a while. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is take these magnets and glue it in the center of this dot. Hot glue, by the way, a hot glue gun, it's the greatest maker toy you can possibly have. I don't care what the 3-D prototype guys say, I love my hot glue gun! What I'm going to do next is take these little "Z" stand-offs, see? And I'm going to put some glue there. Look how fast that bonds! My god, this is great stuff! And I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to glue this. And I'm going to center that coil right over those magnets so it's just above it. And now it's done. Now this needs to dry. So you know how Martha Stewart would take the cake out of the oven, it's pre-made? We're going to do that, we're going to go to the Martha Stewart one. So this is the one I made earlier today. And it's the yogurt cup, the stand-offs, and everything else. Well, I'm going to turn on my iPod. We'll see if we get some music. I need a microphone. Hello? It's on, good deal. So, let's play something. [Music plays.] Now this is really coming from a yogurt cup and it's kind of a neat deal. Might not be your choice of music. Now you can experiment with different things. In fact, I did. Last night I did this. Let me walk over here. I made all these different speakers out of different things. Here's one.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the connection between the commedia dell'arte merchant character and Venice.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 6: What was the name of the miserly Venetian merchant character in commedia dell'arte?**

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ, but it does not directly ask about the connection between the character and Venice.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

**Question 6**

But please note that this is not a perfect match.

After re-reading the questions, I noticed that Question 6 is not the best match. 

A better match would be a question that mentions the patron saint of Venice or the reason why the commedia dell'arte merchant character is from Venice.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this topic. However, I can suggest a better match:

**Question 4: Who was the Roman Catholic saint associated with the origin of the word "pants"?**

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions the Roman Catholic saint who is the patron saint of Venice.

So, the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4**

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you to one of the most amazing scientists who have ever lived. So famous, that more places on Earth have been named after him than any human being. So famous, that President Thomas Jefferson said he was the most important scientist he ever met. And Simon Bolivar called him the true discoverer of South America. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, every story on the front page of The New York Times was written about him. Who is this scientist and what did he do that was so extraordinary? His name is Alexander Von Humboldt. Never heard of him? Most people haven't. His name has been lost in history, but here is what he did. Alexander Von Humboldt started as a practicing geologist, but when an inheritance allowed him the freedom to travel, he began an incredible, five-year scientific journey through South America, Mexico, and Cuba. From 1799 to 1804, Von Humboldt and his botonist partner, Aime Bonpland, traveled through the jungles of Venezuela, made detailed drawings of Inca ruins while exploring the mountains of Peru, and traversed the breadth of Mexico and Cuba. He explored the length of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. This 1700 mile portion of the trip was filled with danger, disease, and fantastic new discoveries. For example, Von Humboldt was the first explorer to witness the preparation of the curare plant for poison arrows. He recognized the importance of the cinchona tree, whose bark contains quinine, which is a malaria cure, and discovered the ocean current, which limits rainfall on the coast of Peru, later named the Humboldt Current. He discovered and described many new species of plants and animals, including the electric eel. In Ecuador, he climbed the one of the highest volcanoes, Chimborazo, so that he could record air pressure, something no one had ever done at this altitude. The entire journey covered over 24,000 miles, the same distance as the circumference of the Earth. Along the way, he took measurements about the shape of the land, its temperature, the air pressure, and the strength of magnetic fields. By connecting places of identical temperatures, he created contour maps with lines of similar temperatures, which he called "isotherms". Because Humboldt invented these maps, scientists began to see patterns in the life and the types of life present in certain places, and he became a pioneer in the visual presentation of scientific data. These discoveries and measurements were critical to what made him such an important scientist. Until Humboldt, scientists who described new plants and animals did not clearly see the crucial connection between living things and the places in which they lived, called habitats. They did not appreciate the role of the environment on the diversity of life. Humboldt discovered and understood the importance of these connections. Because of this, he is considered the founder of biogeography. He also developed a theory called the "Unity of Nature," which shows the interconnectedness of all nature. This knowledge plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of our habitat. His book, Cosmos, describes this theory and is still in print today. As celebrated a scientist as he was, Von Humboldt was also generous, thus serving another role in the world. He was the mentor and teacher to younger scientists. In fact, just recently it was discovered the crucial role that Humboldt played in the work of his most famous pen-pal, Charles Darwin. A young Darwin read Humboldt extensively and wrote in his diary while on the Beagle, "I am at present fit only to read Humboldt. He, like another sun, illuminates everything I behold." Today, although Humboldt is known and revered by a small community of scientists, he is almost totally forgotten by many of us. Alexander Von Humboldt's influence is apparent everywhere and in every scientific discipline. He is, perhaps, the most important forgotten man of science. But he doesn't have to be, because if you remember him, perhaps his influence will be celebrated.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can infer that the most similar generated MCQ would be one that mentions Alexander Von Humboldt's initial profession or area of study.

From the transcript, we know that Alexander Von Humboldt "started as a practicing geologist." This information is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about Humboldt's initial type of scientist.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic. However, Question 7: What is Alexander Von Humboldt considered the founder of? Options: A. Biogeography, B. Geology, C. Botany, D. Zoology, is the closest in terms of relevance to Humboldt's scientific background.

Therefore, I would choose Question 7 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you to one of the most amazing scientists who have ever lived. So famous, that more places on Earth have been named after him than any human being. So famous, that President Thomas Jefferson said he was the most important scientist he ever met. And Simon Bolivar called him the true discoverer of South America. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, every story on the front page of The New York Times was written about him. Who is this scientist and what did he do that was so extraordinary? His name is Alexander Von Humboldt. Never heard of him? Most people haven't. His name has been lost in history, but here is what he did. Alexander Von Humboldt started as a practicing geologist, but when an inheritance allowed him the freedom to travel, he began an incredible, five-year scientific journey through South America, Mexico, and Cuba. From 1799 to 1804, Von Humboldt and his botonist partner, Aime Bonpland, traveled through the jungles of Venezuela, made detailed drawings of Inca ruins while exploring the mountains of Peru, and traversed the breadth of Mexico and Cuba. He explored the length of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. This 1700 mile portion of the trip was filled with danger, disease, and fantastic new discoveries. For example, Von Humboldt was the first explorer to witness the preparation of the curare plant for poison arrows. He recognized the importance of the cinchona tree, whose bark contains quinine, which is a malaria cure, and discovered the ocean current, which limits rainfall on the coast of Peru, later named the Humboldt Current. He discovered and described many new species of plants and animals, including the electric eel. In Ecuador, he climbed the one of the highest volcanoes, Chimborazo, so that he could record air pressure, something no one had ever done at this altitude. The entire journey covered over 24,000 miles, the same distance as the circumference of the Earth. Along the way, he took measurements about the shape of the land, its temperature, the air pressure, and the strength of magnetic fields. By connecting places of identical temperatures, he created contour maps with lines of similar temperatures, which he called "isotherms". Because Humboldt invented these maps, scientists began to see patterns in the life and the types of life present in certain places, and he became a pioneer in the visual presentation of scientific data. These discoveries and measurements were critical to what made him such an important scientist. Until Humboldt, scientists who described new plants and animals did not clearly see the crucial connection between living things and the places in which they lived, called habitats. They did not appreciate the role of the environment on the diversity of life. Humboldt discovered and understood the importance of these connections. Because of this, he is considered the founder of biogeography. He also developed a theory called the "Unity of Nature," which shows the interconnectedness of all nature. This knowledge plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of our habitat. His book, Cosmos, describes this theory and is still in print today. As celebrated a scientist as he was, Von Humboldt was also generous, thus serving another role in the world. He was the mentor and teacher to younger scientists. In fact, just recently it was discovered the crucial role that Humboldt played in the work of his most famous pen-pal, Charles Darwin. A young Darwin read Humboldt extensively and wrote in his diary while on the Beagle, "I am at present fit only to read Humboldt. He, like another sun, illuminates everything I behold." Today, although Humboldt is known and revered by a small community of scientists, he is almost totally forgotten by many of us. Alexander Von Humboldt's influence is apparent everywhere and in every scientific discipline. He is, perhaps, the most important forgotten man of science. But he doesn't have to be, because if you remember him, perhaps his influence will be celebrated.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So we live in what I think of as a CSI age where we take for granted that scientists are going to work together with the police, help them solve crimes, map fingerprints, analyze poisons, but in fact, this is really a very new idea. We only actually started training scientists and forensics in this country in the 1930s. So as a writer interested in chemistry, what I wondered was, "What was it like before scientists knew how to tease a poison out of a corpse, before you could actually catch a killer that way?" And it won't surprise you to learn that the answer is pretty dangerous. And in fact, in 1918, New York City issued a report admitting that smart poisoners could operate with impunity in the city. This is a 1918 crime scene photo from Brooklyn, and at this time, the coroner system was so corrupt that you could literally buy your cause of death. Often coroners didn't even show up at crime scenes. And if you go back and you look at the death certificates of the time, I found one that read, "Could be an auto accident or possibly diabetes." And another, which involved a man who shot himself in the head, said, "ruptured aneurysm". So you find, not surprisingly, the police saying, "We're going to look a lot smarter if we stay away from the science side of the story." But, in 1918 New York City appointed the first trained medical examiner it ever had. That's the gentleman sitting down there. And he hired the first forensic toxicologist ever attached to an American city. And together, these two men, Charles Norris, the medical examiner, and Alexander Gettler, the chemist sitting next to him, rewrote the rules of crime detection in this country. And that wasn't easy because poisons were everywhere. If we take this one, arsenic trioxide, arsenic trioxide's probably the most famous homicidal poison in history and it was in every home. Anyone could go to the grocery store or the pharmacy and buy it. It was in every kitchen because, believe it or not, it was used to color food. It was in medicines and it was in cosmetics in ways that prevented people from really understanding how dangerous these poisons were or how they worked. Now, scientists had in the 19th century begun developing tests to look for poisons in corpses. But as this cartoon shows you of the first test for arsenic, these were very primitive tests, so, that our heroes really have to figure this out as they go in the 1920s. Gettler, for instance, was the first person in the world to know how to tell if someone was drunk at time of death. He figured that out right about 1930 and he said later it took him 6,000 brains from the morgue to get to the point that he could get to that answer. And to give you a sense of what this is like, I'm going to ask you for a moment to become 1920s forensic detectives. This is a case based on one solved by Alexander Gettler in 1923, and as you can probably tell, it's a case that begins in a tenement building. This particular one was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. And these buildings were very crowded with families who had very little money. And the rooms were very poor. This is actually an abandoned room at the Tenement House Museum that is in Lower Manhattan today. These rooms often had no electricity, they had no hot water, and people who lived this way depended on gas to fuel everything from their stove to their electric lights. And this gas was called illuminating gas, and it was both a toxic and explosive mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. So you, the forensic scientist, are called to a crime scene in a tenement house. This is actually a police photo from the time in question, but the story that I'm going to tell you is a little more complicated than this. Nevertheless, you're going to go into this building, you're going to walk down this hall, you're going to go through the door, and you're going to find yourself in a very shabby apartment. The floors are splintered, the walls are peeling, there's only gas lighting, and in this case, you go into the back bedroom. There's clearly been a gas leak, there's a broken fitting on the wall. The police are opening the windows, and in the bed there's the body of young woman who's clearly been dead for some time because she's cold and she's stiff and she's pale. And you turn to the police and you say, "No, this is not an illuminating gas death because...." Because if you're killed by carbon monoxide, there is such a powerful chemical reaction in your blood as the oxygen is muscled out of the blood stream that the blood cells are turned a bright, cherry red. And this red is so strong that it flushes the skin of the corpse a cherry pink. In fact, people who see bodies after someone has died of a carbon monoxide death, they'll often talk about how healthy they look. So your poor, pale corpse could not have been killed by this gas. You take the body back to the morgue, you run more blood tests, and you find another gas at extremely high levels, carbon dioxide. And what does that tell you? If you think about the way we breath, we inhale oxygen, we exhale carbon dioxide, but what if you can't exhale? What if that gas can't get out? It backs up into your lungs, and the number one clue of a suffocation or a strangulation is elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. And in fact, what they found when they took a closer look at the body were the bruise marks left by her husband's fingers as he had held her down and suffocated her. And it turned out that he had taken out an insurance policy on her life, suffocated her, broken the gas fitting to try to stage an accident scene, and it turned out that it was chemistry that sent him to prison. There are so many good poison and murder stories from this time period that I would love to tell you. It's one of my favorite subjects obviously. But I want to leave you with this thought. Two things. One is that case that I just described to you is one of my favorites because it's the beginning of a series of investigations that persuade the New York police that they do need to work with scientists and it lays the foundation for, in fact, our CSI-era age, and, because it's such a good story of two very determined people, in this case two city scientists, who were able to change the world around them. Thank you.

There are so many good poison and murder stories from this time period that I would love to tell you. It's one of my favorite subjects obviously. But I want to leave you with this thought. Two things. One is that case that I just described to you is one of my favorites because it's the beginning of a series of investigations that persuade the New York police that they do need to work with scientists and it lays the foundation for, in fact, our CSI-era age, and, because it's such a good story of two very determined people, in this case two city scientists, who were able to change the world around them. Thank you.

**Question 5: What was a common use of arsenic trioxide in households in the early 20th century? Options: A. As a cleaning agent, B. As a food coloring, C. As a medicine, D. As a cosmetic**

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and options are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks why arsenic trioxide is the most famous homicidal poison in history, and the correct answer is that it was readily available, used to color foods, and used in cosmetics. Question 5 asks about a common use of arsenic trioxide in households, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's options.

However, I must note that there is no generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs seem to be more focused on specific details from the transcript, whereas the ground truth MCQ requires a more general understanding of the topic.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar, but I would also recommend creating a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So we live in what I think of as a CSI age where we take for granted that scientists are going to work together with the police, help them solve crimes, map fingerprints, analyze poisons, but in fact, this is really a very new idea. We only actually started training scientists and forensics in this country in the 1930s. So as a writer interested in chemistry, what I wondered was, "What was it like before scientists knew how to tease a poison out of a corpse, before you could actually catch a killer that way?" And it won't surprise you to learn that the answer is pretty dangerous. And in fact, in 1918, New York City issued a report admitting that smart poisoners could operate with impunity in the city. This is a 1918 crime scene photo from Brooklyn, and at this time, the coroner system was so corrupt that you could literally buy your cause of death. Often coroners didn't even show up at crime scenes. And if you go back and you look at the death certificates of the time, I found one that read, "Could be an auto accident or possibly diabetes." And another, which involved a man who shot himself in the head, said, "ruptured aneurysm". So you find, not surprisingly, the police saying, "We're going to look a lot smarter if we stay away from the science side of the story." But, in 1918 New York City appointed the first trained medical examiner it ever had. That's the gentleman sitting down there. And he hired the first forensic toxicologist ever attached to an American city. And together, these two men, Charles Norris, the medical examiner, and Alexander Gettler, the chemist sitting next to him, rewrote the rules of crime detection in this country. And that wasn't easy because poisons were everywhere. If we take this one, arsenic trioxide, arsenic trioxide's probably the most famous homicidal poison in history and it was in every home. Anyone could go to the grocery store or the pharmacy and buy it. It was in every kitchen because, believe it or not, it was used to color food. It was in medicines and it was in cosmetics in ways that prevented people from really understanding how dangerous these poisons were or how they worked. Now, scientists had in the 19th century begun developing tests to look for poisons in corpses. But as this cartoon shows you of the first test for arsenic, these were very primitive tests, so, that our heroes really have to figure this out as they go in the 1920s. Gettler, for instance, was the first person in the world to know how to tell if someone was drunk at time of death. He figured that out right about 1930 and he said later it took him 6,000 brains from the morgue to get to the point that he could get to that answer. And to give you a sense of what this is like, I'm going to ask you for a moment to become 1920s forensic detectives. This is a case based on one solved by Alexander Gettler in 1923, and as you can probably tell, it's a case that begins in a tenement building. This particular one was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. And these buildings were very crowded with families who had very little money. And the rooms were very poor. This is actually an abandoned room at the Tenement House Museum that is in Lower Manhattan today. These rooms often had no electricity, they had no hot water, and people who lived this way depended on gas to fuel everything from their stove to their electric lights. And this gas was called illuminating gas, and it was both a toxic and explosive mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. So you, the forensic scientist, are called to a crime scene in a tenement house. This is actually a police photo from the time in question, but the story that I'm going to tell you is a little more complicated than this. Nevertheless, you're going to go into this building, you're going to walk down this hall, you're going to go through the door, and you're going to find yourself in a very shabby apartment. The floors are splintered, the walls are peeling, there's only gas lighting, and in this case, you go into the back bedroom. There's clearly been a gas leak, there's a broken fitting on the wall. The police are opening the windows, and in the bed there's the body of young woman who's clearly been dead for some time because she's cold and she's stiff and she's pale. And you turn to the police and you say, "No, this is not an illuminating gas death because...." Because if you're killed by carbon monoxide, there is such a powerful chemical reaction in your blood as the oxygen is muscled out of the blood stream that the blood cells are turned a bright, cherry red. And this red is so strong that it flushes the skin of the corpse a cherry pink. In fact, people who see bodies after someone has died of a carbon monoxide death, they'll often talk about how healthy they look. So your poor, pale corpse could not have been killed by this gas. You take the body back to the morgue, you run more blood tests, and you find another gas at extremely high levels, carbon dioxide. And what does that tell you? If you think about the way we breath, we inhale oxygen, we exhale carbon dioxide, but what if you can't exhale? What if that gas can't get out? It backs up into your lungs, and the number one clue of a suffocation or a strangulation is elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. And in fact, what they found when they took a closer look at the body were the bruise marks left by her husband's fingers as he had held her down and suffocated her. And it turned out that he had taken out an insurance policy on her life, suffocated her, broken the gas fitting to try to stage an accident scene, and it turned out that it was chemistry that sent him to prison. There are so many good poison and murder stories from this time period that I would love to tell you. It's one of my favorite subjects obviously. But I want to leave you with this thought.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] i'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living and i'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free um but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children's hospital up at stanford in palo alto and it's from the experience of about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease now most of the time you think of pain is a symptom of a disease and that's true most of the time it's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation but about 10 of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for months and often times for years and when that happens it is its own disease and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients so imagine if you will then i'm stroking your arm with this feather as i'm stroking my arm right now now i want you to imagine that i'm stroking it with this please keep your seat a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain imagine if you will these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you were feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child's arm with this feather and their brain were telling them that they were feeling this hot torch that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph as you can see she's a beautiful young woman she was 16 years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that's the end of the story but in chandler's case that was the beginning of the story this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color it was categorically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hard wired like your house in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off the light goes off so people imagine the nervous system is just like that if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information up to the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simply where one nerve communicates with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your wall so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off that's crazy but that's in fact what happens with chronic pain and that's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler's we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with symptom modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life and we support all of that with a intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain it's successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doing a backflip and i had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at long beach here and she's doing absolutely fantastic but the future is actually even brighter the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain so that i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain thank you very much [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] i'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living and i'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free um but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children's hospital up at stanford in palo alto and it's from the experience of about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease now most of the time you think of pain is a symptom of a disease and that's true most of the time it's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation but about 10 of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for months and often times for years and when that happens it is its own disease and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients so imagine if you will then i'm stroking your arm with this feather as i'm stroking my arm right now now i want you to imagine that i'm stroking it with this please keep your seat a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain imagine if you will these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you were feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child's arm with this feather and their brain were telling them that they were feeling this hot torch that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph as you can see she's a beautiful young woman she was 16 years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that's the end of the story but in chandler's case that was the beginning of the story this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color it was categorically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hard wired like your house in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off the light goes off so people imagine the nervous system is just like that if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information up to the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simply where one nerve communicates with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your wall so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off that's crazy but that's in fact what happens with chronic pain and that's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler's we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with symptom modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life and we support all of that with a intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain it's successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doing a backflip and i had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at long beach here and she's doing absolutely fantastic but the future is actually even brighter the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain so that i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain thank you very much [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] i'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living and i'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free um but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children's hospital up at stanford in palo alto and it's from the experience of about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease now most of the time you think of pain is a symptom of a disease and that's true most of the time it's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation but about 10 of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for months and often times for years and when that happens it is its own disease and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients so imagine if you will then i'm stroking your arm with this feather as i'm stroking my arm right now now i want you to imagine that i'm stroking it with this please keep your seat a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain imagine if you will these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you were feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child's arm with this feather and their brain were telling them that they were feeling this hot torch that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph as you can see she's a beautiful young woman she was 16 years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that's the end of the story but in chandler's case that was the beginning of the story this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color it was categorically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hard wired like your house in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off the light goes off so people imagine the nervous system is just like that if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information up to the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simply where one nerve communicates with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your wall so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off that's crazy but that's in fact what happens with chronic pain and that's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler's we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with symptom modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life and we support all of that with a intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain it's successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doing a backflip and i had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at long beach here and she's doing absolutely fantastic but the future is actually even brighter the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain so that i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain thank you very much [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
hello my name is Thomas heatherwick um I'm uh I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings uh when I was growing up I was exposed to making and craft and materials and invention on a small scale and I was there looking at the largest scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in all the uh in the Publications that I was seeing was was felt soulless and cold and there on the smallest scale at the scale of an earring or a uh ceramic or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness and this uh influenced me the first building I built was 20 years ago and since in the last 20 years I've developed a studio in London and sorry this was my mother by the way in her shop bead shop in London I I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that I'm just going to show for people who don't know my Studio's work a few projects that we've worked on this is a hospital building thing this is a shop for a bag company this is uh Studios for artists this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball and this is a window display and this is a pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St Paul's Cathedral in London and this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk and this is a cafe by the sea in Britain and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the uh passenger their freedom again because uh the original rout Master bus that some of you made be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact I think all our root Masters are here in California now actually but they aren't in London um and so you're you're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to um uh stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop you're just a prisoner but the the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform uh so we've been working uh with Transport for London and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as as a client for a new bus for 50 years and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work the brief is that the bus should use 40% less energy so it's it's got hybrid drive and we've been working to try to improve working from everything from the fabric to the uh format and and uh structure and Aesthetics I was going to show four main projects and this is a a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open and opening seemed I mean everyone loves opening Bridges but it's quite a a kind of basic thing I mean I think we all stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed it I don't know if this is I'm slightly squeamish but the um you I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee and it had broken like this and um the and and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling but that there was a beautiful thing that had broken and so this is in Paddington in London and it's a very boring Bridge as you can see it's it's just steel and Timber and but instead of what it is our Focus was on the way the way it worked so we like the idea that the two furthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to half its speed cuz everyone was too scared when we first did it so that to speed it up a project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our future power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power um but recently any uh annual report of a power company has doesn't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that um and uh so we were when we were when the Consortium of Engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not going to just kind of decorate in a normal Power Station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on that just taking a field and bunging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just litter create one composition and what we found was I mean this this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain it was voted the worst place in Britain to live and there are 2,000 new homes being built bu next to this power station so it felt this has a a social Dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something that we are necessarily ashamed of so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to get my 250 foot high um and so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power Park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and a cost effective way of making a structure to do this so the the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a b Mitzvah at the top um and uh it's but it's it's a it's a power Park so people can come and really experience this and also look out uh all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in uh Shanghai we were invited to build uh the well we weren't invited what am I talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there um uh so to to so we won the competition to build the UK Pavilion and an expo is is a totally Bonkers thing uh there's 250 Pavilion um it the world's biggest ever Expo that had ever happened so there are up to a million people there every day and 250 countries all competing and the British government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became our uh the the the governmental goal is how do you stand out in this chaos of which is an expo um Vis of stimulus so we our sense was that we had to do one thing and and that only one thing instead of trying to have everything so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a Cheesy advert for Britain um but the the thing that was true the Expo is about the future of cities and uh particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into cities and the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain and the world's first major Botanical institution was is in London and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25% of all the world's plant species so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and I've never met anyone who says I don't like trees and the the same with flowers I've never met anyone who says I don't like flowers but that we realize that seeds there's this been this very serious project happening and but seeds these major botanical gardens there seeds aren't on show and you just have you have to go to garden center and they're in little paper packets but this this phenomenal Project's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds some kind of seed cedral but how could we show these teeny weeny things and the the film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts um so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we're trying to think how could we make a whole a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other Western Nations so that was also in the mix with a site the size of a football pitch and so there there was one particular toy that gave us a clue play top hair shop tops Play Tops the chair hair okay you get the idea so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious Optical hair and and grow that through through this box very simple box element uh and make a building that could move in the wind so the whole thing gently can move when the wind blows and inside the daylight it's each one is an optic and brings light into the center um and By Night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a big building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that so the the rest of the site was a public space and with that million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space the and we worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a a mini me version of the of the seed Cathedral so that even if you're partially cited that it was kind of crunchy Flo and soft that piece of landscape that you see there and then you know when you go uh when people when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur they in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we've shaved it and inside there's there's nothing there's no famous actor's voice there's no projections there's no televisions there's no color changing there's just silence and a cool temperature um and if you if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips that are letting the light through this is the only project that we've done where um the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact I mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possibly do at the Expo um and I just wanted to show you I mean the British government I mean any government is potentially the worst client in the world you ever possibly want to have and uh there was a lot of Terror and um but there was a kind of underlying support and that's uh and so there was a moment when suddenly and the actually the next thing this this is the head of UK trade and investment who was our clients um were with the Chinese children using the landscape go sorry I'm sorry about my stupid voice there um the uh so finally texture is something in the projects we've been working on uh the these kind of slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape but the materiality feels the same is something that we've been trying to um research really and explore Alternatives and the the project that we're building in uh Malaysia is uh apartment buildings for a property developer and it's in a piece of land that's this this site and the mayor of qual Lumpa said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in in this part of the world is that you you have your Tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked it's actually only the first couple of flaws that you really experience and the rest is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give a building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have 90% of the site as a rainforest instead of only 10% as scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings and so so we're we're building these these buildings they're they're actually identical so it's quite cost effective they're just chopped at different heights but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape rather than engulf it and that's my final slide thank you thank you so thank you thank you Thomas you're a delight since we have an extra minute here thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building um these are a few of the uh tests we did when we were building the structure so there were there were 66,000 of these this optic um was 22t long and so the daylight was just coming B was caught on the outside of the the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed and I mean waterproofing the building was a bit crazy CU normally it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it um it was quite a it was quite we had quite a time there was one person in the contractors who was the right size and it wasn't a child who could fit between them for for the final waterproofing of the building thank you Thomas

looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to get my 250 foot high um and so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power Park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and a cost effective way of making a structure to do this so the the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a b Mitzvah at the top um and uh it's but it's it's a it's a power Park so people can come and really experience this and also look out uh all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in uh Shanghai we were invited to build uh the well we weren't invited what am I talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there um uh so to to so we won the competition to build the UK Pavilion and an expo is is a totally Bonkers thing uh there's 250 Pavilion um it the world's biggest ever Expo that had ever happened so there are up to a million people there every day and 250 countries all competing and the British government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became our uh the the the governmental goal is how do you stand out in this chaos of which is an expo um Vis of stimulus so we our sense was that we had to do one thing and and that only one thing instead of trying to have everything so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a Cheesy advert for Britain um but the the thing that was true the Expo is about the future of cities and uh particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into cities and the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain and the world's first major Botanical institution was is in London and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25% of all the world's plant species so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and I've never met anyone who says I don't like trees and the the same with flowers I've never met anyone who says I don't like flowers but that we realize that seeds there's this been this very serious project happening and but seeds these major botanical gardens there seeds aren't on show and you just have you have to go to garden center and they're in little paper packets but this this phenomenal Project's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds some kind of seed cedral but how could we show these teeny weeny things and the the film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts um so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we're trying to think how could we make a whole a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other Western Nations so that was also in the mix with a site the size of a football pitch and so there there was one particular toy that gave us a clue play top hair shop tops Play Tops the chair hair okay you get the idea so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious Optical hair and and grow that through through this box very simple box element uh and make a building that could move in the wind so the whole thing gently can move when the wind blows and inside the daylight it's each one is an optic and brings light into the center um and By Night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a big building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that so the the rest of the site was a public space and with that million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space the and we worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a a mini me version of the of the seed Cathedral so that even if you're partially cited that it was kind of crunchy Flo and soft that piece of landscape that you see there and then you know when you go uh when people when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur they in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we've shaved it and inside there's there's nothing there's no famous actor's voice there's no projections there's no televisions there's no color changing there's just silence and a cool temperature um and if you if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips that are letting the light through this is the only project that we've done where um the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact I mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possibly do at the Expo um and I just wanted to show you I mean the British government I mean any government is potentially the worst client in the world you ever possibly want to have and uh there was a lot of Terror and um but there was a kind of underlying support and that's uh and so there was a moment when suddenly and the actually the next thing this this is the head of UK trade and investment who was our clients um were with the Chinese children using the landscape go sorry I'm sorry about my stupid voice there um the uh so finally texture is something in the projects we've been working on uh the these kind of slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape but the materiality feels the same is something that we've been trying to um research really and explore Alternatives and the the project that we're building in uh Malaysia is uh apartment buildings for a property developer and it's in a piece of land that's this this site and the mayor of qual Lumpa said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in in this part of the world is that you you have your Tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked it's actually only the first couple of flaws that you really experience and the rest is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give a building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have 90% of the site as a rainforest instead of only 10% as scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings and so so we're we're building these these buildings they're they're actually identical so it's quite cost effective they're just chopped at different heights but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape rather than engulf it and that's my final slide thank you thank you so thank you thank you Thomas you're a delight since we have an extra minute here thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building um these are a few of the uh tests we did when we were building the structure so there were there were 66,000 of these this optic um was 22t long and so the daylight was just coming B was caught on the outside of the the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed and I mean waterproofing the building was a bit crazy CU normally it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it um it was quite a it was quite we had quite a time there was one person in the contractors who was the right size and it wasn't a child who could fit between them for for the final waterproofing of the building thank you Thomas

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 7: What was the inspiration behind the design of the Seed Cathedral? Options: A. A desire to showcase British culture, B. A want to create a unique shape, C. A need to display 66,000 seeds, D. A film about dinosaurs**

However, the correct option in Question 7 is not explicitly stated as "A film about dinosaurs" but rather as "D. A film about dinosaurs", and it does not specify the name of the film. 

A more accurate match would be:

**Question 8: How did Thomas Heatherwick's studio address the challenge of displaying 66,000 seeds? Options: A. By creating a large, elaborate structure, B. By using a unique optical hair to trap each seed, C. By building a separate building for the seeds, D. By using a combination of light and sound**

is not the best match.

But in the transcript it is mentioned that "The film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts"

Hence the best match is

**Transcript**:
hello my name is Thomas heatherwick um I'm uh I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings uh when I was growing up I was exposed to making and craft and materials and invention on a small scale and I was there looking at the largest scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in all the uh in the Publications that I was seeing was was felt soulless and cold and there on the smallest scale at the scale of an earring or a uh ceramic or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness and this uh influenced me the first building I built was 20 years ago and since in the last 20 years I've developed a studio in London and sorry this was my mother by the way in her shop bead shop in London I I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that I'm just going to show for people who don't know my Studio's work a few projects that we've worked on this is a hospital building thing this is a shop for a bag company this is uh Studios for artists this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball and this is a window display and this is a pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St Paul's Cathedral in London and this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk and this is a cafe by the sea in Britain and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the uh passenger their freedom again because uh the original rout Master bus that some of you made be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact I think all our root Masters are here in California now actually but they aren't in London um and so you're you're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to um uh stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop you're just a prisoner but the the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform uh so we've been working uh with Transport for London and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as as a client for a new bus for 50 years and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work the brief is that the bus should use 40% less energy so it's it's got hybrid drive and we've been working to try to improve working from everything from the fabric to the uh format and and uh structure and Aesthetics I was going to show four main projects and this is a a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open and opening seemed I mean everyone loves opening Bridges but it's quite a a kind of basic thing I mean I think we all stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed it I don't know if this is I'm slightly squeamish but the um you I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee and it had broken like this and um the and and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling but that there was a beautiful thing that had broken and so this is in Paddington in London and it's a very boring Bridge as you can see it's it's just steel and Timber and but instead of what it is our Focus was on the way the way it worked so we like the idea that the two furthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to half its speed cuz everyone was too scared when we first did it so that to speed it up a project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our future power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power um but recently any uh annual report of a power company has doesn't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that um and uh so we were when we were when the Consortium of Engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not going to just kind of decorate in a normal Power Station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on that just taking a field and bunging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just litter create one composition and what we found was I mean this this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain it was voted the worst place in Britain to live and there are 2,000 new homes being built bu next to this power station so it felt this has a a social Dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something that we are necessarily ashamed of so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses on the solution to the challenge rather than the challenge itself.

A more similar question would be one that focuses on the challenge of building the Seed Cathedral. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, although it is still not a perfect match.

**Question 6: What was the challenge in designing the UK Pavilion for the Expo in Shanghai? Options: A. To create a unique shape, B. To stand out in a crowded Expo, C. To showcase British culture, D. To build a large structure**

This question is not a perfect match because it does not specifically mention the Seed Cathedral, and the options do not include the correct answer (B. How to bring light inside and make the cathedral emanate).

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, although it is not a perfect match.

it's a very boring Bridge as you can see it's it's just steel and Timber and but instead of what it is our Focus was on the way the way it worked so we like the idea that the two furthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to half its speed cuz everyone was too scared when we first did it so that to speed it up a project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our future power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power um but recently any uh annual report of a power company has doesn't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that um and uh so we were when we were when the Consortium of Engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not going to just kind of decorate in a normal Power Station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on that just taking a field and bunging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just litter create one composition and what we found was I mean this this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain it was voted the worst place in Britain to live and there are 2,000 new homes being built bu next to this power station so it felt this has a a social Dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something that we are necessarily ashamed of so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to get my 250 foot high um and so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power Park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and a cost effective way of making a structure to do this so the the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a b Mitzvah at the top um and uh it's but it's it's a it's a power Park so people can come and really experience this and also look out uh all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in uh Shanghai we were invited to build uh the well we weren't invited what am I talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there um uh so to to so we won the competition to build the UK Pavilion and an expo is is a totally Bonkers thing uh there's 250 Pavilion um it the world's biggest ever Expo that had ever happened so there are up to a million people there every day and 250 countries all competing and the British government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became our uh the the the governmental goal is how do you stand out in this chaos of which is an expo um Vis of stimulus so we our sense was that we had to do one thing and and that only one thing instead of trying to have everything so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a Cheesy advert for Britain um but the the thing that was true the Expo is about the future of cities and uh particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into cities and the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain and the world's first major Botanical institution was is in London and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25% of all the world's plant species so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and I've never met anyone who says I don't like trees and the the same with flowers I've never met anyone who says I don't like flowers but that we realize that seeds there's this been this very serious project happening and but seeds these major botanical gardens there seeds aren't on show and you just have you have to go to garden center and they're in little paper packets but this this phenomenal Project's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds some kind of seed cedral but how could we show these teeny weeny things and the the film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts um so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we're trying to think how could we make a whole a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other Western Nations so that was also in the mix with a site the size of a football pitch and so there there was one particular toy that gave us a clue play top hair shop tops Play Tops the chair hair okay you get the idea so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious Optical hair and and grow that through through this box very simple box element uh and make a building that could move in the wind so the whole thing gently can move when the wind blows and inside the daylight it's each one is an optic and brings light into the center um and By Night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a big building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that so the the rest of the site was a public space and with that million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space the and we worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a a mini me version of the of the seed Cathedral so that even if you're partially cited that it was kind of crunchy Flo and soft that piece of landscape that you see there and then you know when you go uh when people when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur they in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we've shaved it and inside there's there's nothing there's no famous actor's voice there's no projections there's no televisions there's no color changing there's just silence and a cool temperature um and if you if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips that are letting the light through this is the only project that we've done where um the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact I mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possibly do at the Expo um and I just wanted to show you I mean the British government I mean any government is potentially the worst client in the world you ever possibly want to have and uh there was a lot of Terror and um but there was a kind of underlying support and that's uh and so there was a moment when suddenly and the actually the next thing this this is the head of UK trade and investment who was our clients um were with the Chinese children using the landscape go sorry I'm sorry about my stupid voice there um the uh so finally texture is something in the projects we've been working on uh the these kind of slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape but the materiality feels the same is something that we've been trying to um research really and explore Alternatives and the the project that we're building in uh Malaysia is uh apartment buildings for a property developer and it's in a piece of land that's this this site and the mayor of qual Lumpa said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in in this part of the world is that you you have your Tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked it's actually only the first couple of flaws that you really experience and the rest is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give a building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have 90% of the site as a rainforest instead of only 10% as scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings and so so we're we're building these these buildings they're they're actually identical so it's quite cost effective they're just chopped at different heights but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape rather than engulf it and that's my final slide thank you thank you so thank you thank you Thomas you're a delight since we have an extra minute here thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building um these are a few of the uh tests we did when we were building the structure so there were there were 66,000 of these this optic um was 22t long and so the daylight was just coming B was caught on the outside of the the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed and I mean waterproofing the building was a bit crazy CU normally it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it um it was quite a it was quite we had quite a time there was one person in the contractors who was the right size and it wasn't a child who could fit between them for for the final waterproofing of the building thank you Thomas

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry, a lesson of transformation. Step 1: Write it all down. "Take one memory, explore it like a new land," the visiting poet tells the class. "Don't leave anything out." Tyler sits in this high school workshop, dizzy with where to start. Memories wander in and out of his heart like vagrants searching for home. He bends to his desk, he writes, "The snow goes black when the moon turns its eyes away, all paper is yellow, all letters spell eviction note, Mama's lies are footsteps too many to count. Making excuses on black snow. 'I paid the rent, this is your room forever, baby. I love you.' But, she wouldn't even look at me." Step 2: Read out loud. As he writes, his lips try on words then toss them out like bad tenants. He pushes his desk back, stands. "Aunt Jocelyn's rice pudding was sweet, but that's not what I want to write. Have you ever been so cold your hair becomes an icicle? Your little sister's fear of the dark freezes on her lips like she's kissed the ice tray? How hungry have you been?" Step 3: Cut the fat. Abandon extra words. His pen becomes a machete, slashing ands, thens, becauses. Step 4: Read out loud, again. The 11th grade boy makes sure Step 3's cuts weren't too deep. Step 5: Add flava. Juice, power, movement, emotion. "Vanilla flavoring is the secret to my aunt's pudding. I kick out a few raisins but leave one or two. Life needs some bitter to man up the sweet." His hands reach out like shells to hold our disbelief. Is this Tyler speaking? The one who keeps his eyes on the floor like they're carrying something heavy? Voice rattles windows. "I am free now." Body quivers with the pulse of each word. "The sun's joy melts snow." Fingers trace the curve of his jaw. "My aunt's face was warm as a water heater when she let us in that night." Our boy is done, his transformation complete. Step 1: Write it all down. Step 2: Read out loud. Step 3: Cut the fat. Step 4: Read out loud. Step 5: Add flava. Tyler's first poem takes residence in his heart. He flings his arms wide like an open door. Welcome home!

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What is the first step in Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry? Options: A. Read out loud, B. Cut the fat, C. Write it all down, D. Add flava.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about Step 2. A more suitable match would be a question that asks about Step 2 directly.

Upon closer inspection, we can see that Question 5 asks about Step 3, and Question 9 asks about Step 5. There isn't a direct match for Step 2. However, if we consider the options provided in the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 2 has an option "A. Read out loud", which is the correct answer for Step 2.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that has the same question intent as the ground truth MCQ. In this case, we can consider Question 5, which asks about the purpose of a specific step. If we had a generated MCQ that asks about the purpose or action of Step 2, it would be a more suitable match.

Since we don't have a direct match, the closest match would be a question that has a similar intent. In this case, the closest match is Question 5. However, this is not an exact match.

If we were to rewrite the generated MCQs to match the ground truth MCQs, a more suitable match would be:

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry, a lesson of transformation. Step 1: Write it all down. "Take one memory, explore it like a new land," the visiting poet tells the class. "Don't leave anything out." Tyler sits in this high school workshop, dizzy with where to start. Memories wander in and out of his heart like vagrants searching for home. He bends to his desk, he writes, "The snow goes black when the moon turns its eyes away, all paper is yellow, all letters spell eviction note, Mama's lies are footsteps too many to count. Making excuses on black snow. 'I paid the rent, this is your room forever, baby. I love you.' But, she wouldn't even look at me." Step 2: Read out loud. As he writes, his lips try on words then toss them out like bad tenants. He pushes his desk back, stands. "Aunt Jocelyn's rice pudding was sweet, but that's not what I want to write. Have you ever been so cold your hair becomes an icicle? Your little sister's fear of the dark freezes on her lips like she's kissed the ice tray? How hungry have you been?" Step 3: Cut the fat. Abandon extra words. His pen becomes a machete, slashing ands, thens, becauses. Step 4: Read out loud, again. The 11th grade boy makes sure Step 3's cuts weren't too deep. Step 5: Add flava. Juice, power, movement, emotion. "Vanilla flavoring is the secret to my aunt's pudding. I kick out a few raisins but leave one or two. Life needs some bitter to man up the sweet." His hands reach out like shells to hold our disbelief. Is this Tyler speaking? The one who keeps his eyes on the floor like they're carrying something heavy? Voice rattles windows. "I am free now." Body quivers with the pulse of each word. "The sun's joy melts snow." Fingers trace the curve of his jaw. "My aunt's face was warm as a water heater when she let us in that night." Our boy is done, his transformation complete. Step 1: Write it all down. Step 2: Read out loud. Step 3: Cut the fat. Step 4: Read out loud. Step 5: Add flava. Tyler's first poem takes residence in his heart. He flings his arms wide like an open door. Welcome home!

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As any current or past
geometry student knows, the father of geometry was Euclid, a Greek mathematician who lived
in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 B.C.E. Euclid is known as the author
of a singularly influential work known as "Elements." You think your math book is long? Euclid's "Elements" is 13 volumes
full of just geometry. In "Elements," Euclid structured
and supplemented the work of many mathematicians
that came before him, such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus,
Hippocrates and others. Euclid laid it all out
as a logical system of proof built up from a set of definitions, common notions,
and his five famous postulates. Four of these postulates
are very simple and straightforward, two points determine a line, for example. The fifth one, however,
is the seed that grows our story. This fifth mysterious postulate
is known simply as the parallel postulate. You see, unlike the first four, the fifth postulate is worded
in a very convoluted way. Euclid's version states that, "If a line falls on two other lines so that the measure of the two interior
angles on the same side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then the lines eventually
intersect on that side, and therefore are not parallel." Wow, that is a mouthful! Here's the simpler, more familiar version: "In a plane, through any point
not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn
that's parallel to the original one." Many mathematicians over the centuries
tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four,
but weren't able to do so. In the process, they began looking at
what would happen logically if the fifth postulate
were actually not true. Some of the greatest minds in the history
of mathematics ask this question, people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri, János Bolyai, Carl Gauss,
and Nikolai Lobachevsky. They all experimented
with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise
to entire alternative geometries. These geometries became collectively known
as non-Euclidean geometries. We'll leave the details of these
different geometries for another lesson. The main difference depends
on the curvature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed. Turns out Euclid did not tell us
the entire story in "Elements," and merely described one possible way
to look at the universe. It all depends on the context
of what you're looking at. Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively
curved surfaces display very different characteristics. At first these alternative
geometries seemed strange, but were soon found to be equally adept
at describing the world around us. Navigating our planet
requires elliptical geometry while the much of the art of M.C. Escher
displays hyperbolic geometry. Albert Einstein used
non-Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space-time
becomes warped in the presence of matter, as part of his general
theory of relativity. The big mystery is whether
Euclid had any inkling of the existence
of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate. We may never know, but it's hard to believe he had
no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field
as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote
the postulate in such a way as to leave curious minds after him
to flush out the details. If so, he's probably pleased. These discoveries
could never have been made without gifted, progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside
of what they've been taught. We, too, must be willing at times
to put aside our preconceived notions and physical experiences and look at the larger picture, or we risk not seeing
the rest of the story.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs are related to the transcript provided, but they do not specifically address the question of when Euclid lived.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the transcript content, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it still does not match the ground truth MCQ. Question 3 asks about the number of volumes in Euclid's "Elements", which is mentioned in the same paragraph as the information about when Euclid lived.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 6 does not have options that match the ground truth MCQ, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs.

A closer analysis reveals that Question 8 is related to the concept of non-Euclidean geometry, and although it does not directly ask about the categories of non-Euclidean geometry, one of its options (C) mentions "The curvature of the surface", which is related to the concept of elliptical and hyperbolic geometries.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 8, as it is the closest in terms of content and intent.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Question 7 asks about the mathematicians who experimented with negating the parallel postulate, which is related to the ground truth MCQ that asks about a mathematician who is not known for having worked on negating the Parallel Postulate. 

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about a mathematician who is not known for having worked on negating the Parallel Postulate.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As any current or past
geometry student knows, the father of geometry was Euclid, a Greek mathematician who lived
in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 B.C.E. Euclid is known as the author
of a singularly influential work known as "Elements." You think your math book is long? Euclid's "Elements" is 13 volumes
full of just geometry. In "Elements," Euclid structured
and supplemented the work of many mathematicians
that came before him, such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus,
Hippocrates and others. Euclid laid it all out
as a logical system of proof built up from a set of definitions, common notions,
and his five famous postulates. Four of these postulates
are very simple and straightforward, two points determine a line, for example. The fifth one, however,
is the seed that grows our story. This fifth mysterious postulate
is known simply as the parallel postulate. You see, unlike the first four, the fifth postulate is worded
in a very convoluted way. Euclid's version states that, "If a line falls on two other lines so that the measure of the two interior
angles on the same side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then the lines eventually
intersect on that side, and therefore are not parallel." Wow, that is a mouthful! Here's the simpler, more familiar version: "In a plane, through any point
not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn
that's parallel to the original one." Many mathematicians over the centuries
tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four,
but weren't able to do so. In the process, they began looking at
what would happen logically if the fifth postulate
were actually not true. Some of the greatest minds in the history
of mathematics ask this question, people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri, János Bolyai, Carl Gauss,
and Nikolai Lobachevsky. They all experimented
with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise
to entire alternative geometries. These geometries became collectively known
as non-Euclidean geometries. We'll leave the details of these
different geometries for another lesson. The main difference depends
on the curvature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed. Turns out Euclid did not tell us
the entire story in "Elements," and merely described one possible way
to look at the universe. It all depends on the context
of what you're looking at. Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively
curved surfaces display very different characteristics. At first these alternative
geometries seemed strange, but were soon found to be equally adept
at describing the world around us. Navigating our planet
requires elliptical geometry while the much of the art of M.C. Escher
displays hyperbolic geometry. Albert Einstein used
non-Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space-time
becomes warped in the presence of matter, as part of his general
theory of relativity. The big mystery is whether
Euclid had any inkling of the existence
of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate. We may never know, but it's hard to believe he had
no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field
as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote
the postulate in such a way as to leave curious minds after him
to flush out the details. If so, he's probably pleased. These discoveries
could never have been made without gifted, progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside

Reviewer: Morton Bast I'm a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and my favorite hobby is photography. And as I travel around the world, I love taking photographs like these, so I can remember all
the beautiful and interesting things that I've seen. But what I can't do is record and share how these objects feel to touch. And that's kind of surprising, because your sense of touch
is really important. It's involved in every physical
interaction you do every day, every manipulation task,
anything you do in the world. So the sense of touch
is actually pretty interesting. It has two main components. The first is tactile sensations, things you feel in your skin. And the second is kinesthetic sensations. This has to do with the position
of your body and how it's moving, and the forces you encounter. And you're really good at incorporating both of these types of sensations together to understand the physical interactions
you have with the world and understand as you touch a surface: is it a rock, is it a cat,
is it a bunny, what is it? And so, as an engineer, I'm really fascinated and I have a lot of respect
for how good people are with their hands. And I'm intrigued and curious about whether we could
make technology better by doing a better job at leveraging the human capability
with the sense of touch. Could I improve the interfaces
to computers and machines by letting you take
advantage of your hands? And indeed, I think we can, and that's at the core
of a field called haptics, and this is the area that I work in. It's all about interactive
touch technology. And the way it works is, as you move your body through the world, if, as an engineer, I can make a system
that can measure that motion, and then present to you
sensations over time that kind of make sense, that match up with what you might feel
in the real world, I can fool you into thinking
you're touching something even though there's nothing there. So here are three examples and these are all done
from research in my lab at Penn. The first one is all about that same
problem that I was showing you: how can we capture how objects feel and recreate those experiences? So the way we solve this problem is by creating a hand-held tool that has many different sensors inside. It has a force sensor, so we can tell
how hard you're pushing; it has motion tracking, so we can tell
exactly where you've moved it; and it has a vibration sensor,
an accelerometer, inside, that detects the shaking
back and forth of the tool that lets you know
that's a piece of canvas and not a piece of silk or something else. Then we take the data we record
from these interactions. Here's ten seconds of data. You can see how the vibrations
get larger and smaller, depending on how you move. And we make a mathematical
model of those relationships and program them into a tablet computer so that when you take the stylus and go and touch the screen, that voice-coil actuator
in the white bracket plays vibrations to give you the illusion that you're touching the real surface, just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas. We can create very compelling illusions. We can do this for all kinds of surfaces
and it's really a lot of fun. We call it haptography --
haptic photography. And I think it has potential
benefits in all sorts of areas like online shopping,
maybe interactive museum exhibits, where you're not supposed
to touch the precious artifacts, but you always want to. The second example I want to tell you
about comes from a collaboration I have with Dr. Margrit Maggio
at the Penn Dental School. Part of her job is to teach
dental students how to tell where in a patient's mouth
there are cavities. Of course they look at X-rays, but a large part of this clinical judgment
comes from what they feel when they touch your teeth
with a dental explorer. You've all had this happen,
they go across. What they're feeling for is if the tooth
is really hard, then it's healthy, but if it's kind of soft and sticky, that's a signal that the enamel
is starting to decay. These types of judgments are hard
for a new dental student to make, because they haven't touched
a lot of teeth yet. And you want them to learn this
before they start practicing on real human patients. So what we do is add an accelerometer
on to the dental explorer, and then we record what Dr. Maggio feels as she touches different extracted teeth. And we can play it back for you as a video with a touch track -- not just a sound track,
but also a touch track, that you can feel by holding
that repeating tool. You feel the same things the dentist
felt when they did the recording, and practice making judgments. So here's a sample one. Here's a tooth that looks
kind of suspicious, right? It has all those brown stains. You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth." But if you pay attention to how it feels, all the surfaces of this tooth
are hard and healthy, so this patient does not need a filling. And these are exactly the kind
of judgments doctors make every day and I think this technology
we've invented has a lot of potential for many different things in medical
training, because it's really simple and it does a great job at recreating
what people feel through tools. I think it could also help make games
more interactive and fun and more realistic
in the sensations that you feel. The last example I want to tell you about
is again about human movement. So if any of you have ever learned sports, how do you get good
at something like surfing? You practice. You practice some more and more, right? Making small corrections,
maybe getting some input from a coach, learning how to improve your motions. I think we could use computers to help make that process
more efficient and more fun. And so here, for example,
if I have six different arm movements that I want you to learn, you come into my lab at Penn
and try out our system. We use a Kinect to measure your motions,
we show graphics on the screen, and then we also give you touch cues, haptic feedback on your arm, delivered by these haptic arm bands
which have motors inside, and guide you as you move. So, if we put it together, as you're trying to track this motion, if you deviate -- say, maybe,
your arm is a little too high -- we turn on the motors
right there on the skin to let you know you should move down, almost like a coach gently guiding you and helping you master
these movements more quickly and make more precise corrections. We developed this system
for use in stroke rehabilitation, but I think there are a lot
of applications, like maybe dance training
or all sorts of sports training as well. So now you know a little bit
about the field of haptics, which I think you'll hear more
about in the coming years. I've shown you three examples. I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the great students
who work with me in my lab at Penn and my collaborators. They're a great group. I also want to thank you
for your kind attention. (Applause)

back and forth of the tool that lets you know
that's a piece of canvas and not a piece of silk or something else. Then we take the data we record
from these interactions. Here's ten seconds of data. You can see how the vibrations
get larger and smaller, depending on how you move. And we make a mathematical
model of those relationships and program them into a tablet computer so that when you take the stylus and go and touch the screen, that voice-coil actuator
in the white bracket plays vibrations to give you the illusion that you're touching the real surface, just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas. We can create very compelling illusions. We can do this for all kinds of surfaces
and it's really a lot of fun. We call it haptography --
haptic photography. And I think it has potential
benefits in all sorts of areas like online shopping,
maybe interactive museum exhibits, where you're not supposed
to touch the precious artifacts, but you always want to. The second example I want to tell you
about comes from a collaboration I have with Dr. Margrit Maggio
at the Penn Dental School. Part of her job is to teach
dental students how to tell where in a patient's mouth
there are cavities. Of course they look at X-rays, but a large part of this clinical judgment
comes from what they feel when they touch your teeth
with a dental explorer. You've all had this happen,
they go across. What they're feeling for is if the tooth
is really hard, then it's healthy, but if it's kind of soft and sticky, that's a signal that the enamel
is starting to decay. These types of judgments are hard
for a new dental student to make, because they haven't touched
a lot of teeth yet. And you want them to learn this
before they start practicing on real human patients. So what we do is add an accelerometer
on to the dental explorer, and then we record what Dr. Maggio feels as she touches different extracted teeth. And we can play it back for you as a video with a touch track -- not just a sound track,
but also a touch track, that you can feel by holding
that repeating tool. You feel the same things the dentist
felt when they did the recording, and practice making judgments. So here's a sample one. Here's a tooth that looks
kind of suspicious, right? It has all those brown stains. You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth." But if you pay attention to how it feels, all the surfaces of this tooth
are hard and healthy, so this patient does not need a filling. And these are exactly the kind
of judgments doctors make every day and I think this technology
we've invented has a lot of potential for many different things in medical
training, because it's really simple and it does a great job at recreating
what people feel through tools. I think it could also help make games
more interactive and fun and more realistic
in the sensations that you feel. The last example I want to tell you about
is again about human movement. So if any of you have ever learned sports, how do you get good
at something like surfing? You practice. You practice some more and more, right? Making small corrections,
maybe getting some input from a coach, learning how to improve your motions. I think we could use computers to help make that process
more efficient and more fun. And so here, for example,
if I have six different arm movements that I want you to learn, you come into my lab at Penn
and try out our system. We use a Kinect to measure your motions,
we show graphics on the screen, and then we also give you touch cues, haptic feedback on your arm, delivered by these haptic arm bands
which have motors inside, and guide you as you move. So, if we put it together, as you're trying to track this motion, if you deviate -- say, maybe,
your arm is a little too high -- we turn on the motors
right there on the skin to let you know you should move down, almost like a coach gently guiding you and helping you master
these movements more quickly and make more precise corrections. We developed this system
for use in stroke rehabilitation, but I think there are a lot
of applications, like maybe dance training
or all sorts of sports training as well. So now you know a little bit
about the field of haptics, which I think you'll hear more
about in the coming years. I've shown you three examples. I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the great students
who work with me in my lab at Penn and my collaborators. They're a great group. I also want to thank you
for your kind attention. (Applause)

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Morton Bast I'm a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and my favorite hobby is photography. And as I travel around the world, I love taking photographs like these, so I can remember all
the beautiful and interesting things that I've seen. But what I can't do is record and share how these objects feel to touch. And that's kind of surprising, because your sense of touch
is really important. It's involved in every physical
interaction you do every day, every manipulation task,
anything you do in the world. So the sense of touch
is actually pretty interesting. It has two main components. The first is tactile sensations, things you feel in your skin. And the second is kinesthetic sensations. This has to do with the position
of your body and how it's moving, and the forces you encounter. And you're really good at incorporating both of these types of sensations together to understand the physical interactions
you have with the world and understand as you touch a surface: is it a rock, is it a cat,
is it a bunny, what is it? And so, as an engineer, I'm really fascinated and I have a lot of respect
for how good people are with their hands. And I'm intrigued and curious about whether we could
make technology better by doing a better job at leveraging the human capability
with the sense of touch. Could I improve the interfaces
to computers and machines by letting you take
advantage of your hands? And indeed, I think we can, and that's at the core
of a field called haptics, and this is the area that I work in. It's all about interactive
touch technology. And the way it works is, as you move your body through the world, if, as an engineer, I can make a system
that can measure that motion, and then present to you
sensations over time that kind of make sense, that match up with what you might feel
in the real world, I can fool you into thinking
you're touching something even though there's nothing there. So here are three examples and these are all done
from research in my lab at Penn. The first one is all about that same
problem that I was showing you: how can we capture how objects feel and recreate those experiences? So the way we solve this problem is by creating a hand-held tool that has many different sensors inside. It has a force sensor, so we can tell
how hard you're pushing; it has motion tracking, so we can tell
exactly where you've moved it; and it has a vibration sensor,
an accelerometer, inside, that detects the shaking
back and forth of the tool that lets you know
that's a piece of canvas and not a piece of silk or something else. Then we take the data we record
from these interactions. Here's ten seconds of data. You can see how the vibrations
get larger and smaller, depending on how you move. And we make a mathematical
model of those relationships and program them into a tablet computer so that when you take the stylus and go and touch the screen, that voice-coil actuator
in the white bracket plays vibrations to give you the illusion that you're touching the real surface, just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas. We can create very compelling illusions. We can do this for all kinds of surfaces
and it's really a lot of fun. We call it haptography --

[Music] how would you like to be better than you are suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self-confident how about living longer with good health or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one creativity how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good how many would opt for memory quite a few more how about Fitness few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject the great 20th century geneticist TG dodging ski who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life in this picture I've put a bush with a centre branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the Tree of Life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in we branched off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about 6 or 8 million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids some have come and gone we have been here for about a hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe 10 times more I mean think of it when Anthony Damacio asks about your self-image do you think about the bacteria our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it's war it's dark its moist it's very cozy and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it's really like an easy Street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended force rush to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four-and-a-half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so I hope you enjoyed it now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi-celled organisms come online things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction now I have to confess when I was a college undergraduate I thought okay sex death sex death death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing years I've come to have increasing doubts I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s and one night there's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl she looks at him and says I'm here for super sex that's fine says George I'll take the soup I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different I was trying to preserve the body I wanted to keep us healthy I wanted to restore health from disease I wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous-vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility I call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring there in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it's not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years it costs 2.7 billion dollars the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in 3 to 4 months today you can have a complete sequence of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week it won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the Lasker prize was awarded to the scientists Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a flurry potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible imagine then just two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm in the OVA or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old-style evolution into neo evolution will take a process that normally might require a hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us thank you [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] how would you like to be better than you are suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self-confident how about living longer with good health or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one creativity how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good how many would opt for memory quite a few more how about Fitness few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject the great 20th century geneticist TG dodging ski who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life in this picture I've put a bush with a centre branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the Tree of Life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in we branched off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about 6 or 8 million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids some have come and gone we have been here for about a hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe 10 times more I mean think of it when Anthony Damacio asks about your self-image do you think about the bacteria our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it's war it's dark its moist it's very cozy and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it's really like an easy Street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended force rush to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four-and-a-half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so I hope you enjoyed it now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi-celled organisms come online things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction now I have to confess when I was a college undergraduate I thought okay sex death sex death death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing years I've come to have increasing doubts I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s and one night there's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl she looks at him and says I'm here for super sex that's fine says George I'll take the soup I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different I was trying to preserve the body I wanted to keep us healthy I wanted to restore health from disease I wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous-vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility I call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring there in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it's not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years it costs 2.7 billion dollars the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in 3 to 4 months today you can have a complete sequence of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week it won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the Lasker prize was awarded to the scientists Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a flurry potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible imagine then just two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm in the OVA or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old-style evolution into neo evolution will take a process that normally might require a hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us thank you [Applause]

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly. A more suitable match is not present among the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest in terms of the evolutionary concept discussed.

That being said, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about what evolution favors according to Fineberg. If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a perfect match, but if I had to select one, I would choose **Question 5** as the closest match, with the understanding that it's not an exact match.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that it's not an exact match)

[Music] how would you like to be better than you are suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self-confident how about living longer with good health or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one creativity how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good how many would opt for memory quite a few more how about Fitness few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject the great 20th century geneticist TG dodging ski who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life in this picture I've put a bush with a centre branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the Tree of Life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in we branched off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about 6 or 8 million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids some have come and gone we have been here for about a hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe 10 times more I mean think of it when Anthony Damacio asks about your self-image do you think about the bacteria our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it's war it's dark its moist it's very cozy and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it's really like an easy Street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended force rush to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four-and-a-half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so I hope you enjoyed it now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi-celled organisms come online things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction now I have to confess when I was a college undergraduate I thought okay sex death sex death death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing years I've come to have increasing doubts I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s and one night there's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl she looks at him and says I'm here for super sex that's fine says George I'll take the soup I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different I was trying to preserve the body I wanted to keep us healthy I wanted to restore health from disease I wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous-vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility I call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring there in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it's not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years it costs 2.7 billion dollars the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in 3 to 4 months today you can have a complete sequence of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week it won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the Lasker prize was awarded to the scientists Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a flurry potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible imagine then just two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm in the OVA or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old-style evolution into neo evolution will take a process that normally might require a hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us thank you [Applause]

**Transcript**:
one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument which would think if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of Congress I have a suggestion look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same-sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens Aristotle's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so you ready for the lecture according to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that's that's it that's the lecture now you may say well that's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones let's see what people what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out at random you would do it by lottery or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them well the best flute players the worst flute players how many say the best flute players why why should the best flute actually that was Aristotle's answer to but here's a harder question why do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players who's the greatest benefit to all will hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players that's Peter alright well it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music has played rather than terrible music but Peter Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said that's what flutes are for to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or of the social activity in this case musical performance and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it will be a happy by-product that we'll all benefit but when we think about justice Aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case let's take a contemporary example of a dispute about justice had to do with golf Casey Martin a few years ago Casey Martin did any of you hear about him he is a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury he asked the PGA the Professional Golfers Association for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments they said no no that would give you an unfair advantage he sued and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court believe it or not the case over the golf cart because the law says the distance that the disabled must be accommodated provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity he says I'm a great golfer I want to compete but I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose you were on the Supreme Court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case how many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn't let's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of Casey Martin and how many would not how many would say he doesn't have all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart what would be your reason raise your hand and we'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart all right those of you I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worried about an unfair advantage what about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes all right what's your name Charley says well get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us Charley why why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart but what about walking from hole to hole it doesn't matter it's not part of the game walking the course is not part of the game of golf not in my opinion all right stay there Charley who has an answer who has an answer for chart by the way all right who has an answer for Charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game walking all those holes walking all those holes that's part of part of the game of golf absolutely what's your name Warren Warren Charlie what do you say to war I'll stick to my original thesis well we're on our you golf er I'm not a golfer and I am okay you know it's interesting in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with Warren they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting well by I should tell you how the Supreme Court refers the Supreme Court decided what are you suppose they said they said yes that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf and the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question and justice Stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf and the essential point of the game is to get a very small ball from one place into a hole and as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was Justice Scalia he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion he said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf here's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of the games arbitrary rules is essential so there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way if we thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game it's also objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness on what's an unfair advantage but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be let everyone write in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been I suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA even than making an exception for Casey Martin why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point that's delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in the golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that with golf as with flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what quality is what excellence is connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same-sex marriage there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only and how many favor the second same-sex marriage now put it this way what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about so with flutes with golf carts and even with a few sleek intested question like same-sex marriage aristotle has a point very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve elevate the terms of political discourse in the United States and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring the civic life it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much okay okay okay so from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage that was genius Lee now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series is one of the first to do a big what's your vision for the next phase of this well I think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments and some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and I think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in China in India in Africa around the world to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate so you picture at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from China and India joining in right we did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach and we do it in the classroom at Harvard with about a thousand students wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in Beijing and in Mumbai and in Cambridge Massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what I would love to do so I would imagine I would imagine that there are a lot of people would love to join you on that endeavor Michael Sandel thank you so much

one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument which would think if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of Congress I have a suggestion look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same-sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens Aristotle's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so you ready for the lecture according to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that's that's it that's the lecture now you may say well that's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones let's see what people what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out at random you would do it by lottery or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them well the best flute players the worst flute players how many say

**Question 4: Why does Aristotle think the best flute players should get the best flutes?**

Options: A. Because it will make everyone happy, B. Because it will produce excellent music, C. Because it is fair, D. Because it is what the majority wants

Although the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. The correct answer, according to the transcript, is that Aristotle thinks the best flute players should get the best flutes because it is the purpose of flutes to be played well, and to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians. This is closest to option B, but the actual answer is not among the options.

However, another generated MCQ is even more similar:

**Question 3 is not the correct match, but Question 4 was not the best match either**

provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity he says I'm a great golfer I want to compete but I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose you were on the Supreme Court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case how many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn't let's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of Casey Martin and how many would not how many would say he doesn't have all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart what would be your reason raise your hand and we'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart all right those of you I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worried about an unfair advantage what about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes all right what's your name Charley says well get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us Charley why why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart but what about walking from hole to hole it doesn't matter it's not part of the game walking the course is not part of the game of golf not in my opinion all right stay there Charley who has an answer who has an answer for chart by the way all right who has an answer for Charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game walking all those holes walking all those holes that's part of part of the game of golf absolutely what's your name Warren Warren Charlie what do you say to war I'll stick to my original thesis well we're on our you golf er I'm not a golfer and I am okay you know it's interesting in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with Warren they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting well by I should tell you how the Supreme Court refers the Supreme Court decided what are you suppose they said they said yes that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf and the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question and justice Stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf and the essential point of the game is to get a very small ball from one place into a hole and as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was Justice Scalia he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion he said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf here's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of the games arbitrary rules is essential so there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way if we thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game it's also objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness on what's an unfair advantage but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be let everyone write in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been I suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA even than making an exception for Casey Martin why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point that's delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in the golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that with golf as with flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what quality is what excellence is connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same-sex marriage there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only and how many favor the second same-sex marriage now put it this way what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about so with flutes with golf carts and even with a few sleek intested question like same-sex marriage aristotle has a point very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve elevate the terms of political discourse in the United States and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring the civic life it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much okay okay okay so from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage that was genius Lee now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series is one of the first to do a big what's your vision for the next phase of this well I think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments and some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and I think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in China in India in Africa around the world to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate so you picture at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from China and India joining in right we did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach and we do it in the classroom at Harvard with about a thousand students wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in Beijing and in Mumbai and in Cambridge Massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what I would love to do so I would imagine I would imagine that there are a lot of people would love to join you on that endeavor Michael Sandel thank you so much thanks

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Why does Aristotle think the best flute players should get the best flutes?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about what Aristotle says is essential when thinking about justice, and the correct answer is "the nature of the activity in question" and "the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring." Question 4 is related to this concept, as it asks about Aristotle's reasoning for distributing flutes, which is an example of thinking about justice.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but it would be better to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument which would think if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of Congress I have a suggestion look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same-sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens Aristotle's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so you ready for the lecture according to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that's that's it that's the lecture now you may say well that's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones let's see what people what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out at random you would do it by lottery or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them well the best flute players the worst flute players how many say the best flute players why why should the best flute actually that was Aristotle's answer to but here's a harder question why do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players who's the greatest benefit to all will hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players that's Peter alright well it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music has played rather than terrible music but Peter Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said that's what flutes are for to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or of the social activity in this case musical performance and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it will be a happy by-product that we'll all benefit but when we think about justice Aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case let's take a contemporary example of a dispute about justice had to do with golf Casey Martin a few years ago Casey Martin did any of you hear about him he is a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury he asked the PGA the Professional Golfers Association for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments they said no no that would give you an unfair advantage he sued and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court believe it or not the case over the golf cart because the law says the distance that the disabled must be accommodated

an answer for chart by the way all right who has an answer for Charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game walking all those holes walking all those holes that's part of part of the game of golf absolutely what's your name Warren Warren Charlie what do you say to war I'll stick to my original thesis well we're on our you golf er I'm not a golfer and I am okay you know it's interesting in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with Warren they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting well by I should tell you how the Supreme Court refers the Supreme Court decided what are you suppose they said they said yes that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf and the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question and justice Stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf and the essential point of the game is to get a very small ball from one place into a hole and as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was Justice Scalia he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion he said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf here's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of the games arbitrary rules is essential so there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way if we thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game it's also objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness on what's an unfair advantage but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be let everyone write in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been I suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA even than making an exception for Casey Martin why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point that's delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in the golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that with golf as with flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what quality is what excellence is connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same-sex marriage there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only and how many favor the second same-sex marriage now put it this way what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about so with flutes with golf carts and even with a few sleek intested question like same-sex marriage aristotle has a point very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve elevate the terms of political discourse in the United States and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring the civic life it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much okay okay okay so from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage that was genius Lee now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series is one of the first to do a big what's your vision for the next phase of this well I think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments and some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and I think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in China in India in Africa around the world to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate so you picture at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from China and India joining in right we did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach and we do it in the classroom at Harvard with about a thousand students wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in Beijing and in Mumbai and in Cambridge Massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what I would love to do so I would imagine I would imagine that there are a lot of people would love to join you on that endeavor Michael Sandel thank you so much thanks

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

**Transcript**:
Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why do we see illusions? I'm going to tell you
about some of my research, where I provided evidence
for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers. At the center where
those radial lines are, it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it's a remarkably simple stimulus. It's just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe be unable to render
this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer
questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain
is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle
the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain
encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you've been encountering
this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina. They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version
of what happens in real life and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines
in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines. The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving. When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff, and it tells you
the direction you're moving. Alright, that's half the story. That's what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it's looking at the first image, that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center. It still doesn't explain why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand
that our brains are slow. What you would like
is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn't work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long, but it's a long time in normal behaviors. If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn't correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped
into it or just passed it. And of course, this
is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception
should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can't passively respond
and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess
about the next moment. What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you'll have a perception
of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain
this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving. What happens to them? Well, let's imagine. Imagine you've got a doorway. You've got a doorway. Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete -- it'll be helpful in a second. When you're very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens
when you get closer. It all flows outwards
in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you're really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more
like this next picture. The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem, there's just two vertical lines and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you're going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear
in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future, because they're just
static images on the page, they're not changing like in real life. And let me just end
by showing one illusion here. If I can, I'll quickly show two. This one's fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines, your brain says,
"They're probably already moving, that's why they're blurry." When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn't be moving that much. And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving. You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be. It's weird, right? But what you have now are the cues
that, from your brain's point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like,
"Oh, these things are moving." Render a perception
of what they'll do in the next moment -- they should be moving
and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much. (Applause)

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why do we see illusions? I'm going to tell you
about some of my research, where I provided evidence
for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers. At the center where
those radial lines are, it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it's a remarkably simple stimulus. It's just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe be unable to render
this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer
questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain
is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle
the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain
encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you've been encountering
this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina. They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version
of what happens in real life and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines
in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines. The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving. When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff, and it tells you
the direction you're moving. Alright, that's half the story. That's what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it's looking at the first image, that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center. It still doesn't explain why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand
that our brains are slow. What you would like
is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn't work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long, but it's a long time in normal behaviors. If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn't correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped
into it or just passed it. And of course, this
is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception
should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can't passively respond
and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess
about the next moment. What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you'll have a perception
of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain
this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving. What happens to them? Well, let's imagine. Imagine you've got a doorway. You've got a doorway. Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete -- it'll be helpful in a second. When you're very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens
when you get closer. It all flows outwards
in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you're really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more
like this next picture. The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem, there's just two vertical lines and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you're going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear
in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future, because they're just
static images on the page, they're not changing like in real life. And let me just end
by showing one illusion here. If I can, I'll quickly show two. This one's fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines, your brain says,
"They're probably already moving, that's why they're blurry." When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn't be moving that much. And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving. You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be. It's weird, right? But what you have now are the cues
that, from your brain's point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like,
"Oh, these things are moving." Render a perception
of what they'll do in the next moment -- they should be moving
and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much. (Applause)

are suggesting that I'm moving. What happens to them? Well, let's imagine. Imagine you've got a doorway. You've got a doorway. Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete -- it'll be helpful in a second. When you're very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens
when you get closer. It all flows outwards
in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you're really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more
like this next picture. The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem, there's just two vertical lines and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you're going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear
in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future, because they're just
static images on the page, they're not changing like in real life. And let me just end
by showing one illusion here. If I can, I'll quickly show two. This one's fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines, your brain says,
"They're probably already moving, that's why they're blurry." When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn't be moving that much. And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving. You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be. It's weird, right? But what you have now are the cues
that, from your brain's point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like,
"Oh, these things are moving." Render a perception
of what they'll do in the next moment -- they should be moving
and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why do we see illusions? I'm going to tell you
about some of my research, where I provided evidence
for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers. At the center where
those radial lines are, it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it's a remarkably simple stimulus. It's just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe be unable to render
this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer
questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain
is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle
the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain
encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you've been encountering
this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina. They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version
of what happens in real life and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines
in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines. The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving. When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff, and it tells you
the direction you're moving. Alright, that's half the story. That's what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it's looking at the first image, that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center. It still doesn't explain why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand
that our brains are slow. What you would like
is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn't work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long, but it's a long time in normal behaviors. If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn't correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped
into it or just passed it. And of course, this
is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception
should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can't passively respond
and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess
about the next moment. What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you'll have a perception
of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain
this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving. What happens to them? Well, let's imagine. Imagine you've got a doorway. You've got a doorway. Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete -- it'll be helpful in a second. When you're very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens

in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you're really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more
like this next picture. The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem, there's just two vertical lines and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you're going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear
in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future, because they're just

by showing one illusion here. If I can, I'll quickly show two. This one's fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I've added blur

**Transcript**:
let's say Jack holds both balls above his head and then he drops them at exactly the same time what do you expect to see well they're going to hit the ground at the same time I expect them to both land at the same time the same time same time this one to hit the ground first however they will actually both hit the ground at the same time why is that science yeah science now the black one clearly feels a lot heavier so the standard misconception is to believe that the black ball will accelerate at a greater rate and reach the ground first this year many people had an idea that both balls would land at the same time but they didn't know exactly why I found there were some different misconceptions for example many people seem to think that as an object falls towards the Earth it falls with a constant speed from this hot yeah pretty much just a constant speed all the way down speed yeah I think it'll be the same constant speed I think it's constant I seem to remember it being constant I did decently in physics and I se to remember that's the answer whereas the truth is the speed of both balls is changing all the time the balls are speeding up as they go towards the ground that's what the force of gravity does on them it makes them accelerate it gets them to speed up another misconception I discovered was that some people believe both balls should have the same gravitational force on them even though the black ball is clearly much much heavier the reason I think they said this was because they knew both balls needed to reach the ground at the same time so they reasoned that the force on them must be the same tell me about how the gravitational force on this ball compares to the gravitational force on that ball the force is the same it's going to be very similar in terms of gravitational pool they're both have the same and they'll fall at the same rate I'm not like Einstein but same gravitational force around the whole world right cuz the gravitational pull on the earth is the same on both objects are you saying that the force on them is the same the pull is the same but you felt the pole and you've told me the pole is different no I said the weight is different I didn't say the pole is different it is heavier and has more gravitational pull but when I drop them then they get equal a gravitational pull somehow don't you think it's going to be like five times as much yeah you think but it's not the way you're asking it yes but scientifically speaking no the gravitational force on both these fors are the same okay the gravitational force on both of these BS is the same is that what you actually believe no but it is tell me tell me what you believe I believe it should be more on this simply for the fact that this is heavier and just intuition tells me that should be more but after learning physics we learn that it is actually the same I actually think the force on this ball is more the force on this I I swear I'm not trying to mess with you so like in in real life in real life and in physics I will tell you that the force on this ball is more all right ready three two one yep see same time same time same time I would say the force on the medicine ball is like a lot more because it's got a lot more weight it's got a lot more mass but it's got a lot more inertia yeah yeah oh you guys remember that right it's got a lot of resistance to acceleration so it takes more Force to get it accelerating at the same rate as this ball and that's why they accelerate at the same rate thank you guys so much for playing along I appreciate that sorry it's all right

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet. It's like a 500 megapixel camera that can run in bright light, in near darkness, and even under water, though not real well. It communicates to our brains so much about the world. Our eyes are how we find partners, how we understand the people around us, how we read, and how we watch game shows on TV where people get knocked into cold water by padded wrecking balls. Yup, the human eye is pretty neat, and we're lucky enough to have two of them. But, there are things that, despite looking really hard, we still can't quite see. For example, you can watch a horse galloping, but your eyes can't keep up with its fast-moving hooves enough to figure out whether all four feet are ever off the ground simultaneously. For these types of questions, we need cameras. About 150 years ago, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge used one to solve the galloping horse mystery. Using careful photography, Muybridge proved that at certain points as it gallops, a horse really is flying. "Look, ma! No hooves!" Since then, photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science. It enhances our understanding of a world we thought we could already see, but it's one which we really need help to see a little better. It's not always a matter of the world moving by too quickly for our eyes to process. Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements that are too small for the naked eye. Botanists use multiple photographs to show the life cycle of plants and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours to follow the sun in what is called phototropism, growing towards the light. Mathematicians have used photos to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier. Meteorologists and environmental scientists show the growth of major hurricanes and the recession over the years of many of the world's glaciers. Slow-motion film or high-speed photography have shown us the beating of a hummingbird's wings and the course of a bullet through its target. In one project, cadavers, that's dead bodies, were frozen and sliced into thousands of wafer-thin discs. The discs were photographed to produced animated movies that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton, and into the flesh, and through the bones, and the veins, and, perhaps I should have suggested you don't watch this during dinner, my bad. In classrooms today, the camera, now present in just about every phone and computer, allows the youngest scientists to observe the world around them, to document it, and to share their findings online. Whether it's the change of seasons or the growth of the germinating seed, cameras are allowing us to see a beautiful world through new eyes.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The human eye is one of the most powerful machines on the planet. It's like a 500 megapixel camera that can run in bright light, in near darkness, and even under water, though not real well. It communicates to our brains so much about the world. Our eyes are how we find partners, how we understand the people around us, how we read, and how we watch game shows on TV where people get knocked into cold water by padded wrecking balls. Yup, the human eye is pretty neat, and we're lucky enough to have two of them. But, there are things that, despite looking really hard, we still can't quite see. For example, you can watch a horse galloping, but your eyes can't keep up with its fast-moving hooves enough to figure out whether all four feet are ever off the ground simultaneously. For these types of questions, we need cameras. About 150 years ago, the photographer Eadweard Muybridge used one to solve the galloping horse mystery. Using careful photography, Muybridge proved that at certain points as it gallops, a horse really is flying. "Look, ma! No hooves!" Since then, photography has found its way into all aspects of math and science. It enhances our understanding of a world we thought we could already see, but it's one which we really need help to see a little better. It's not always a matter of the world moving by too quickly for our eyes to process. Sometimes cameras can help us see matter or movements that are too small for the naked eye. Botanists use multiple photographs to show the life cycle of plants and how flowers turn over the course of a few hours to follow the sun in what is called phototropism, growing towards the light. Mathematicians have used photos to look at where in the twists and turns of a whip the crack sound comes when the whip is breaking the sound barrier. Meteorologists and environmental scientists show the growth of major hurricanes and the recession over the years of many of the world's glaciers. Slow-motion film or high-speed photography have shown us the beating of a hummingbird's wings and the course of a bullet through its target. In one project, cadavers, that's dead bodies, were frozen and sliced into thousands of wafer-thin discs. The discs were photographed to produced animated movies that allow a viewer to travel up and down the skeleton, and into the flesh, and through the bones, and the veins, and, perhaps I should have suggested you don't watch this during dinner, my bad.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe, rather beautiful, isn't it? It's quite literally got everything, from the very big to the very small. Sure, there are some less
than savory elements in there, but on the whole,
scholars agree that its existence is probably a good thing. Such a good thing that
an entire field of scientific endeavor is devoted to its study. This is known as cosmology. Cosmologists look
at what's out there in space and piece together the tale
of how our universe evolved: what it's doing now, what it's going to be doing, and how it all began in the first place. It was Edwin Hubble who first noticed
that our universe is expanding, by noting that galaxies seem to be flying
further and further apart. This implied that everything
should have started with the monumental explosion of an infinitely hot, infinitely small point. This idea was jokingly
referred to at the time as the "Big Bang," but as the evidence piled up, the notion and the name actually stuck. We know that after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down to form the stars and galaxies
that we see today. Cosmologists have plenty of ideas
about how this happened. But we can also probe
the origins of the universe by recreating the hot, dense conditions
that existed at the beginning of time in the laboratory. This is done by particle physicists. Over the past century, particle physicists have been studying matter and forces
at higher and higher energies. Firstly with cosmic rays, and then with particle accelerators, machines that smash together
subatomic particles at great energies. The greater the energy of the accelerator, the further back in time
they can effectively peek. Today, things are largely
made up of atoms, but hundreds of seconds
after the Big Bang, it was too hot for electrons to join
atomic nuclei to make atoms. Instead, the universe consisted
of a swirling sea of subatomic matter. A few seconds after the Big Bang, it was hotter still, hot enough to overpower the forces that usually hold protons
and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. Further back, microseconds
after the Big Bang, and the protons and neutrons were only just beginning
to form from quarks, one of the fundamental building blocks of the standard model of particle physics. Further back still, and the energy was too great
even for the quarks to stick together. Physicists hope that by going
to even greater energies, they can see back to a time
when all the forces were one and the same, which would make understanding the origins of the universe a lot easier. To do that, they'll not only need
to build bigger colliders, but also work hard
to combine our knowledge of the very, very big with the very, very small and share these fascinating
insights with each other and with, well, you. And that's how it should be! Because, after all,
when it comes to our universe, we're all in this one together.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How did we first work out that the universe was expanding?

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar The universe, rather beautiful, isn't it? It's quite literally got everything, from the very big to the very small. Sure, there are some less
than savory elements in there, but on the whole,
scholars agree that its existence is probably a good thing. Such a good thing that
an entire field of scientific endeavor is devoted to its study. This is known as cosmology. Cosmologists look
at what's out there in space and piece together the tale
of how our universe evolved: what it's doing now, what it's going to be doing, and how it all began in the first place. It was Edwin Hubble who first noticed
that our universe is expanding, by noting that galaxies seem to be flying
further and further apart. This implied that everything
should have started with the monumental explosion of an infinitely hot, infinitely small point. This idea was jokingly
referred to at the time as the "Big Bang," but as the evidence piled up, the notion and the name actually stuck. We know that after the Big Bang, the universe cooled down to form the stars and galaxies
that we see today. Cosmologists have plenty of ideas
about how this happened. But we can also probe
the origins of the universe by recreating the hot, dense conditions
that existed at the beginning of time in the laboratory. This is done by particle physicists. Over the past century, particle physicists have been studying matter and forces
at higher and higher energies. Firstly with cosmic rays, and then with particle accelerators, machines that smash together
subatomic particles at great energies. The greater the energy of the accelerator, the further back in time
they can effectively peek. Today, things are largely
made up of atoms, but hundreds of seconds
after the Big Bang, it was too hot for electrons to join
atomic nuclei to make atoms. Instead, the universe consisted
of a swirling sea of subatomic matter. A few seconds after the Big Bang, it was hotter still, hot enough to overpower the forces that usually hold protons
and neutrons together in atomic nuclei. Further back, microseconds
after the Big Bang, and the protons and neutrons were only just beginning
to form from quarks, one of the fundamental building blocks of the standard model of particle physics. Further back still, and the energy was too great
even for the quarks to stick together. Physicists hope that by going
to even greater energies, they can see back to a time
when all the forces were one and the same, which would make understanding the origins of the universe a lot easier. To do that, they'll not only need
to build bigger colliders, but also work hard
to combine our knowledge of the very, very big with the very, very small and share these fascinating
insights with each other and with, well, you. And that's how it should be! Because, after all,
when it comes to our universe, we're all in this one together.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How do we know that all of the fundamental forces of nature will simplify into one force at a very high energy?
Options: A. All of the experimental evidence we have obtained so far suggests that some of the different forces we know about are actually the same force if you go to high enough energies, and we expect this trend to continue., B. The physics of the universe must be described by a simple, elegant mathematical equation – and one force is simpler than four forces., C. We don’t know this at all – if we want to test this hypothesis, we’ll have to build bigger particle accelerators to further our understanding of the universe.
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the goal of physicists in building bigger colliders and studying higher energies?
Options: A. To understand the origins of life on Earth, B. To understand the origins of the universe, C. To understand the behavior of black holes, D. To understand the properties of dark matter
Correct Option: None

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

[Music] [Music] I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Music] I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it

mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank [Applause] you

[Music] [Music] I think the beautiful Mullen put it perfectly every man deserves the opportunity to grow a little bit of luxury ladies and gentlemen more importantly Mo Bros and mo sisters for the next 70 minutes I'm going to share with you my movember journey and how through that Journey we've redefined charity we're redefining the way prostate cancer researchers are working together throughout the world and I hope through that process that I inspire you to create something significant in your life something significant that will go on and make this world a better place so the most common question I get asked I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it over drinks tonight uh is how did this come about how did movember start well normally a charity starts with the cause and someone that is directly affected by a cause they then go on to create an event and beyond that a foundation to support that pretty much in every case that's how a charity starts not so with movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of

movember movember started in a very traditional Australian way was on a Sunday afternoon afternoon it was my brother and a mate having a few beers and they watching the world go by had a few more beers and I had the conversation turned to 70s fashion and how everything manages to come back into style there's a few more beers so there has to be some stuff that hasn't come back then want more beer and it was whatever happened to the mustache why hasn't that made a comeback so there's a lot more beers and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back so in Australia MO is slang from mustach so we renamed the month November movember and created some pretty basic rules which still stand today and they are start the month clean shaving Rock a mustache not a beard not a goatey a mustache for the 30 days of November and then we agreed that we would come together at the end of the month have a mustache theme party and award a prize for the best and of course the worst mustache now trust me when you're growing a mustache back in 2003 and there were 30 of us back then and this is before the ironic uh hipster mustache [Laughter] movement amazing it created a lot of controversy so my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients my girlfriend at the time who's no longer my girlfriend hated it parents would Shuffle kids away from us but we came together at the end of the month and we celebrated our journey and it was a real journey and uh we had a lot of fun and in 2014 I said to the guys that was so much fun we need to legitimize this so we can get away with it year on year so we started thinking about that and we were inspired by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer we thought you know what there's nothing for Men's Health why is that why why can't we combine growing a mustache and do something for men's health and I started to research that topic and discovered prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer in terms of the number of men that die from it and diagnosed with it but there was nothing for this cause so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer and then we created our tagline which is changing the face of men's health and that eloquently describes a challenge changing your appearance for the 30 days and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve getting men engaged in their health having them have a better understanding about the health risk that they face so with that model I then uh cold C the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation I said to him I've got the most amazing idea that's going to transform your organization and I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne in 2004 and we sat down and I shared with you my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia raising awareness for this cause and funds for his organization and I needed a partnership to legitimately do that and I said we're going to come together at the end we're going to have a mustache themed party we're going to have DJs we're going to celebrate life and we're going to change the face of men's health and he just looked at me and laughed and he said he said Adam that's a really novel idea but we're an Ultra conservative organization we can't have anything to do with you so I paid for coffee that day and uh his parting comment as we shook hands was listen if you happen to raise any money out of this we'll gladly take it so my lesson that year was persistence and we persisted and we got 450 guys growing m SES and together we raised $54,000 and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and that represented at the time the single biggest donation they'd ever received so from that day forward my life has become about a mustache every day this morning I wake up and go my life is about a mustache essentially I'm a mustache farmer and my season is November so in 2005 the campaign uh got more momentum was more successful in Australia and than New Zealand um and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal Point uh we we it was consuming so much of our time after hours on weekends that we thought we either need to close this down or figure a way to fund movember so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time in the organization and take it to the next level it's really interesting when you try and figure a way to fund a fundraising organization built off growing mustaches let me tell you there's not too many people interested in investing in that not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation who had raised about $1.2 million for at that stage so again we persisted and fosters Brewing came to the party and gave us our first ever uh sponsorship and that was enough for me to quit my job I salting on the side and leading into movember uh 2006 we'd run through all the money from Fosters we'd run through all the money I had and essentially we had no money left and we convinced all our suppliers creative agencies web development agencies hosting companies whatnot to delay their billing until December so we' racked up at this stage about $600,000 worth of uh debt so if November 2006 didn't happen the four Founders well we would have been broke we would have been homeless sitting on the street with mustaches but we thought you know what if that's the worst thing that happens so what we're going to have a lot of fun doing it and it taught us the importance of taking risks and really smart risks then in early 2007 a really interesting thing happened we had MOS from from Canada from the US and from the UK emailing us and calling us and saying hey there's nothing for prostate cancer bring this campaign to these countries so we thought why not let's do it so I Cole called the CEO of prostate cancer Canada and I said to him I have this most amazing concept it's going to transform your organization I don't want to tell you about it now but will you meet with me if I fly all the way to Toronto so I flew here met down on Front Street East and we sat in the boardroom I said right here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization and he looked at me and laughed and said Adam sounds like a really novel idea but we're an ultra conservative organization I've heard this before I know what I know how it goes uh but he said we will partner with you but we're not going to invest in it you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work so what we did was we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country the US and UK and we did that because we knew if this was successful we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia and that money fuels research and that research will get us to a cure we're not about finding an Australian cure or a Canadian cure we're about finding the Cure so in 2007 uh we brought the campaign across here and it was it set the stage um for the campaign it wasn't as successful as we thought it would be we were sort of very gung-ho with our success in Australia and New Zealand at that stage so that year really taught us the importance of being patient and really understanding the local market before you become so bold as to set lofty targets but what I'm really pleased to say is in 2010 movember became a truly Global movement Canada was just pipped at the post in terms of the number one fundraising campaign in the world last year we had 450,000 mobos spread across the world and together we raise $77 million and that makes November now the biggest funer of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world and that is an amazing achievement when you think about us growing mustaches and for us we have redefined charity our ribbon is a hairy ribbon [Applause] our ambassadors are the mo Bros and the mo sisters and I think that's been fundamental to Our Success we hand across our brand and our campaign to those people we let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way so now I live in in Los Angeles because the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the US is based there and I always get asked by the media down there because it's so celebrity D driven who are your celebrity ambassadors and I say to them last year we're fortunate enough to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors what what do you mean it's like every single person every single moo and mo sister that participates in movember is our celebrity Ambassador and that is so so important and fundamental to Our Success now what I want to share with you is one of my most touching uh movember moments and it happened here in Toronto last year at the end of the uh campaign uh I was out with a team it was the end of movember we'd had a great campaign and to Hon us we'd had our Fair sh of beer that night but I said you know what I think we've got one more bar left in us so we piled into a taxi and this is our taxi driver and I was sitting in the back seat and he turned around and said where you going I said Hy on that is an amazing mustache and he said I'm doing it for movember and I said so am I why and I said uh tell me your movember story and he goes listen I know it's about Men's Health I know it's about prostate cancer but this is for breast cancer I said okay that's interesting he goes last year my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her and he said this mustache is my tribute to my mom and we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi and I didn't tell him who I was cuz I didn't think it was appropriate and I just shook his hand I said thank you so much your mom would be so proud and from that moment I realized that movember is so much more than a mustache having a joke it's about each person coming to this platform embracing it in their own way and being significant in their own life for us now at movember we really focus on three program areas and having a true impact awareness and education Survivor support programs and research now we always Focus naturally on how much we raise because it's a very tangible outcome but for me awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise because I know that is changing and saving lives today it's probably best exampled by uh a young guy that I met at South by Southwest in Austin Texas at the start of the year he came up to me and said thank you for starting movember I said thank you for doing movember I looked at him I was like I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache and I said what's your movember story and he said I grew the worst mustache ever but I went home for Thanksgiving dinner and pretty quickly the conversation around the table turned to what the hell was going on and weal I I I talked to them about movember and then after that my dad came up to me and at the age of 26 for the first time ever I had a conversation with my dad one-on-one about Men's Health I had a conversation with my dad about prostate cancer learned that my grandfather had prostate cancer and I was able to share with my dad that he was twice as likely to get that disease and he didn't know that and he hadn't been getting screened for it so now that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer so those conversations getting men engaged in this at whatever age is so critically important and in my view so much more important than the funds we raise now to the funds we raise and research and how we're redefining research we fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of Institutions and researchers around the world and when we looked at this more recently we realized there's a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions little alone nationally little alone globally and this is not unique to prostate cancer this is this is cancer research the world over and so we said right we redefine charity we need to redefine the way these guys operate how do we do that so what we did was we created our Global action plan we're taking 10% of what's raised in each country now and putting it into a global fund we've got the best prostate cancer scientific Minds in the world that look after that fund and they come together each year and identify the number one priority and that last year was getting a better screening test so they identified that as a priority and then they've gone and recruited now through 300 researchers from around the world that are studying that topic essentially the same topic so now we're funding them to the tune of about 5 or six million dollars to collaborate and bringing them together and that's a unique thing in the cancer world and we know through that collaboration it will accelerate outcomes and that's how we're redefining the research world so what I know about my member journey is that with a really creative idea with passion with persistence and a lot of patients for mates for mustaches can inspire a room full of people and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city and that city is Melbourne my home and that City can go on and inspire a state and that state can go on and inspire a nation and beyond that you can create a global movement that is changing the face of men's health my name is Adam gon and that's my story thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] think about your day for a second you woke up felt fresh air in your face as you walked out the door encountered new colleagues and had great discussions and felt in awe when you found something new but I bet there's something that you didn't think about today something so close to home that you probably don't think about it very often at all and that's that all those Sensations feelings decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called your brain now the brain may not look like much from the outside a couple pounds of pinkish gray flesh amorphous but the last 100 years of Neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain and to see the intricacy of what lies within and they've told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons now unlike a human design computer where there's a fairly small number of different parts we know how they work because we humans design them the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cell maybe tens of thousands they come in different shapes they're made out of different molecules and they project and connect to different brain regions and they also change different ways in different disease States just to make it concrete there's a class of cells a fairly small cell an inhibitory cell that quiets its neighbors it's one of the cells that seem to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia called the basket cell and this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about new ones are being discovered every day as just a second example these paramal cells large cells they can span a significant fraction of the brain they're excitatory and these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device they receive inputs from thousands of Upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs which then if they pass a certain threshold will go to thousands of Downstream partners and this process which takes just you know a millisecond or so happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells as long as you live and think and feel so how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ideally we could go through this circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which TS go wrong in certain pathologies if we could activate cells we can see what powers they can unleash what they can initiate and sustain if we can turn them off then we could try and figure out what they're necessary for and that's the story I'm going to tell you about today an odyssey where we've gone through over the last 11 years through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and Pathways of the brain on and off both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans now before I tell you out the technology the bad news is that uh a significant fraction of us in this room if we live long enough will encounter perhaps a brain disorder um already a billion people have had uh some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them and the numbers don't do it justice though these disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer's depression addiction they not only steal away our time to live they change who we are they take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people now in the 20th century there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders practically none of them can be considered to be cured and in part that's because if you think about it we're bathing the brain in a chemical this elaborate circuit made out of thousands different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance that's also why perhaps most of the drugs not all on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too now some people have gotten some Solus from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain and for Parkinson's Disease cular implants these have indeed been able to uh bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder but uh electricity also will go in all directions the path of leas resistance which is kind of where that phrase in part comes from and it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix so again we're sent back to the idea of ultra control could we dial in information precisely where we want it to go so when I started in Neuroscience 11 years ago I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist and the first thing I thought about was well if these neurons are electrical devices all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance if we could turn on the electricity in one cell but not its neighbors that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells to figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they're embedded and also it allow us to have the ultra precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone aride now how we're going to do that well there are many molecules that exist in nature which are able to convert light into electricity you can think them as little proteins that are like solar cells if we install these molecules in neurons somehow then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light and their neighbors which don't have this molecule would not there's one other magic trick you need to make this all happen and that's a to get light into the brain and to do that the brain doesn't feel pain you can put taking advantage of all the effort that's gone into the internet in telecomunications and so on optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate in animal models for example in preclinical studies these neurons and to see what they do so how do we do this around 2004 in collaboration with gir ngle and Carl dth this Vision came to fruition there's a certain alga that swims in the wild and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally and it senses light with a little eye spot which works not unlike how our Eye Works in its membrane or its boundary it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity so these molecules are called Channel opsins and each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about when blue light hits it it opens up a little hole and allows charge particles to enter the ice spot and that allows this ice spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery so what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons and because it's a protein it's encoded for in the DNA of this organism so all we got to do is take that DNA put it into a gene therapy Vector like a virus and put it into neurons so turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy and lots of viruses were coming along so this turned out to be fairly simple to do and early in the morning uh one day in the summer of 2004 we give it a try and it worked on the first try you take this TNA and you put into the neuron the neuron uses its natural protein making Machinery to fabricate these little light sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell like putting solar panels on a roof and the next thing you know you have a neuron which can be activated with light so this is very powerful one of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors right and you can do that you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others and there's genetic tricks you can play in order to get light activated cells this field has now come to be known as optogenetics and just as one example of the kind of thing you can do you can take a complex Network use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense Network and then when you shine light on the entire network just that cell type will be activated so for example let's consider that basket cell I told you about earlier the one that's atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory if we can deliver that Gene into these cells and they're not being altered by the expression of the gene of course and then Flash Blue Light over the entire brain Network just these cells are going to be driven and when the light turns off these cells go back to normal so there don't seem to be Adverse Events to that not only can use this to study what these cells do what their power is in Computing in the brain but you can also use this to try and figure out well maybe we could Jazz up the activity these cells if indeed they're atrophy now I want to tell you a couple short stories about how we're using this both at the scientific clinical and preclinical levels one of the questions that we've confronted is what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward because if you could find those those would be some of the signals that can drive learning right the brain will do more of whatever got that reward and also these are signals that go arry in disorders such as addiction so if we could figure out which cells they are we can maybe find new targets for which drugs can be designed or screened against or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability so to do that we came with a very simple Paradigm in collaboration with the filla group where one side of this little box if the animal goes there the animal gets a pulse of light and we're to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light so if these cells can mediate reward the animal should go there more and more and so that's what happens this animal is going to go to the right hand side and poke his nose there and he gets a flash of blue light every times it does that and it'll do that hundreds and hundreds of times these are the dopamine neurons which some of you may have heard about as some of the pleasure centers in the brain now we've shown that a brief activation of these is enough indeed to drive learning now we can generalize the idea instead of one point in the brain we can devices that span the brain that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns arrays of optical fibers each coupled to its own independent miniature light source and then we can try to do things in Vivo that have only been done to date in a dish like highit screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders and one St I want to tell you about is how can we find Targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear and one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear this goes back you know back to the pavlovian days and it's called pavlovian fear conditioning where a tone ends with a brief shock the shock isn't painful but it's a little Annoying and over time in this case a mouse which is a good animal model commonly used in such experiments the animal learns to fear the tone the animal react by freezing sort of like a deer in the headlights now the question is what Targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear so what we do is we play that tone again after it's been associated with fear but we activate Targets in the brain different ones using that optical fiber I told you about on the previous slide in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear and so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we're working on now this is an area in the prefontal cortex a region where we can use cognition to try and overcome aversive emotional states and they almost going to hear a tone and the Flash of light occurred there there's no audio on this but you can see the animals freezing this tone used to mean bad news and there's a little clock in the lower Le hand corner so you can see that this animal is about 2 minutes into this and now this next clip is just 8 minutes later and the same tone going to play and the light's going to flash again okay there it goes right uh now and now you can see just 10 minutes into the experiment that we've equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this sphere memory now over the last couple years we've gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off if we could do that this could be extremely powerful if you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds seconds you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circus of which they're embedded and we've now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life every Kingdom of life except for Animals we see swh differently and we found all sorts of molecules they're called Halo adops and arur adops which respond to green and yellow light and they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before the blue light activator Chan opposite let's give an example of where we think this is going to go consider for example a condition like epilepsy where the brain is is overactive now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain but that's obviously irreversible and there could be side effects what if we could just turn off that brain for the brief amount of time until the seizure dies away and cause the brain to be restored to its initial State sort of like a dynamical system that's being coaxed down into a stable State this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light and we beam light in and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure we're hoping to be able to turn it on and so we don't have data to show you in this front but we're very excited about this now I want to close in one story which we think is another possibility which is that maybe these molecules if you can do ultra precise control could be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic an optical prosthetic I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon 75,000 people have Parkinson's deep brain stimulators implanted maybe 100,000 people have coar implants which allow them to hear there's another thing which you got to get these genes into cells and New Hope and gene therapy has been developed because there viruses like the adinos associated virus which probably most of us around this room have and it doesn't have any symptoms which have been used in hundreds of patients deliver genes into the brain or the body and so far there have not been serious Adverse Events associated with the virus there's one last Alpha in the room the proteins themselves which come from algae and bacteria and funguses and all over the Tree of Life most of us don't have funguses or algae in our brain so what is our brain going to do if we put that in are the cells going to tolerate it will the immune system react it's early days these have not been done in humans yet but we're working a variety of studies to try and examine this and so far we haven't seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to these um the illumination of the brain with light so it's early days to up front but we're excited about it I want to close in one story which we think could potentially be a clinical application now there are many forms of blindness where the photo receptors our light sensors that are in the back of our eye are gone and the retina of course is a complex structure let's zoom in on it here so we can kind of see it in more detail the photo receptor cells are shown here at the top and then the signals that are detected by the photo receptors are transformed through various computations until finally that layer cells at the bottom the gangling cells relay the information to the brain where we see that as perception in many forms of blindness like right Pigmentosa or macro degeneration the photo receptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed now how could you repair this it's not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored because there's nothing with the drug to bind to on other hand light can still get into the eye right the eye is still transparent and you can get light in so what if we could just take these Channel adops and other molecules and install them on some of these other spared cells and convert them into little cameras and because there's so many of these cells in the eye potentially they could be very high resolution cameras so this is some work that we're doing it's being both led by one of our collaborators Alan hoger at USC and being sought to be commercialized by a startup company EOS Neuroscience which is funded by the NIH and what you see see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze it's a six arm Maze and there's a bit of water in the Maze to motivate the mouse to move where he'll just sit there and the goal of course of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that's under the lit top Port now mice are smart so this mouse solves the maze eventually but he does a Brute Force search he's swimming down every Avenue until he finally gets to the platform so he's not using Vision to do it these different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that that affect humans and so we're being careful and trying to look at these different models so we with a generalized approach so how we going to solve this well we're going to do exactly what we outl the previous slide we're going to take these blue light photosensors and install them onto a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive light is converted to electricity on them so this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and receive one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus and now you can see the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to the platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again and to point out the power of this these animals are able to get to that platform just as fast as animals have seen their entire life so this preclinical study I think bodess hope for the kinds of things we're hoping to do in the future to close I want to point out that we're also exploring new business models for this new field of neurot Technology we're developing these tools but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world so people can study and try to treat different disorders and our hope is that by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them we can take some of these attractable disorders that I told you about earlier practically none of which are cured and in the 21st century make them history thank you so some of the stuff is a little dense but the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs and being able to Target this specifically is a first step the second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors mhm like an onoff switch that's right which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code right yeah so with blue light we can drive information in this form of a one and by turning things off it's more like zero so our hope is to eventually build Co brain co-processors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in in people with disabilities and in theory that means that as a mouse feels smells hears touches you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros sure yeah we're hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings and use that to understand more about the brain does that mean that someday you could download Memories and maybe upload them well it's something we're starting to work on very hard yeah we're we're now working on um some work where we're trying to tile the brain with recording elements too so we can record information and then drive information back in sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing well that might change a couple of things thank you thank [Applause] you

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar There has never been a time to make things as good as right now. Between what's available on the Internet, like the stuff on YouTube, the stuff on Instructables, MAKE Magazine, between the quality of your teachers who know so much and the incredible availability of parts, and tools, and supplies, there's almost nothing that you can't make, almost nothing you can't make, if you really try. Now in my career, I've made a lot of stuff. I've made telescopes, I've made microscopes, I know people who made electron microscopes. I personally made flamethrowers. I made a four-story high trebuchet. Um, I've made some really dangerous stuff. My favorite is I made a battlebot when battlebots were kind of big. You know, it was metal, it had 20 horsepower motors, it had a carbon-tip fireman cut-off saw in the front. That thing could, you know, eat its way out of a steel room. I've made just so many things. But not everything you have to make is dangerous to be cool. The point is, is that it's just fun to make stuff and if you've got a really good idea, you could probably do it. Now, there are different styles of making things. There's Do It Yourself and that's like, "Well, I'm going to fix the brakes on my car or put siding on my house," and that's an interesting kind of DIY. But there's hacking, where you take one item that's purposed for something else and turn it into something, you know, cooler, something different. There's bricolage, which means making things from found objects. There's kitting, which means you buy a kit, something complicated, probably, and put it together. And there's inventing, and inventing is the best! The best kind of making things involves not just following directions from people who have done things before, but actually going out there, figuring out how to make something, doing the design yourself, and then actually building it. Now, I don't have a lot of time, but I want to get you started on your own invention project, maybe. So what I'm going to do live and real-time and something that scares me, is, because it is live and real-time, is I'm going to make an audio speaker out of stuff that I found in my kitchen on the night before I came to New York. Okay. So what I've got here is a block of wood. I've got some sand paper. I've got some pieces of notebook paper folded up into a rough "Z" shape. I've got two magnets. And, I've got some wire. Now, this wire is the key part. The four things that I need to make my own speaker is a diaphragm, a coil, a support, and a magnet. So first thing's first. Let's start doing it. What I need to do is wind a coil. And what I'm going to do is take this wire and wind an entire voice coil from it. Now, unfortunately that's going to take a really long time, and I don't have much time, so I'm just going to give you the flavor of it. I'm going to take 30 gauge magnet wire and I'm just going to wrap it tightly together, and I'm going to do about 150 turns on a 3/4 inch wooden dowel. Now why would I do that? Because I want to get my coil to have about 4 ohms of resistance. If you don't have enough resistance, you can do something bad to your amplifier. And then once that's done, I'm going to glue it all together so it's nice and tight. Now I don't nearly have 150 coils there so I made one in advance and I'm going to use that one. So where is it? Here it is. What I'm going to do is simply hot glue it to the back of this yogurt cup. And I had to eat a lot of yogurt while I was experimenting, so I feel like I've got all the calcium I need for a while. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is take these magnets and glue it in the center of this dot. Hot glue, by the way, a hot glue gun, it's the greatest maker toy you can possibly have. I don't care what the 3-D prototype guys say, I love my hot glue gun! What I'm going to do next is take these little "Z" stand-offs, see? And I'm going to put some glue there. Look how fast that bonds! My god, this is great stuff! And I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to glue this. And I'm going to center that coil right over those magnets so it's just above it. And now it's done. Now this needs to dry. So you know how Martha Stewart would take the cake out of the oven, it's pre-made? We're going to do that, we're going to go to the Martha Stewart one. So this is the one I made earlier today. And it's the yogurt cup, the stand-offs, and everything else. Well, I'm going to turn on my iPod. We'll see if we get some music. I need a microphone. Hello? It's on, good deal. So, let's play something. [Music plays.] Now this is really coming from a yogurt cup and it's kind of a neat deal. Might not be your choice of music. Now you can experiment with different things. In fact, I did. Last night I did this. Let me walk over here. I made all these different speakers out of different things. Here's one. Because I'm in New York, I made one out of a piece of matzo. I made one out of a coffee cup lid. I made one out of a Tostito. The Tostito looks like a speaker, doesn't it? So, you can imagine how good that works. And then last night during rehearsals they gave us some food, and they gave us these thick potato chips. You've got to hear this, you guys. This is just incredible how nice that sounds. [Music plays.] It's just incredible. So anyway, like I said, today is the very best time, this age is the very best time to be a maker. You can make so many things if you put your mind to it. Get out there, pick something up because, I'll tell you, the stuff you make, the stuff you make is way better than the stuff you buy. It's special, it's significant to you, and I really encourage you to do that. Thanks a lot for listening to me.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar There has never been a time to make things as good as right now. Between what's available on the Internet, like the stuff on YouTube, the stuff on Instructables, MAKE Magazine, between the quality of your teachers who know so much and the incredible availability of parts, and tools, and supplies, there's almost nothing that you can't make, almost nothing you can't make, if you really try. Now in my career, I've made a lot of stuff. I've made telescopes, I've made microscopes, I know people who made electron microscopes. I personally made flamethrowers. I made a four-story high trebuchet. Um, I've made some really dangerous stuff. My favorite is I made a battlebot when battlebots were kind of big. You know, it was metal, it had 20 horsepower motors, it had a carbon-tip fireman cut-off saw in the front. That thing could, you know, eat its way out of a steel room. I've made just so many things. But not everything you have to make is dangerous to be cool. The point is, is that it's just fun to make stuff and if you've got a really good idea, you could probably do it. Now, there are different styles of making things. There's Do It Yourself and that's like, "Well, I'm going to fix the brakes on my car or put siding on my house," and that's an interesting kind of DIY. But there's hacking, where you take one item that's purposed for something else and turn it into something, you know, cooler, something different. There's bricolage, which means making things from found objects. There's kitting, which means you buy a kit, something complicated, probably, and put it together. And there's inventing, and inventing is the best! The best kind of making things involves not just following directions from people who have done things before, but actually going out there, figuring out how to make something, doing the design yourself, and then actually building it. Now, I don't have a lot of time, but I want to get you started on your own invention project, maybe. So what I'm going to do live and real-time and something that scares me, is, because it is live and real-time, is I'm going to make an audio speaker out of stuff that I found in my kitchen on the night before I came to New York. Okay. So what I've got here is a block of wood. I've got some sand paper. I've got some pieces of notebook paper folded up into a rough "Z" shape. I've got two magnets. And, I've got some wire. Now, this wire is the key part. The four things that I need to make my own speaker is a diaphragm, a coil, a support, and a magnet. So first thing's first. Let's start doing it. What I need to do is wind a coil. And what I'm going to do is take this wire and wind an entire voice coil from it. Now, unfortunately that's going to take a really long time, and I don't have much time, so I'm just going to give you the flavor of it. I'm going to take 30 gauge magnet wire and I'm just going to wrap it tightly together, and I'm going to do about 150 turns on a 3/4 inch wooden dowel. Now why would I do that? Because I want to get my coil to have about 4 ohms of resistance. If you don't have enough resistance, you can do something bad to your amplifier. And then once that's done, I'm going to glue it all together so it's nice and tight. Now I don't nearly have 150 coils there so I made one in advance and I'm going to use that one. So where is it? Here it is. What I'm going to do is simply hot glue it to the back of this yogurt cup. And I had to eat a lot of yogurt while I was experimenting, so I feel like I've got all the calcium I need for a while. Now, the next thing I'm going to do is take these magnets and glue it in the center of this dot. Hot glue, by the way, a hot glue gun, it's the greatest maker toy you can possibly have. I don't care what the 3-D prototype guys say, I love my hot glue gun! What I'm going to do next is take these little "Z" stand-offs, see? And I'm going to put some glue there. Look how fast that bonds! My god, this is great stuff! And I'm going to do that, and then I'm going to glue this. And I'm going to center that coil right over those magnets so it's just above it. And now it's done. Now this needs to dry. So you know how Martha Stewart would take the cake out of the oven, it's pre-made? We're going to do that, we're going to go to the Martha Stewart one. So this is the one I made earlier today. And it's the yogurt cup, the stand-offs, and everything else. Well, I'm going to turn on my iPod. We'll see if we get some music. I need a microphone. Hello? It's on, good deal. So, let's play something. [Music plays.] Now this is really coming from a yogurt cup and it's kind of a neat deal. Might not be your choice of music. Now you can experiment with different things. In fact, I did. Last night I did this. Let me walk over here. I made all these different speakers out of different things. Here's one. Because I'm in New York, I made one out of a piece of matzo. I made one out of a coffee cup lid. I made one out of a Tostito. The Tostito looks like a speaker, doesn't it? So, you can imagine how good that works. And then last night during rehearsals they gave us some food, and they gave us these thick potato chips. You've got to hear this, you guys. This is just incredible how nice that sounds. [Music plays.] It's just incredible. So anyway, like I said, today is the very best time, this age is the very best time to be a maker. You can make so many things if you put your mind to it. Get out there, pick something up because, I'll tell you, the stuff you make, the stuff you make is way better than the stuff you buy. It's special, it's significant to you, and I really encourage you to do that. Thanks a lot for listening to me.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you to one of the most amazing scientists who have ever lived. So famous, that more places on Earth have been named after him than any human being. So famous, that President Thomas Jefferson said he was the most important scientist he ever met. And Simon Bolivar called him the true discoverer of South America. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, every story on the front page of The New York Times was written about him. Who is this scientist and what did he do that was so extraordinary? His name is Alexander Von Humboldt. Never heard of him? Most people haven't. His name has been lost in history, but here is what he did. Alexander Von Humboldt started as a practicing geologist, but when an inheritance allowed him the freedom to travel, he began an incredible, five-year scientific journey through South America, Mexico, and Cuba. From 1799 to 1804, Von Humboldt and his botonist partner, Aime Bonpland, traveled through the jungles of Venezuela, made detailed drawings of Inca ruins while exploring the mountains of Peru, and traversed the breadth of Mexico and Cuba. He explored the length of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. This 1700 mile portion of the trip was filled with danger, disease, and fantastic new discoveries. For example, Von Humboldt was the first explorer to witness the preparation of the curare plant for poison arrows. He recognized the importance of the cinchona tree, whose bark contains quinine, which is a malaria cure, and discovered the ocean current, which limits rainfall on the coast of Peru, later named the Humboldt Current. He discovered and described many new species of plants and animals, including the electric eel. In Ecuador, he climbed the one of the highest volcanoes, Chimborazo, so that he could record air pressure, something no one had ever done at this altitude. The entire journey covered over 24,000 miles, the same distance as the circumference of the Earth. Along the way, he took measurements about the shape of the land, its temperature, the air pressure, and the strength of magnetic fields. By connecting places of identical temperatures, he created contour maps with lines of similar temperatures, which he called "isotherms". Because Humboldt invented these maps, scientists began to see patterns in the life and the types of life present in certain places, and he became a pioneer in the visual presentation of scientific data. These discoveries and measurements were critical to what made him such an important scientist. Until Humboldt, scientists who described new plants and animals did not clearly see the crucial connection between living things and the places in which they lived, called habitats. They did not appreciate the role of the environment on the diversity of life. Humboldt discovered and understood the importance of these connections. Because of this, he is considered the founder of biogeography. He also developed a theory called the "Unity of Nature," which shows the interconnectedness of all nature. This knowledge plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of our habitat. His book, Cosmos, describes this theory and is still in print today. As celebrated a scientist as he was, Von Humboldt was also generous, thus serving another role in the world. He was the mentor and teacher to younger scientists. In fact, just recently it was discovered the crucial role that Humboldt played in the work of his most famous pen-pal, Charles Darwin. A young Darwin read Humboldt extensively and wrote in his diary while on the Beagle, "I am at present fit only to read Humboldt. He, like another sun, illuminates everything I behold." Today, although Humboldt is known and revered by a small community of scientists, he is almost totally forgotten by many of us. Alexander Von Humboldt's influence is apparent everywhere and in every scientific discipline. He is, perhaps, the most important forgotten man of science. But he doesn't have to be, because if you remember him, perhaps his influence will be celebrated.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar I would like to introduce you to one of the most amazing scientists who have ever lived. So famous, that more places on Earth have been named after him than any human being. So famous, that President Thomas Jefferson said he was the most important scientist he ever met. And Simon Bolivar called him the true discoverer of South America. On the 100th anniversary of his birth, every story on the front page of The New York Times was written about him. Who is this scientist and what did he do that was so extraordinary? His name is Alexander Von Humboldt. Never heard of him? Most people haven't. His name has been lost in history, but here is what he did. Alexander Von Humboldt started as a practicing geologist, but when an inheritance allowed him the freedom to travel, he began an incredible, five-year scientific journey through South America, Mexico, and Cuba. From 1799 to 1804, Von Humboldt and his botonist partner, Aime Bonpland, traveled through the jungles of Venezuela, made detailed drawings of Inca ruins while exploring the mountains of Peru, and traversed the breadth of Mexico and Cuba. He explored the length of the Orinoco River in Venezuela. This 1700 mile portion of the trip was filled with danger, disease, and fantastic new discoveries. For example, Von Humboldt was the first explorer to witness the preparation of the curare plant for poison arrows. He recognized the importance of the cinchona tree, whose bark contains quinine, which is a malaria cure, and discovered the ocean current, which limits rainfall on the coast of Peru, later named the Humboldt Current. He discovered and described many new species of plants and animals, including the electric eel. In Ecuador, he climbed the one of the highest volcanoes, Chimborazo, so that he could record air pressure, something no one had ever done at this altitude. The entire journey covered over 24,000 miles, the same distance as the circumference of the Earth. Along the way, he took measurements about the shape of the land, its temperature, the air pressure, and the strength of magnetic fields. By connecting places of identical temperatures, he created contour maps with lines of similar temperatures, which he called "isotherms". Because Humboldt invented these maps, scientists began to see patterns in the life and the types of life present in certain places, and he became a pioneer in the visual presentation of scientific data. These discoveries and measurements were critical to what made him such an important scientist. Until Humboldt, scientists who described new plants and animals did not clearly see the crucial connection between living things and the places in which they lived, called habitats. They did not appreciate the role of the environment on the diversity of life. Humboldt discovered and understood the importance of these connections. Because of this, he is considered the founder of biogeography. He also developed a theory called the "Unity of Nature," which shows the interconnectedness of all nature. This knowledge plays a vital role in the preservation and protection of our habitat. His book, Cosmos, describes this theory and is still in print today. As celebrated a scientist as he was, Von Humboldt was also generous, thus serving another role in the world. He was the mentor and teacher to younger scientists. In fact, just recently it was discovered the crucial role that Humboldt played in the work of his most famous pen-pal, Charles Darwin. A young Darwin read Humboldt extensively and wrote in his diary while on the Beagle, "I am at present fit only to read Humboldt. He, like another sun, illuminates everything I behold." Today, although Humboldt is known and revered by a small community of scientists, he is almost totally forgotten by many of us. Alexander Von Humboldt's influence is apparent everywhere and in every scientific discipline. He is, perhaps, the most important forgotten man of science. But he doesn't have to be, because if you remember him, perhaps his influence will be celebrated.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So we live in what I think of as a CSI age where we take for granted that scientists are going to work together with the police, help them solve crimes, map fingerprints, analyze poisons, but in fact, this is really a very new idea. We only actually started training scientists and forensics in this country in the 1930s. So as a writer interested in chemistry, what I wondered was, "What was it like before scientists knew how to tease a poison out of a corpse, before you could actually catch a killer that way?" And it won't surprise you to learn that the answer is pretty dangerous. And in fact, in 1918, New York City issued a report admitting that smart poisoners could operate with impunity in the city. This is a 1918 crime scene photo from Brooklyn, and at this time, the coroner system was so corrupt that you could literally buy your cause of death. Often coroners didn't even show up at crime scenes. And if you go back and you look at the death certificates of the time, I found one that read, "Could be an auto accident or possibly diabetes." And another, which involved a man who shot himself in the head, said, "ruptured aneurysm". So you find, not surprisingly, the police saying, "We're going to look a lot smarter if we stay away from the science side of the story." But, in 1918 New York City appointed the first trained medical examiner it ever had. That's the gentleman sitting down there. And he hired the first forensic toxicologist ever attached to an American city. And together, these two men, Charles Norris, the medical examiner, and Alexander Gettler, the chemist sitting next to him, rewrote the rules of crime detection in this country. And that wasn't easy because poisons were everywhere. If we take this one, arsenic trioxide, arsenic trioxide's probably the most famous homicidal poison in history and it was in every home. Anyone could go to the grocery store or the pharmacy and buy it. It was in every kitchen because, believe it or not, it was used to color food. It was in medicines and it was in cosmetics in ways that prevented people from really understanding how dangerous these poisons were or how they worked. Now, scientists had in the 19th century begun developing tests to look for poisons in corpses. But as this cartoon shows you of the first test for arsenic, these were very primitive tests, so, that our heroes really have to figure this out as they go in the 1920s. Gettler, for instance, was the first person in the world to know how to tell if someone was drunk at time of death. He figured that out right about 1930 and he said later it took him 6,000 brains from the morgue to get to the point that he could get to that answer. And to give you a sense of what this is like, I'm going to ask you for a moment to become 1920s forensic detectives. This is a case based on one solved by Alexander Gettler in 1923, and as you can probably tell, it's a case that begins in a tenement building. This particular one was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. And these buildings were very crowded with families who had very little money. And the rooms were very poor. This is actually an abandoned room at the Tenement House Museum that is in Lower Manhattan today. These rooms often had no electricity, they had no hot water, and people who lived this way depended on gas to fuel everything from their stove to their electric lights. And this gas was called illuminating gas, and it was both a toxic and explosive mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. So you, the forensic scientist, are called to a crime scene in a tenement house. This is actually a police photo from the time in question, but the story that I'm going to tell you is a little more complicated than this. Nevertheless, you're going to go into this building, you're going to walk down this hall, you're going to go through the door, and you're going to find yourself in a very shabby apartment. The floors are splintered, the walls are peeling, there's only gas lighting, and in this case, you go into the back bedroom. There's clearly been a gas leak, there's a broken fitting on the wall. The police are opening the windows, and in the bed there's the body of young woman who's clearly been dead for some time because she's cold and she's stiff and she's pale. And you turn to the police and you say, "No, this is not an illuminating gas death because...." Because if you're killed by carbon monoxide, there is such a powerful chemical reaction in your blood as the oxygen is muscled out of the blood stream that the blood cells are turned a bright, cherry red. And this red is so strong that it flushes the skin of the corpse a cherry pink. In fact, people who see bodies after someone has died of a carbon monoxide death, they'll often talk about how healthy they look. So your poor, pale corpse could not have been killed by this gas. You take the body back to the morgue, you run more blood tests, and you find another gas at extremely high levels, carbon dioxide. And what does that tell you? If you think about the way we breath, we inhale oxygen, we exhale carbon dioxide, but what if you can't exhale? What if that gas can't get out? It backs up into your lungs, and the number one clue of a suffocation or a strangulation is elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. And in fact, what they found when they took a closer look at the body were the bruise marks left by her husband's fingers as he had held her down and suffocated her. And it turned out that he had taken out an insurance policy on her life, suffocated her, broken the gas fitting to try to stage an accident scene, and it turned out that it was chemistry that sent him to prison. There are so many good poison and murder stories from this time period that I would love to tell you. It's one of my favorite subjects obviously. But I want to leave you with this thought. Two things. One is that case that I just described to you is one of my favorites because it's the beginning of a series of investigations that persuade the New York police that they do need to work with scientists and it lays the foundation for, in fact, our CSI-era age, and, because it's such a good story of two very determined people, in this case two city scientists, who were able to change the world around them. Thank you.

The police are opening the windows, and in the bed there's the body of young woman who's clearly been dead for some time because she's cold and she's stiff and she's pale. And you turn to the police and you say, "No, this is not an illuminating gas death because...." Because if you're killed by carbon monoxide, there is such a powerful chemical reaction in your blood as the oxygen is muscled out of the blood stream that the blood cells are turned a bright, cherry red. And this red is so strong that it flushes the skin of the corpse a cherry pink. In fact, people who see bodies after someone has died of a carbon monoxide death, they'll often talk about how healthy they look. So your poor, pale corpse could not have been killed by this gas. You take the body back to the morgue, you run more blood tests, and you find another gas at extremely high levels, carbon dioxide. And what does that tell you? If you think about the way we breath, we inhale oxygen, we exhale carbon dioxide, but what if you can't exhale? What if that gas can't get out? It backs up into your lungs, and the number one clue of a suffocation or a strangulation is elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. And in fact, what they found when they took a closer look at the body were the bruise marks left by her husband's fingers as he had held her down and suffocated her. And it turned out that he had taken out an insurance policy on her life, suffocated her, broken the gas fitting to try to stage an accident scene, and it turned out that it was chemistry that sent him to prison. There are so many good poison and murder stories from this time period that I would love to tell you. It's one of my favorite subjects obviously. But I want to leave you with this thought. Two things. One is that case that I just described to you is one of my favorites because it's the beginning of a series of investigations that persuade the New York police that they do need to work with scientists and it lays the foundation for, in fact, our CSI-era age, and, because it's such a good story of two very determined people, in this case two city scientists, who were able to change the world around them. Thank you.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar So we live in what I think of as a CSI age where we take for granted that scientists are going to work together with the police, help them solve crimes, map fingerprints, analyze poisons, but in fact, this is really a very new idea. We only actually started training scientists and forensics in this country in the 1930s. So as a writer interested in chemistry, what I wondered was, "What was it like before scientists knew how to tease a poison out of a corpse, before you could actually catch a killer that way?" And it won't surprise you to learn that the answer is pretty dangerous. And in fact, in 1918, New York City issued a report admitting that smart poisoners could operate with impunity in the city. This is a 1918 crime scene photo from Brooklyn, and at this time, the coroner system was so corrupt that you could literally buy your cause of death. Often coroners didn't even show up at crime scenes. And if you go back and you look at the death certificates of the time, I found one that read, "Could be an auto accident or possibly diabetes." And another, which involved a man who shot himself in the head, said, "ruptured aneurysm". So you find, not surprisingly, the police saying, "We're going to look a lot smarter if we stay away from the science side of the story." But, in 1918 New York City appointed the first trained medical examiner it ever had. That's the gentleman sitting down there. And he hired the first forensic toxicologist ever attached to an American city. And together, these two men, Charles Norris, the medical examiner, and Alexander Gettler, the chemist sitting next to him, rewrote the rules of crime detection in this country. And that wasn't easy because poisons were everywhere. If we take this one, arsenic trioxide, arsenic trioxide's probably the most famous homicidal poison in history and it was in every home. Anyone could go to the grocery store or the pharmacy and buy it. It was in every kitchen because, believe it or not, it was used to color food. It was in medicines and it was in cosmetics in ways that prevented people from really understanding how dangerous these poisons were or how they worked. Now, scientists had in the 19th century begun developing tests to look for poisons in corpses. But as this cartoon shows you of the first test for arsenic, these were very primitive tests, so, that our heroes really have to figure this out as they go in the 1920s. Gettler, for instance, was the first person in the world to know how to tell if someone was drunk at time of death. He figured that out right about 1930 and he said later it took him 6,000 brains from the morgue to get to the point that he could get to that answer. And to give you a sense of what this is like, I'm going to ask you for a moment to become 1920s forensic detectives. This is a case based on one solved by Alexander Gettler in 1923, and as you can probably tell, it's a case that begins in a tenement building. This particular one was on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. And these buildings were very crowded with families who had very little money. And the rooms were very poor. This is actually an abandoned room at the Tenement House Museum that is in Lower Manhattan today. These rooms often had no electricity, they had no hot water, and people who lived this way depended on gas to fuel everything from their stove to their electric lights. And this gas was called illuminating gas, and it was both a toxic and explosive mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. So you, the forensic scientist, are called to a crime scene in a tenement house. This is actually a police photo from the time in question, but the story that I'm going to tell you is a little more complicated than this. Nevertheless, you're going to go into this building, you're going to walk down this hall, you're going to go through the door, and you're going to find yourself in a very shabby apartment. The floors are splintered, the walls are peeling, there's only gas lighting, and in this case, you go into the back bedroom. There's clearly been a gas leak, there's a broken fitting on the wall. The police are opening the windows, and in the bed there's the body of young woman who's clearly been dead for some time because she's cold and she's stiff and she's pale. And you turn to the police and you say, "No, this is not an illuminating gas death because...." Because if you're killed by carbon monoxide, there is such a powerful chemical reaction in your blood as the oxygen is muscled out of the blood stream that the blood cells are turned a bright, cherry red.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] i'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living and i'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free um but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children's hospital up at stanford in palo alto and it's from the experience of about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease now most of the time you think of pain is a symptom of a disease and that's true most of the time it's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation but about 10 of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for months and often times for years and when that happens it is its own disease and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients so imagine if you will then i'm stroking your arm with this feather as i'm stroking my arm right now now i want you to imagine that i'm stroking it with this please keep your seat a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain imagine if you will these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you were feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child's arm with this feather and their brain were telling them that they were feeling this hot torch that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph as you can see she's a beautiful young woman she was 16 years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that's the end of the story but in chandler's case that was the beginning of the story this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color it was categorically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hard wired like your house in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off the light goes off so people imagine the nervous system is just like that if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information up to the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simply where one nerve communicates with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your wall so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off that's crazy but that's in fact what happens with chronic pain and that's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler's we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with symptom modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life and we support all of that with a intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain it's successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doing a backflip and i had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at long beach here and she's doing absolutely fantastic but the future is actually even brighter the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain so that i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain thank you very much [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] i'm a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist so i put children to sleep for a living and i'm an academic so i put audiences to sleep for free um but what i actually mostly do is i manage the pain management service at the packard children's hospital up at stanford in palo alto and it's from the experience of about 20 or 25 years of doing that that i want to bring to you the message this morning that pain is a disease now most of the time you think of pain is a symptom of a disease and that's true most of the time it's the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation but about 10 of the time after the patient has recovered from one of those events pain persists it persists for months and often times for years and when that happens it is its own disease and before i tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it i want to show you how it feels for my patients so imagine if you will then i'm stroking your arm with this feather as i'm stroking my arm right now now i want you to imagine that i'm stroking it with this please keep your seat a very different feeling now what does it have to do with chronic pain imagine if you will these two ideas together imagine what your life would be like if i were to stroke it with this feather but your brain was telling you that this is what you were feeling and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain in fact imagine something even worse imagine i were to stroke your child's arm with this feather and their brain were telling them that they were feeling this hot torch that was the experience of my patient chandler whom you see in the photograph as you can see she's a beautiful young woman she was 16 years old last year when i met her and she aspired to be a professional dancer and during the course of one of her dance rehearsals she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist now you would probably imagine as she did that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person's life wrap it in an ace bandage take some ibuprofen for a week or two and that's the end of the story but in chandler's case that was the beginning of the story this is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain you can see that the arm is discolored purplish in color it was categorically cold to the touch the muscles were frozen paralyzed dystonic is how we refer to that the pain had spread from her wrist to her hands to her fingertips from her wrist up to her elbow almost all the way to her shoulder but the worst part was not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day the worst part was that she had allodynia the medical term for the phenomenon that i just illustrated with the feather and with the torch the lightest touch of her arm the touch of a hand the touch even of a sleeve of a garment as she put it on caused excruciating burning pain how can the nervous system get this so wrong how can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hard wired like your house in your house wires run in the wall from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb and when you turn the switch on the light goes on and when you turn the switch off the light goes off so people imagine the nervous system is just like that if you hit your thumb with a hammer these wires in your arm that of course we call nerves transmit the information up to the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires new nerves take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt but the situation of course in the human body is far more complicated than that instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simply where one nerve communicates with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion in fact what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions laterally vertically up and down in the spinal cord and they start interacting with other adjacent cells these cells called glial cells were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together like the nerves but it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation amplification and in the case of pain the distortion of sensory experiences these glial cells become activated their dna starts to synthesize new proteins which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves and they start releasing their neurotransmitters and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells and so on and so forth until what we have is a positive feedback loop it's almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your wall so that the next time you turned on the light switch the toilet flushed three doors down or your dishwasher went on or your computer monitor turned off that's crazy but that's in fact what happens with chronic pain and that's why pain becomes its own disease the nervous system has plasticity it changes and it morphs in response to stimuli well what do we do about that what can we do in a case like chandler's we treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time we treat them with symptom modifying drugs painkillers which are frankly not very effective for this kind of pain we take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics and most importantly what we do is we use a rigorous and often uncomfortable process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life and we support all of that with a intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency despair and depression that always accompanies severe chronic pain it's successful as you can see from this video of chandler who two months after we first met her is now doing a backflip and i had lunch with her yesterday because she's a college student studying dance at long beach here and she's doing absolutely fantastic but the future is actually even brighter the future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom modifying drugs that simply mask the problem as we have now but that will be disease modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind up or plasticity that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain so that i have hope that in the future the prophetic words of george carlin will be realized who said my philosophy no pain no pain thank you very much [Music] [Applause] you

**Transcript**:
hello my name is Thomas heatherwick um I'm uh I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings uh when I was growing up I was exposed to making and craft and materials and invention on a small scale and I was there looking at the largest scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in all the uh in the Publications that I was seeing was was felt soulless and cold and there on the smallest scale at the scale of an earring or a uh ceramic or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness and this uh influenced me the first building I built was 20 years ago and since in the last 20 years I've developed a studio in London and sorry this was my mother by the way in her shop bead shop in London I I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that I'm just going to show for people who don't know my Studio's work a few projects that we've worked on this is a hospital building thing this is a shop for a bag company this is uh Studios for artists this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball and this is a window display and this is a pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St Paul's Cathedral in London and this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk and this is a cafe by the sea in Britain and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the uh passenger their freedom again because uh the original rout Master bus that some of you made be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact I think all our root Masters are here in California now actually but they aren't in London um and so you're you're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to um uh stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop you're just a prisoner but the the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform uh so we've been working uh with Transport for London and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as as a client for a new bus for 50 years and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work the brief is that the bus should use 40% less energy so it's it's got hybrid drive and we've been working to try to improve working from everything from the fabric to the uh format and and uh structure and Aesthetics I was going to show four main projects and this is a a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open and opening seemed I mean everyone loves opening Bridges but it's quite a a kind of basic thing I mean I think we all stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed it I don't know if this is I'm slightly squeamish but the um you I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee and it had broken like this and um the and and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling but that there was a beautiful thing that had broken and so this is in Paddington in London and it's a very boring Bridge as you can see it's it's just steel and Timber and but instead of what it is our Focus was on the way the way it worked so we like the idea that the two furthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to half its speed cuz everyone was too scared when we first did it so that to speed it up a project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our future power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power um but recently any uh annual report of a power company has doesn't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that um and uh so we were when we were when the Consortium of Engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not going to just kind of decorate in a normal Power Station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on that just taking a field and bunging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just litter create one composition and what we found was I mean this this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain it was voted the worst place in Britain to live and there are 2,000 new homes being built bu next to this power station so it felt this has a a social Dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something that we are necessarily ashamed of so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to get my 250 foot high um and so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power Park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and a cost effective way of making a structure to do this so the the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a b Mitzvah at the top um and uh it's but it's it's a it's a power Park so people can come and really experience this and also look out uh all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in uh Shanghai we were invited to build uh the well we weren't invited what am I talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there um uh so to to so we won the competition to build the UK Pavilion and an expo is is a totally Bonkers thing uh there's 250 Pavilion um it the world's biggest ever Expo that had ever happened so there are up to a million people there every day and 250 countries all competing and the British government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became our uh the the the governmental goal is how do you stand out in this chaos of which is an expo um Vis of stimulus so we our sense was that we had to do one thing and and that only one thing instead of trying to have everything so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a Cheesy advert for Britain um but the the thing that was true the Expo is about the future of cities and uh particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into cities and the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain and the world's first major Botanical institution was is in London and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25% of all the world's plant species so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and I've never met anyone who says I don't like trees and the the same with flowers I've never met anyone who says I don't like flowers but that we realize that seeds there's this been this very serious project happening and but seeds these major botanical gardens there seeds aren't on show and you just have you have to go to garden center and they're in little paper packets but this this phenomenal Project's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds some kind of seed cedral but how could we show these teeny weeny things and the the film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts um so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we're trying to think how could we make a whole a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other Western Nations so that was also in the mix with a site the size of a football pitch and so there there was one particular toy that gave us a clue play top hair shop tops Play Tops the chair hair okay you get the idea so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious Optical hair and and grow that through through this box very simple box element uh and make a building that could move in the wind so the whole thing gently can move when the wind blows and inside the daylight it's each one is an optic and brings light into the center um and By Night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a big building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that so the the rest of the site was a public space and with that million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space the and we worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a a mini me version of the of the seed Cathedral so that even if you're partially cited that it was kind of crunchy Flo and soft that piece of landscape that you see there and then you know when you go uh when people when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur they in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we've shaved it and inside there's there's nothing there's no famous actor's voice there's no projections there's no televisions there's no color changing there's just silence and a cool temperature um and if you if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips that are letting the light through this is the only project that we've done where um the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact I mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possibly do at the Expo um and I just wanted to show you I mean the British government I mean any government is potentially the worst client in the world you ever possibly want to have and uh there was a lot of Terror and um but there was a kind of underlying support and that's uh and so there was a moment when suddenly and the actually the next thing this this is the head of UK trade and investment who was our clients um were with the Chinese children using the landscape go sorry I'm sorry about my stupid voice there um the uh so finally texture is something in the projects we've been working on uh the these kind of slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape but the materiality feels the same is something that we've been trying to um research really and explore Alternatives and the the project that we're building in uh Malaysia is uh apartment buildings for a property developer and it's in a piece of land that's this this site and the mayor of qual Lumpa said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in in this part of the world is that you you have your Tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked it's actually only the first couple of flaws that you really experience and the rest is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give a building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have 90% of the site as a rainforest instead of only 10% as scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings and so so we're we're building these these buildings they're they're actually identical so it's quite cost effective they're just chopped at different heights but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape rather than engulf it and that's my final slide thank you thank you so thank you thank you Thomas you're a delight since we have an extra minute here thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building um these are a few of the uh tests we did when we were building the structure so there were there were 66,000 of these this optic um was 22t long and so the daylight was just coming B was caught on the outside of the the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed and I mean waterproofing the building was a bit crazy CU normally it's quite hard to waterproof

**Transcript**:
hello my name is Thomas heatherwick um I'm uh I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings uh when I was growing up I was exposed to making and craft and materials and invention on a small scale and I was there looking at the largest scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in all the uh in the Publications that I was seeing was was felt soulless and cold and there on the smallest scale at the scale of an earring or a uh ceramic or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness and this uh influenced me the first building I built was 20 years ago and since in the last 20 years I've developed a studio in London and sorry this was my mother by the way in her shop bead shop in London I I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that I'm just going to show for people who don't know my Studio's work a few projects that we've worked on this is a hospital building thing this is a shop for a bag company this is uh Studios for artists this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball and this is a window display and this is a pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St Paul's Cathedral in London and this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk and this is a cafe by the sea in Britain and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the uh passenger their freedom again because uh the original rout Master bus that some of you made be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact I think all our root Masters are here in California now actually but they aren't in London um and so you're you're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to um uh stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop you're just a prisoner but the the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform uh so we've been working uh with Transport for London and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as as a client for a new bus for 50 years and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work the brief is that the bus should use 40% less energy so it's it's got hybrid drive and we've been working to try to improve working from everything from the fabric to the uh format and and uh structure and Aesthetics I was going to show four main projects and this is a a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open and opening seemed I mean everyone loves opening Bridges but it's quite a a kind of basic thing I mean I think we all stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed it I don't know if this is I'm slightly squeamish but the um you I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee and it had broken like this and um the and and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling but that there was a beautiful thing that had broken and so this is in Paddington in London and it's a very boring Bridge as you can see it's it's just steel and Timber and but instead of what it is our Focus was on the way the way it worked so we like the idea that the two furthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to half its speed cuz everyone was too scared when we first did it so that to speed it up a project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our future power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power um but recently any uh annual report of a power company has doesn't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that um and uh so we were when we were when the Consortium of Engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not going to just kind of decorate in a normal Power Station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on that just taking a field and bunging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just litter create one composition and what we found was I mean this this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain it was voted the worst place in Britain to live and there are 2,000 new homes being built bu next to this power station so it felt this has a a social Dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something that we are necessarily ashamed of so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to get my 250 foot high um and so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power Park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and a cost effective way of making a structure to do this so the the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a b Mitzvah at the top um and uh it's but it's it's a it's a power Park so people can come and really experience this and also look out uh all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in uh Shanghai we were invited to build uh the well we weren't invited what am I talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there um uh so to to so we won the competition to build the UK Pavilion and an expo is is a totally Bonkers thing uh there's 250 Pavilion um it the world's biggest ever Expo that had ever happened so there are up to a million people there every day and 250 countries all competing and the British government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became our uh the the the governmental goal is how do you stand out in this chaos of which is an expo um Vis of stimulus so we our sense was that we had to do one thing and and that only one thing instead of trying to have everything so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a Cheesy advert for Britain um but the the thing that was true the Expo is about the future of cities and uh particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into cities and the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain and the world's first major Botanical institution was is in London and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25% of all the world's plant species so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and I've never met anyone who says I don't like trees and the the same with flowers I've never met anyone who says I don't like flowers but that we realize that seeds there's this been this very serious project happening and but seeds these major botanical gardens there seeds aren't on show and you just have you have to go to garden center and they're in little paper packets but this this phenomenal Project's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds some kind of seed cedral but how could we show these teeny weeny things and the the film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts um so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we're trying to think how could we make a whole a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other Western Nations so that was also in the mix with a site the size of a football pitch and so there there was one particular toy that gave us a clue play top hair shop tops Play Tops the chair hair okay you get the idea so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious Optical hair and and grow that through through this box very simple box element uh and make a building that could move in the wind so the whole thing gently can move when the wind blows and inside the daylight it's each one is an optic and brings light into the center um and By Night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a big building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that so the the rest of the site was a public space and with that million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space the and we worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a a mini me version of the of the seed Cathedral so that even if you're partially cited that it was kind of crunchy Flo and soft that piece of landscape that you see there and then you know when you go uh when people when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur they in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we've shaved it and inside there's there's nothing there's no famous actor's voice there's no projections there's no televisions there's no color changing there's just silence and a cool temperature um and if you if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips that are letting the light through this is the only project that we've done where um the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact I mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possibly do at the Expo um and I just wanted to show you I mean the British government I mean any government is potentially the worst client in the world you ever possibly want to have and uh there was a lot of Terror and um but there was a kind of underlying support and that's uh and so there was a moment when suddenly and the actually the next thing this this is the head of UK trade and investment who was our clients um were with the Chinese children using the landscape go sorry I'm sorry about my stupid voice there um the uh so finally texture is something in the projects we've been working on uh the these kind of slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape but the materiality feels the same is something that we've been trying to um research really and explore Alternatives and the the project that we're building in uh Malaysia is uh apartment buildings for a property developer and it's in a piece of land that's this this site and the mayor of qual Lumpa said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in in this part of the world is that you you have your Tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked it's actually only the first couple of flaws that you really experience and the rest is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give a building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have 90% of the site as a rainforest instead of only 10% as scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings and so so we're we're building these these buildings they're they're actually identical so it's quite cost effective they're just chopped at different heights but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape rather than engulf it and that's my final slide thank you thank you so thank you thank you Thomas you're a delight since we have an extra minute here thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building um these are a few of the uh tests we did when we were building the structure so there were there were 66,000 of these this optic um was 22t long and so the daylight was just coming B was caught on the outside of the the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed and I mean waterproofing the building was a bit crazy CU normally it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it um it was quite a it was quite we had quite a time there was one person in the contractors who was the right size and it wasn't a child who could fit between them for for the final waterproofing of the building thank you Thomas

**Transcript**:
hello my name is Thomas heatherwick um I'm uh I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings uh when I was growing up I was exposed to making and craft and materials and invention on a small scale and I was there looking at the largest scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in all the uh in the Publications that I was seeing was was felt soulless and cold and there on the smallest scale at the scale of an earring or a uh ceramic or a musical instrument was a materiality and a soulfulness and this uh influenced me the first building I built was 20 years ago and since in the last 20 years I've developed a studio in London and sorry this was my mother by the way in her shop bead shop in London I I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that I'm just going to show for people who don't know my Studio's work a few projects that we've worked on this is a hospital building thing this is a shop for a bag company this is uh Studios for artists this is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball and this is a window display and this is a pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St Paul's Cathedral in London and this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk and this is a cafe by the sea in Britain and just very quickly something we've been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the uh passenger their freedom again because uh the original rout Master bus that some of you made be familiar with which had this open platform at the back in fact I think all our root Masters are here in California now actually but they aren't in London um and so you're you're stuck on a bus and if the bus is going to um uh stop and it's three yards away from the bus stop you're just a prisoner but the the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform uh so we've been working uh with Transport for London and that organization hasn't actually been responsible as as a client for a new bus for 50 years and so we've been very lucky to have a chance to work the brief is that the bus should use 40% less energy so it's it's got hybrid drive and we've been working to try to improve working from everything from the fabric to the uh format and and uh structure and Aesthetics I was going to show four main projects and this is a a project for a bridge and so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open and opening seemed I mean everyone loves opening Bridges but it's quite a a kind of basic thing I mean I think we all stand and watch but the the bridges that we saw that opened and closed it I don't know if this is I'm slightly squeamish but the um you I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball and as he was diving someone had stamped on his knee and it had broken like this and um the and and then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn't help feeling but that there was a beautiful thing that had broken and so this is in Paddington in London and it's a very boring Bridge as you can see it's it's just steel and Timber and but instead of what it is our Focus was on the way the way it worked so we like the idea that the two furthest bits of it would end up kissing each other we actually had to half its speed cuz everyone was too scared when we first did it so that to speed it up a project that we've been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station so a power station that uses organic waste material in the news the subject of where our future water is going to come from and where our future power is going to come from is in all the papers all the time and we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power um but recently any uh annual report of a power company has doesn't have a power station on it it has a child running through a field or something like that um and uh so we were when we were when the Consortium of Engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station our condition was that we would work with them and that whatever we did we were not going to just kind of decorate in a normal Power Station and instead we had to learn we kind of forced them to teach us and so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren't being capitalized on that just taking a field and bunging all these things out isn't necessarily the most efficient way that they could work so we looked at how we could compose all those elements instead of just litter create one composition and what we found was I mean this this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain it was voted the worst place in Britain to live and there are 2,000 new homes being built bu next to this power station so it felt this has a a social Dimension it has a symbolic importance and we should be proud of where our power is coming from rather than something that we are necessarily ashamed of so we were looking at how we could make a power station that instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside could be a place that pulls you in and it's a it has to be uh 8 I'm trying to get my 250 foot high um and so it felt that what we could try to do is make a power Park and actually bring the whole area in and using the spare soil that's there on the site we could make a power station that was silent as well because just that soil could make the acoustic difference and we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and a cost effective way of making a structure to do this so the the finished project is meant to be more than just a power station it has a space where you could have a b Mitzvah at the top um and uh it's but it's it's a it's a power Park so people can come and really experience this and also look out uh all around the area and use that height that we have to have for its function in uh Shanghai we were invited to build uh the well we weren't invited what am I talking about we won the competition and it was painful to get there um uh so to to so we won the competition to build the UK Pavilion and an expo is is a totally Bonkers thing uh there's 250 Pavilion um it the world's biggest ever Expo that had ever happened so there are up to a million people there every day and 250 countries all competing and the British government saying you need to be in the top five and so that that became our uh the the the governmental goal is how do you stand out in this chaos of which is an expo um Vis of stimulus so we our sense was that we had to do one thing and and that only one thing instead of trying to have everything so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn't do a Cheesy advert for Britain um but the the thing that was true the Expo is about the future of cities and uh particularly the victorians pioneered integrating nature into cities and the world's first public park of modern times was in Britain and the world's first major Botanical institution was is in London and they have this extraordinary project where they've been collecting 25% of all the world's plant species so we suddenly realized that there was this thing and everyone agrees that trees are beautiful and I've never met anyone who says I don't like trees and the the same with flowers I've never met anyone who says I don't like flowers but that we realize that seeds there's this been this very serious project happening and but seeds these major botanical gardens there seeds aren't on show and you just have you have to go to garden center and they're in little paper packets but this this phenomenal Project's been happening so we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds some kind of seed cedral but how could we show these teeny weeny things and the the film Jurassic Park actually really helped us because the the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the Amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious rather than looking like nuts um so the challenge was how are we going to bring light and expose these things we didn't want to make a separate building and have separate content so we're trying to think how could we make a whole a whole thing emanate by the way we had half the budget of the other Western Nations so that was also in the mix with a site the size of a football pitch and so there there was one particular toy that gave us a clue play top hair shop tops Play Tops the chair hair okay you get the idea so the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us and to take each seed and trap it in this precious Optical hair and and grow that through through this box very simple box element uh and make a building that could move in the wind so the whole thing gently can move when the wind blows and inside the daylight it's each one is an optic and brings light into the center um and By Night artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside and to make the project affordable we focused our energy instead of building a big building as big as the football pitch we focused it on this one element and the government agreed to do that and and not do anything else and focus our energy on that so the the rest of the site was a public space and with that million people there a day it just felt like offering some public space the and we worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a a mini me version of the of the seed Cathedral so that even if you're partially cited that it was kind of crunchy Flo and soft that piece of landscape that you see there and then you know when you go uh when people when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur they in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral in effect we've shaved it and inside there's there's nothing there's no famous actor's voice there's no projections there's no televisions there's no color changing there's just silence and a cool temperature um and if you if a if a cloud goes past you can see a cloud on the tips that are letting the light through this is the only project that we've done where um the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings a key thing was how people would interact I mean in a way it was the most serious thing you could possibly do at the Expo um and I just wanted to show you I mean the British government I mean any government is potentially the worst client in the world you ever possibly want to have and uh there was a lot of Terror and um but there was a kind of underlying support and that's uh and so there was a moment when suddenly and the actually the next thing this this is the head of UK trade and investment who was our clients um were with the Chinese children using the landscape go sorry I'm sorry about my stupid voice there um the uh so finally texture is something in the projects we've been working on uh the these kind of slick buildings where they might be a fancy shape but the materiality feels the same is something that we've been trying to um research really and explore Alternatives and the the project that we're building in uh Malaysia is uh apartment buildings for a property developer and it's in a piece of land that's this this site and the mayor of qual Lumpa said that if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city they would give them more gross floor area buildable so there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city and the conventional thing with apartment buildings in in this part of the world is that you you have your Tower and you squeeze a few trees around the edge and you see cars parked it's actually only the first couple of flaws that you really experience and the rest is just for postcards the lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this so if we could chop that away and give a building a small bottom we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer and by linking these together we could have 90% of the site as a rainforest instead of only 10% as scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings and so so we're we're building these these buildings they're they're actually identical so it's quite cost effective they're just chopped at different heights but the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape rather than engulf it and that's my final slide thank you thank you so thank you thank you Thomas you're a delight since we have an extra minute here thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building um these are a few of the uh tests we did when we were building the structure so there were there were 66,000 of these this optic um was 22t long and so the daylight was just coming B was caught on the outside of the the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed and I mean waterproofing the building was a bit crazy CU normally it's quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway but if you say you're going to drill 66,000 holes in it um it was quite a it was quite we had quite a time there was one person in the contractors who was the right size and it wasn't a child who could fit between them for for the final waterproofing of the building thank you Thomas

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry, a lesson of transformation. Step 1: Write it all down. "Take one memory, explore it like a new land," the visiting poet tells the class. "Don't leave anything out." Tyler sits in this high school workshop, dizzy with where to start. Memories wander in and out of his heart like vagrants searching for home. He bends to his desk, he writes, "The snow goes black when the moon turns its eyes away, all paper is yellow, all letters spell eviction note, Mama's lies are footsteps too many to count. Making excuses on black snow. 'I paid the rent, this is your room forever, baby. I love you.' But, she wouldn't even look at me." Step 2: Read out loud. As he writes, his lips try on words then toss them out like bad tenants. He pushes his desk back, stands. "Aunt Jocelyn's rice pudding was sweet, but that's not what I want to write. Have you ever been so cold your hair becomes an icicle? Your little sister's fear of the dark freezes on her lips like she's kissed the ice tray? How hungry have you been?" Step 3: Cut the fat. Abandon extra words. His pen becomes a machete, slashing ands, thens, becauses. Step 4: Read out loud, again. The 11th grade boy makes sure Step 3's cuts weren't too deep. Step 5: Add flava. Juice, power, movement, emotion. "Vanilla flavoring is the secret to my aunt's pudding. I kick out a few raisins but leave one or two. Life needs some bitter to man up the sweet." His hands reach out like shells to hold our disbelief. Is this Tyler speaking? The one who keeps his eyes on the floor like they're carrying something heavy? Voice rattles windows. "I am free now." Body quivers with the pulse of each word. "The sun's joy melts snow." Fingers trace the curve of his jaw. "My aunt's face was warm as a water heater when she let us in that night." Our boy is done, his transformation complete. Step 1: Write it all down. Step 2: Read out loud. Step 3: Cut the fat. Step 4: Read out loud. Step 5: Add flava.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry, a lesson of transformation. Step 1: Write it all down. "Take one memory, explore it like a new land," the visiting poet tells the class. "Don't leave anything out." Tyler sits in this high school workshop, dizzy with where to start. Memories wander in and out of his heart like vagrants searching for home. He bends to his desk, he writes, "The snow goes black when the moon turns its eyes away, all paper is yellow, all letters spell eviction note, Mama's lies are footsteps too many to count. Making excuses on black snow. 'I paid the rent, this is your room forever, baby. I love you.' But, she wouldn't even look at me." Step 2: Read out loud. As he writes, his lips try on words then toss them out like bad tenants. He pushes his desk back, stands. "Aunt Jocelyn's rice pudding was sweet, but that's not what I want to write. Have you ever been so cold your hair becomes an icicle? Your little sister's fear of the dark freezes on her lips like she's kissed the ice tray? How hungry have you been?" Step 3: Cut the fat. Abandon extra words. His pen becomes a machete, slashing ands, thens, becauses. Step 4: Read out loud, again. The 11th grade boy makes sure Step 3's cuts weren't too deep. Step 5: Add flava. Juice, power, movement, emotion. "Vanilla flavoring is the secret to my aunt's pudding. I kick out a few raisins but leave one or two. Life needs some bitter to man up the sweet."

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As any current or past
geometry student knows, the father of geometry was Euclid, a Greek mathematician who lived
in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 B.C.E. Euclid is known as the author
of a singularly influential work known as "Elements." You think your math book is long? Euclid's "Elements" is 13 volumes
full of just geometry. In "Elements," Euclid structured
and supplemented the work of many mathematicians
that came before him, such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus,
Hippocrates and others. Euclid laid it all out
as a logical system of proof built up from a set of definitions, common notions,
and his five famous postulates. Four of these postulates
are very simple and straightforward, two points determine a line, for example. The fifth one, however,
is the seed that grows our story. This fifth mysterious postulate
is known simply as the parallel postulate. You see, unlike the first four, the fifth postulate is worded
in a very convoluted way. Euclid's version states that, "If a line falls on two other lines so that the measure of the two interior
angles on the same side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then the lines eventually
intersect on that side, and therefore are not parallel." Wow, that is a mouthful! Here's the simpler, more familiar version: "In a plane, through any point
not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn
that's parallel to the original one." Many mathematicians over the centuries
tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four,
but weren't able to do so. In the process, they began looking at
what would happen logically if the fifth postulate
were actually not true. Some of the greatest minds in the history
of mathematics ask this question, people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri, János Bolyai, Carl Gauss,
and Nikolai Lobachevsky. They all experimented
with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise
to entire alternative geometries. These geometries became collectively known
as non-Euclidean geometries. We'll leave the details of these
different geometries for another lesson. The main difference depends
on the curvature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed. Turns out Euclid did not tell us
the entire story in "Elements," and merely described one possible way
to look at the universe. It all depends on the context
of what you're looking at. Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively
curved surfaces display very different characteristics. At first these alternative
geometries seemed strange, but were soon found to be equally adept
at describing the world around us. Navigating our planet
requires elliptical geometry while the much of the art of M.C. Escher
displays hyperbolic geometry. Albert Einstein used
non-Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space-time
becomes warped in the presence of matter, as part of his general
theory of relativity. The big mystery is whether
Euclid had any inkling of the existence
of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate. We may never know, but it's hard to believe he had
no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field
as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote
the postulate in such a way as to leave curious minds after him
to flush out the details. If so, he's probably pleased. These discoveries
could never have been made without gifted, progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside
of what they've been taught. We, too, must be willing at times
to put aside our preconceived notions and physical experiences and look at the larger picture, or we risk not seeing
the rest of the story.

no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field
as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote
the postulate in such a way as to leave curious minds after him
to flush out the details. If so, he's probably pleased. These discoveries
could never have been made without gifted, progressive thinkers able to suspend their preconceived notions and think outside
of what they've been taught. We, too, must be willing at times
to put aside our preconceived notions and physical experiences and look at the larger picture, or we risk not seeing
the rest of the story.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar As any current or past
geometry student knows, the father of geometry was Euclid, a Greek mathematician who lived
in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 B.C.E. Euclid is known as the author
of a singularly influential work known as "Elements." You think your math book is long? Euclid's "Elements" is 13 volumes
full of just geometry. In "Elements," Euclid structured
and supplemented the work of many mathematicians
that came before him, such as Pythagoras, Eudoxus,
Hippocrates and others. Euclid laid it all out
as a logical system of proof built up from a set of definitions, common notions,
and his five famous postulates. Four of these postulates
are very simple and straightforward, two points determine a line, for example. The fifth one, however,
is the seed that grows our story. This fifth mysterious postulate
is known simply as the parallel postulate. You see, unlike the first four, the fifth postulate is worded
in a very convoluted way. Euclid's version states that, "If a line falls on two other lines so that the measure of the two interior
angles on the same side of the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then the lines eventually
intersect on that side, and therefore are not parallel." Wow, that is a mouthful! Here's the simpler, more familiar version: "In a plane, through any point
not on a given line, only one new line can be drawn
that's parallel to the original one." Many mathematicians over the centuries
tried to prove the parallel postulate from the other four,
but weren't able to do so. In the process, they began looking at
what would happen logically if the fifth postulate
were actually not true. Some of the greatest minds in the history
of mathematics ask this question, people like Ibn al-Haytham, Omar Khayyam, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi, Giovanni Saccheri, János Bolyai, Carl Gauss,
and Nikolai Lobachevsky. They all experimented
with negating the parallel postulate, only to discover that this gave rise
to entire alternative geometries. These geometries became collectively known
as non-Euclidean geometries. We'll leave the details of these
different geometries for another lesson. The main difference depends
on the curvature of the surface upon which the lines are constructed. Turns out Euclid did not tell us
the entire story in "Elements," and merely described one possible way
to look at the universe. It all depends on the context
of what you're looking at. Flat surfaces behave one way, while positively and negatively
curved surfaces display very different characteristics. At first these alternative
geometries seemed strange, but were soon found to be equally adept
at describing the world around us. Navigating our planet
requires elliptical geometry while the much of the art of M.C. Escher
displays hyperbolic geometry. Albert Einstein used
non-Euclidean geometry as well to describe how space-time
becomes warped in the presence of matter, as part of his general
theory of relativity. The big mystery is whether
Euclid had any inkling of the existence
of these different geometries when he wrote his postulate. We may never know, but it's hard to believe he had
no idea whatsoever of their nature, being the great intellect that he was and understanding the field
as thoroughly as he did. Maybe he did know and he wrote

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Morton Bast I'm a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and my favorite hobby is photography. And as I travel around the world, I love taking photographs like these, so I can remember all
the beautiful and interesting things that I've seen. But what I can't do is record and share how these objects feel to touch. And that's kind of surprising, because your sense of touch
is really important. It's involved in every physical
interaction you do every day, every manipulation task,
anything you do in the world. So the sense of touch
is actually pretty interesting. It has two main components. The first is tactile sensations, things you feel in your skin. And the second is kinesthetic sensations. This has to do with the position
of your body and how it's moving, and the forces you encounter. And you're really good at incorporating both of these types of sensations together to understand the physical interactions
you have with the world and understand as you touch a surface: is it a rock, is it a cat,
is it a bunny, what is it? And so, as an engineer, I'm really fascinated and I have a lot of respect
for how good people are with their hands. And I'm intrigued and curious about whether we could
make technology better by doing a better job at leveraging the human capability
with the sense of touch. Could I improve the interfaces
to computers and machines by letting you take
advantage of your hands? And indeed, I think we can, and that's at the core
of a field called haptics, and this is the area that I work in. It's all about interactive
touch technology. And the way it works is, as you move your body through the world, if, as an engineer, I can make a system
that can measure that motion, and then present to you
sensations over time that kind of make sense, that match up with what you might feel
in the real world, I can fool you into thinking
you're touching something even though there's nothing there. So here are three examples and these are all done
from research in my lab at Penn. The first one is all about that same
problem that I was showing you: how can we capture how objects feel and recreate those experiences? So the way we solve this problem is by creating a hand-held tool that has many different sensors inside. It has a force sensor, so we can tell
how hard you're pushing; it has motion tracking, so we can tell
exactly where you've moved it; and it has a vibration sensor,
an accelerometer, inside, that detects the shaking
back and forth of the tool that lets you know
that's a piece of canvas and not a piece of silk or something else. Then we take the data we record
from these interactions. Here's ten seconds of data. You can see how the vibrations
get larger and smaller, depending on how you move. And we make a mathematical
model of those relationships and program them into a tablet computer so that when you take the stylus and go and touch the screen, that voice-coil actuator
in the white bracket plays vibrations to give you the illusion that you're touching the real surface, just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas. We can create very compelling illusions. We can do this for all kinds of surfaces
and it's really a lot of fun. We call it haptography --
haptic photography. And I think it has potential
benefits in all sorts of areas like online shopping,
maybe interactive museum exhibits, where you're not supposed
to touch the precious artifacts, but you always want to. The second example I want to tell you
about comes from a collaboration I have with Dr. Margrit Maggio
at the Penn Dental School. Part of her job is to teach
dental students how to tell where in a patient's mouth
there are cavities. Of course they look at X-rays, but a large part of this clinical judgment
comes from what they feel when they touch your teeth
with a dental explorer. You've all had this happen,
they go across. What they're feeling for is if the tooth
is really hard, then it's healthy, but if it's kind of soft and sticky, that's a signal that the enamel
is starting to decay. These types of judgments are hard
for a new dental student to make, because they haven't touched
a lot of teeth yet. And you want them to learn this
before they start practicing on real human patients. So what we do is add an accelerometer
on to the dental explorer, and then we record what Dr. Maggio feels as she touches different extracted teeth. And we can play it back for you as a video with a touch track -- not just a sound track,
but also a touch track, that you can feel by holding
that repeating tool. You feel the same things the dentist
felt when they did the recording, and practice making judgments. So here's a sample one. Here's a tooth that looks
kind of suspicious, right? It has all those brown stains. You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth." But if you pay attention to how it feels, all the surfaces of this tooth
are hard and healthy, so this patient does not need a filling. And these are exactly the kind
of judgments doctors make every day and I think this technology
we've invented has a lot of potential for many different things in medical
training, because it's really simple and it does a great job at recreating
what people feel through tools. I think it could also help make games
more interactive and fun and more realistic
in the sensations that you feel. The last example I want to tell you about
is again about human movement. So if any of you have ever learned sports, how do you get good
at something like surfing? You practice. You practice some more and more, right? Making small corrections,
maybe getting some input from a coach, learning how to improve your motions. I think we could use computers to help make that process
more efficient and more fun. And so here, for example,
if I have six different arm movements that I want you to learn, you come into my lab at Penn
and try out our system. We use a Kinect to measure your motions,
we show graphics on the screen, and then we also give you touch cues, haptic feedback on your arm, delivered by these haptic arm bands
which have motors inside, and guide you as you move. So, if we put it together, as you're trying to track this motion, if you deviate -- say, maybe,
your arm is a little too high -- we turn on the motors
right there on the skin to let you know you should move down, almost like a coach gently guiding you and helping you master
these movements more quickly and make more precise corrections. We developed this system
for use in stroke rehabilitation, but I think there are a lot
of applications, like maybe dance training
or all sorts of sports training as well. So now you know a little bit
about the field of haptics, which I think you'll hear more
about in the coming years. I've shown you three examples. I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the great students
who work with me in my lab at Penn and my collaborators. They're a great group. I also want to thank you
for your kind attention. (Applause)

felt when they did the recording, and practice making judgments. So here's a sample one. Here's a tooth that looks
kind of suspicious, right? It has all those brown stains. You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth." But if you pay attention to how it feels, all the surfaces of this tooth
are hard and healthy, so this patient does not need a filling. And these are exactly the kind
of judgments doctors make every day and I think this technology
we've invented has a lot of potential for many different things in medical
training, because it's really simple and it does a great job at recreating
what people feel through tools. I think it could also help make games
more interactive and fun and more realistic
in the sensations that you feel. The last example I want to tell you about
is again about human movement. So if any of you have ever learned sports, how do you get good
at something like surfing? You practice. You practice some more and more, right? Making small corrections,
maybe getting some input from a coach, learning how to improve your motions. I think we could use computers to help make that process
more efficient and more fun. And so here, for example,
if I have six different arm movements that I want you to learn, you come into my lab at Penn
and try out our system. We use a Kinect to measure your motions,
we show graphics on the screen, and then we also give you touch cues, haptic feedback on your arm, delivered by these haptic arm bands
which have motors inside, and guide you as you move. So, if we put it together, as you're trying to track this motion, if you deviate -- say, maybe,
your arm is a little too high -- we turn on the motors
right there on the skin to let you know you should move down, almost like a coach gently guiding you and helping you master
these movements more quickly and make more precise corrections. We developed this system
for use in stroke rehabilitation, but I think there are a lot
of applications, like maybe dance training
or all sorts of sports training as well. So now you know a little bit
about the field of haptics, which I think you'll hear more
about in the coming years. I've shown you three examples. I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the great students
who work with me in my lab at Penn and my collaborators. They're a great group. I also want to thank you
for your kind attention. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Morton Bast I'm a mechanical engineering professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and my favorite hobby is photography. And as I travel around the world, I love taking photographs like these, so I can remember all
the beautiful and interesting things that I've seen. But what I can't do is record and share how these objects feel to touch. And that's kind of surprising, because your sense of touch
is really important. It's involved in every physical
interaction you do every day, every manipulation task,
anything you do in the world. So the sense of touch
is actually pretty interesting. It has two main components. The first is tactile sensations, things you feel in your skin. And the second is kinesthetic sensations. This has to do with the position
of your body and how it's moving, and the forces you encounter. And you're really good at incorporating both of these types of sensations together to understand the physical interactions
you have with the world and understand as you touch a surface: is it a rock, is it a cat,
is it a bunny, what is it? And so, as an engineer, I'm really fascinated and I have a lot of respect
for how good people are with their hands. And I'm intrigued and curious about whether we could
make technology better by doing a better job at leveraging the human capability
with the sense of touch. Could I improve the interfaces
to computers and machines by letting you take
advantage of your hands? And indeed, I think we can, and that's at the core
of a field called haptics, and this is the area that I work in. It's all about interactive
touch technology. And the way it works is, as you move your body through the world, if, as an engineer, I can make a system
that can measure that motion, and then present to you
sensations over time that kind of make sense, that match up with what you might feel
in the real world, I can fool you into thinking
you're touching something even though there's nothing there. So here are three examples and these are all done
from research in my lab at Penn. The first one is all about that same
problem that I was showing you: how can we capture how objects feel and recreate those experiences? So the way we solve this problem is by creating a hand-held tool that has many different sensors inside. It has a force sensor, so we can tell
how hard you're pushing; it has motion tracking, so we can tell
exactly where you've moved it; and it has a vibration sensor,
an accelerometer, inside, that detects the shaking
back and forth of the tool that lets you know
that's a piece of canvas and not a piece of silk or something else. Then we take the data we record
from these interactions. Here's ten seconds of data. You can see how the vibrations
get larger and smaller, depending on how you move. And we make a mathematical
model of those relationships and program them into a tablet computer so that when you take the stylus and go and touch the screen, that voice-coil actuator
in the white bracket plays vibrations to give you the illusion that you're touching the real surface, just like if you touched, dragged
back and forth, on the real canvas. We can create very compelling illusions. We can do this for all kinds of surfaces
and it's really a lot of fun. We call it haptography --
haptic photography. And I think it has potential
benefits in all sorts of areas like online shopping,
maybe interactive museum exhibits, where you're not supposed
to touch the precious artifacts, but you always want to. The second example I want to tell you
about comes from a collaboration I have with Dr. Margrit Maggio
at the Penn Dental School. Part of her job is to teach
dental students how to tell where in a patient's mouth
there are cavities. Of course they look at X-rays, but a large part of this clinical judgment
comes from what they feel when they touch your teeth
with a dental explorer. You've all had this happen,
they go across. What they're feeling for is if the tooth
is really hard, then it's healthy, but if it's kind of soft and sticky, that's a signal that the enamel
is starting to decay. These types of judgments are hard
for a new dental student to make, because they haven't touched
a lot of teeth yet. And you want them to learn this
before they start practicing on real human patients. So what we do is add an accelerometer
on to the dental explorer, and then we record what Dr. Maggio feels as she touches different extracted teeth. And we can play it back for you as a video with a touch track -- not just a sound track,
but also a touch track, that you can feel by holding
that repeating tool. You feel the same things the dentist
felt when they did the recording, and practice making judgments. So here's a sample one. Here's a tooth that looks
kind of suspicious, right? It has all those brown stains. You might be thinking, "We should
definitely put a filling in this tooth." But if you pay attention to how it feels, all the surfaces of this tooth
are hard and healthy, so this patient does not need a filling. And these are exactly the kind
of judgments doctors make every day and I think this technology
we've invented has a lot of potential for many different things in medical

what people feel through tools. I think it could also help make games

**Transcript**:
[Music] how would you like to be better than you are suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self-confident how about living longer with good health or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one creativity how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good how many would opt for memory quite a few more how about Fitness few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject the great 20th century geneticist TG dodging ski who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life in this picture I've put a bush with a centre branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the Tree of Life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in we branched off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about 6 or 8 million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids some have come and gone we have been here for about a hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe 10 times more I mean think of it when Anthony Damacio asks about your self-image do you think about the bacteria our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it's war it's dark its moist it's very cozy and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it's really like an easy Street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended force rush to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four-and-a-half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so I hope you enjoyed it now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi-celled organisms come online things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction now I have to confess when I was a college undergraduate I thought okay sex death sex death death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing years I've come to have increasing doubts I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s and one night there's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl she looks at him and says I'm here for super sex that's fine says George I'll take the soup I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different I was trying to preserve the body I wanted to keep us healthy I wanted to restore health from disease I wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous-vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility I call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring there in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it's not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years it costs 2.7 billion dollars the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in 3 to 4 months today you can have a complete sequence of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week it won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the Lasker prize was awarded to the scientists Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a flurry potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible imagine then just two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm in the OVA or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old-style evolution into neo evolution will take a process that normally might require a hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us thank you [Applause]

come and gone we have been here for about a hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe 10 times more I mean think of it when Anthony Damacio asks about your self-image do you think about the bacteria our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it's war it's dark its moist it's very cozy and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it's really like an easy Street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended force rush to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four-and-a-half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so I hope you enjoyed it now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi-celled organisms come online things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction now I have to confess when I was a college undergraduate I thought okay sex death sex death death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing years I've come to have increasing doubts I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s and one night there's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl she looks at him and says I'm here for super sex that's fine says George I'll take the soup I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different I was trying to preserve the body I wanted to keep us healthy I wanted to restore health from disease I wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous-vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility I call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring there in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it's not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years it costs 2.7 billion dollars the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in 3 to 4 months today you can have a complete sequence of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week it won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the Lasker prize was awarded to the scientists Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a flurry potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible imagine then just two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm in the OVA or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old-style evolution into neo evolution will take a process that normally might require a hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us thank you [Applause]

[Music] how would you like to be better than you are suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self-confident how about living longer with good health or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one creativity how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good how many would opt for memory quite a few more how about Fitness few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject the great 20th century geneticist TG dodging ski who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is

healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the booster rockets designed to send the genetic payload into the next level of orbit and then drop off into the sea I think we would all understand the sentiment that Woody Allen expressed when he said I don't want to achieve immortality through my work I want to achieve it through not dying evolution does not necessarily favor the longest-lived it doesn't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest and not even the smartest evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment that is the sole test of survival and success at the bottom of the ocean bacteria that are thermophilic and can survive at the steam vent heat that would otherwise produce if fish were there sous-vide cooked fish nevertheless have managed to make that a hospitable environment for them so what does this mean as we look back at what has happened in evolution and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase I would say that there are a number of possibilities the first is that we will not evolve we have reached a kind of equipoise and the reasoning behind that would be first we have through medicine managed to preserve a lot of genes that would otherwise be selected out and be removed from the population and secondly we as a species have so configured our environment that we have managed to make it adapt to us as well as we adapt to it and by the way we immigrate and circulate and intermix so much that you can't any longer have the isolation that is necessary for evolution to take place a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind natural imposed by the forces of nature and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly but they are inexorable and as far as isolation goes when we as a species do colonize distant planets there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way but there's a third possibility an enticing intriguing and frightening possibility I call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make now how could this come about how could it be possible that we would do this consider first the reality that people today in some cultures are making choices about their offspring there in some cultures choosing to have more males than females it's not necessarily good for the society but it's what the individual and the family are choosing think also if it were possible ever for you not simply to choose the sex of your child but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke wouldn't you want to make those changes in your genes if we look ahead these kinds of changes are going to be increasingly possible the human genome project started in 1990 and it took 13 years it costs 2.7 billion dollars the year after it was finished in 2004 you could do the same job for 20 million dollars in 3 to 4 months today you can have a complete sequence of the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about $20,000 and in the space of about a week it won't be very long before the reality will be the $1,000 human genome and it will be increasingly available for everyone just a week ago the National Academy of Engineering awarded its Draper prize to francis arnold and willem stemmer two scientists who independently developed techniques to encourage the natural process of evolution to work faster and to lead to desirable proteins in a more efficient way what Francis Arnold calls directed evolution a couple of years ago the Lasker prize was awarded to the scientists Shinya Yamanaka for his research in which he took an adult skin cell a fibroblast and by manipulating just four genes he induced that cell to revert to a flurry potential stem cell a cell potentially capable of becoming any cell in your body these changes are coming the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves but induce immunity against other viruses believe it or not there's an experimental trial going on with vaccine against influenza that has been grown in the cells of a tobacco plant can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco these are all reality today and the future will be evermore possible imagine then just two other little changes you can change the cells in your body but what if you could change the cells in your offspring what if you could change the sperm in the OVA or change the newly fertilized egg and give your offspring a better chance at a healthier life eliminate the diabetes eliminate the hemophilia reduce the risk of cancer who doesn't want healthier children and then that same analytic technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease will also enable us to adopt super attributes hyper capacities that better memory why not have the quick wit of a Ken Jennings especially if you can augment it with the next generation of the Watson machine why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer why not live longer these will be irresistible and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we want we will have converted old-style evolution into neo evolution will take a process that normally might require a hundred thousand years and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next 100 years these are choices that your grandchildren or their grandchildren are going to have before them will we use these choices to make a society that is better that is more successful that is kinder or will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us will we make a society that is more boring and more uniform or more robust and more versatile these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face and most profoundly of all will we ever be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom that we'll need to make these choices wisely for better or worse and sooner than you may think these choices will be up to us thank you [Applause]

[Music] how would you like to be better than you are suppose I said that with just a few changes in your genes you could get a better memory more precise more accurate and quicker or maybe you'd like to be more fit stronger with more stamina would you like to be more attractive and self-confident how about living longer with good health or perhaps you're one of those who's always yearned for more creativity which one would you like the most which would you like if you could have just one creativity how many people would choose creativity raise your hands let me see a few probably about as many as there are creative people here that's very good how many would opt for memory quite a few more how about Fitness few less what about longevity ah the majority that makes me feel very good as a doctor if you could have any one of these it would be a very different world is it just imaginary or is it perhaps possible evolution has been a perennial topic here at the TED conference but I want to give you today one doctor's take on the subject the great 20th century geneticist TG dodging ski who was also a communicant in the Russian Orthodox Church once wrote an essay that he titled nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid take out your personal communications device I give you permission and perhaps take another look at Catherine Schultz's book on being wrong because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you but if you do accept biological evolution consider this is it just about the past or is it about the future does it apply to others or does it apply to us this is another look at the tree of life in this picture I've put a bush with a centre branching out in all directions because if you look at the edges of the Tree of Life every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment the human part of this branch way out on one end is of course the one that we are most interested in we branched off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about 6 or 8 million years ago in the interval there have been perhaps 20 or 25 different species of hominids some have come and gone we have been here for about a hundred and thirty thousand years it may seem like we're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life but actually for the most part the basic machinery of ourselves is pretty much the same do you realize that we can take advantage and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin used to treat diabetics this is not like human insulin this is the same protein that is chemically indistinguishable from what comes out of your pancreas and speaking of bacteria do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body maybe 10 times more I mean think of it when Anthony Damacio asks about your self-image do you think about the bacteria our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment for those bacteria it's war it's dark its moist it's very cozy and you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part it's really like an easy Street for bacteria with the occasional interruption of the unintended force rush to the exit but otherwise you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria just as they are essential to your life they help in the digestion of essential nutrients and they protect you against certain diseases but what will come in the future are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species or are we destined to become something different something perhaps even better adapted to the environment now let's take a step back in time to the Big Bang fourteen billion years ago the earth the solar system about four-and-a-half billion years the first signs of proto life maybe three to four billion years ago on earth the first multi-celled organisms perhaps as much as 800 or a billion years ago and then the human species finally emerging in the last hundred and thirty thousand years in this vast unfinished symphony of the universe life on Earth is like a brief measure the animal kingdom like a single single measure and human life a small grace note that was us that also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk so I hope you enjoyed it now when I was a freshman in college I took my first biology class I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology I became enamored of the power of evolution and I realized something very fundamental in most of the existence of life in single-celled organisms each cell simply divides and all of the genetic energy of that cell is carried on in both daughter cells but at the time multi-celled organisms come online things start to change sexual reproduction enters the picture and very importantly with the introduction of sexual reproduction that passes on the genome the rest of the body becomes expendable in fact you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction now I have to confess when I was a college undergraduate I thought okay sex death sex death death for sex seemed pretty reasonable at the time but with each passing years I've come to have increasing doubts I've come to understand the sentiments of George Burns who was performing still in Las Vegas well into his 90s and one night there's a knock at his hotel room door he answers the door standing before him is a gorgeous scantily clad showgirl she looks at him and says I'm here for super sex that's fine says George I'll take the soup I came to realize as a physician that I was working toward a goal which was different from the goal of evolution not necessarily contradictory just different I was trying to preserve the body I wanted to keep us healthy I wanted to restore health from disease I wanted us to live long and healthy lives evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation adapting and surviving through generation after generation from an evolutionary point of view you and I are like the

**Transcript**:
one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument which would think if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of Congress I have a suggestion look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same-sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens Aristotle's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so you ready for the lecture according to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that's that's it that's the lecture now you may say well that's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones let's see what people what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out at random you would do it by lottery or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them well the best flute players the worst flute players how many say the best flute players why why should the best flute actually that was Aristotle's answer to but here's a harder question why do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players who's the greatest benefit to all will hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players that's Peter alright well it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music has played rather than terrible music but Peter Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said that's what flutes are for to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or of the social activity in this case musical performance and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it will be a happy by-product that we'll all benefit but when we think about justice Aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case let's take a contemporary example of a dispute about justice had to do with golf Casey Martin a few years ago Casey Martin did any of you hear about him he is a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury he asked the PGA the Professional Golfers Association for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments they said no no that would give you an unfair advantage he sued and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court believe it or not the case over the golf cart because the law says the distance that the disabled must be accommodated provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity he says I'm a great golfer I want to compete but I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose you were on the Supreme Court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case how many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn't let's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of Casey Martin and how many would not how many would say he doesn't have all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart what would be your reason raise your hand and we'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart all right those of you I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worried about an unfair advantage what about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes all right what's your name Charley says well get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us Charley why why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart but what about walking from hole to hole it doesn't matter it's not part of the game walking the course is not part of the game of golf not in my opinion all right stay there Charley who has an answer who has an answer for chart by the way all right who has an answer for Charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game walking all those holes walking all those holes that's part of part of the game of golf absolutely what's your name Warren Warren Charlie what do you say to war I'll stick to my original thesis well we're on our you golf er I'm not a golfer and I am okay you know it's interesting in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with Warren they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting well by I should tell you how the Supreme Court refers the Supreme Court decided what are you suppose they said they said yes that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf and the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question and justice Stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf and the essential point of the game is to get a very small ball from one place into a hole and as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was Justice Scalia he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion he said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf here's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of the games arbitrary rules is essential so there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way if we thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game it's also objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness on what's an unfair advantage but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be let everyone write in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been I suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA even than making an exception for Casey Martin why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point that's delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in the golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that with golf as with flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what quality is what excellence is connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same-sex marriage there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only and how many favor the second same-sex marriage now put it this way what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about so with flutes with golf carts and even with a few sleek intested question like same-sex marriage aristotle has a point very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve elevate the terms of political discourse in the United States and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious

bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much okay okay okay so from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage that was genius Lee now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series is one of the first to do a big what's your vision for the next phase of this well I think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments and some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and I think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in China in India in Africa around the world to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate so you picture at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from China and India joining in right we did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach and we do it in the classroom at Harvard with about a thousand students wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in Beijing and in Mumbai and in Cambridge Massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what I would love to do so I would imagine I would imagine that there are a lot of people would love to join you on that endeavor Michael Sandel thank you so much

**Transcript**:
one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument which would think if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of Congress I have a suggestion look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same-sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens Aristotle's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so you ready for the lecture according to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that's that's it that's the lecture now you may say well that's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones let's see what people what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out at random you would do it by lottery or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them well the best flute players the worst flute players how many say the best flute players why why should the best flute actually that was Aristotle's answer to but here's a harder question why do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players who's the greatest benefit to all will hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players that's Peter alright well it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music has played rather than terrible music but Peter Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said that's what flutes are for to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or of the social activity in this case musical performance and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it will be a happy by-product that we'll all benefit but when we think about justice Aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case let's take a contemporary example of a dispute about justice had to do with golf Casey Martin a few years ago Casey Martin did any of you hear about him he is a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury he asked the PGA the Professional Golfers Association for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments they said no no that would give you an unfair advantage he sued and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court believe it or not the case over the golf cart because the law says the distance that the disabled must be accommodated provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity he says I'm a great golfer I want to compete but I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose you were on the Supreme Court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case how many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn't let's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of Casey Martin and how many would not how many would say he doesn't have all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart what would be your reason raise your hand and we'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart all right those of you I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worried about an unfair advantage what about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes all right what's your name Charley says well get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us Charley why why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart but what about walking from hole to hole it doesn't matter it's not part of the game walking the course is not part of the game of golf not in my opinion all right stay there Charley who has an answer who has an answer for chart by the way all right who has an answer for Charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game walking all those holes walking all those holes that's part of part of the game of golf absolutely what's your name Warren Warren Charlie what do you say to war I'll stick to my original thesis well we're on our you golf er I'm not a golfer and I am okay you know it's interesting in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with Warren they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting well by I should tell you how the Supreme Court refers the Supreme Court decided what are you suppose they said they said yes that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf and the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question and justice Stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf and the essential point of the game is to get a very small ball from one place into a hole and as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was Justice Scalia he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion he said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf here's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of the games arbitrary rules is essential so there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way if we thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game it's also objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness on what's an unfair advantage but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be let everyone write in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been I suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA even than making an exception for Casey Martin why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point that's delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in the golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that with golf as with flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what quality is what excellence is connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same-sex marriage there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only and how many favor the second same-sex marriage now put it this way what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about so with flutes with golf carts and even with a few sleek intested question like same-sex marriage aristotle has a point very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve elevate the terms of political discourse in the United States and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring the civic life it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much okay okay okay so from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage that was genius Lee now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series is one of the first to do a big what's your vision for the next phase of this well I think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments and some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have

education and also a richer kind of democratic debate so you picture at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from China and India

**Transcript**:
one thing the world needs one thing this country desperately needs is a better way of conducting our political debates we need to rediscover the lost art of democratic argument which would think if you think about the arguments we have most of the time it's shouting matches on cable television ideological food fights on the floor of Congress I have a suggestion look at all of the arguments we have these days over health care over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street over the gap between rich and poor over affirmative action and same-sex marriage lying just beneath the surface of those arguments with passions raging on all sides are big questions of moral philosophy big questions of justice but we too rarely articulate and defend and argue about those big moral questions in our politics so what I would like to do today is have something of a discussion first let me take a famous philosopher who wrote about those questions of justice and morality give you a very short lecture on Aristotle of ancient Athens Aristotle's theory of justice and then have a discussion here to see whether Aristotle's ideas actually inform the way we think and argue about questions today so you ready for the lecture according to Aristotle justice means giving people what they deserve that's that's it that's the lecture now you may say well that's obvious enough the real questions begin when it comes to arguing about who deserves what and why take the example of flutes suppose we're distributing flutes who should get the best ones let's see what people what would you say who should get the best flute you can just call it out at random you would do it by lottery or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them well the best flute players the worst flute players how many say the best flute players why why should the best flute actually that was Aristotle's answer to but here's a harder question why do you think those of you who voted this way that the best flutes should go to the best flute players who's the greatest benefit to all will hear better music if the best flutes should go to the best flute players that's Peter alright well it's a good reason we'll all be better off if good music has played rather than terrible music but Peter Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason that's all right Aristotle had a different reason for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players he said that's what flutes are for to be played well he says that to reason about just distribution of a thing we have to reason about and sometimes argue about the purpose of the thing or of the social activity in this case musical performance and the point the essential nature of musical performance is to produce excellent music it will be a happy by-product that we'll all benefit but when we think about justice Aristotle says what we really need to think about is the essential nature of the activity in question and the qualities that are worth honoring and admiring and recognizing one of the reasons that the best flute players should get the best flutes is that musical performance is not only to make the rest of us happy but to honor and recognize the excellence of the best musicians now flutes may seem the distribution of flutes may seem a trivial case let's take a contemporary example of a dispute about justice had to do with golf Casey Martin a few years ago Casey Martin did any of you hear about him he is a very good golfer but he had a disability he had a bad leg a circulatory problem that made it very painful for him to walk the course in fact it carried risk of injury he asked the PGA the Professional Golfers Association for permission to use a golf cart in the PGA tournaments they said no no that would give you an unfair advantage he sued and his case went all the way to the Supreme Court believe it or not the case over the golf cart because the law says the distance that the disabled must be accommodated provided the accommodation does not change the essential nature of the activity he says I'm a great golfer I want to compete but I need a golf cart to get from one hole to the next suppose you were on the Supreme Court suppose you were deciding the justice of this case how many here would say that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart and how many say no he doesn't let's take a poll show of hands how many would rule in favor of Casey Martin and how many would not how many would say he doesn't have all right we have a good division of opinion here someone who would not grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart what would be your reason raise your hand and we'll try to get you a microphone what would be your reason be an unfair advantage if he gets to ride in a golf cart all right those of you I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart worried about an unfair advantage what about those of you who say he should be given a golf cart how would you answer the objection yes all right what's your name Charley says well get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply tell us Charley why why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart but what about walking from hole to hole it doesn't matter it's not part of the game walking the course is not part of the game of golf not in my opinion all right stay there Charley who has an answer who has an answer for chart by the way all right who has an answer for Charlie what would you say the endurance element is a very important part of the game walking all those holes walking all those holes that's part of part of the game of golf absolutely what's your name Warren Warren Charlie what do you say to war I'll stick to my original thesis well we're on our you golf er I'm not a golfer and I am okay you know it's interesting in the case in the lower court they brought in golfing greats to testify on this very issue is walking the course essential to the game and they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer and what do you suppose they all said yes they agreed with Warren they said yes walking the course is strenuous physical exercise the fatigue factor is an important part of golf and so it would change the fundamental nature of the game to give him the golf cart now notice something interesting well by I should tell you how the Supreme Court refers the Supreme Court decided what are you suppose they said they said yes that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart seven to two they ruled what was interesting about their ruling and about the discussion we've just had is that the discussion about the right the justice of the matter depended on figuring out what is the essential nature of golf and the Supreme Court justices wrestled with that question and justice Stevens writing for the majority said he had read all about the history of golf and the essential point of the game is to get a very small ball from one place into a hole and as few strokes as possible and that walking was not essential but incidental now there were two dissenters one of whom was Justice Scalia he wouldn't have granted the cart and he had a very interesting dissent it's interesting because he rejected the Aristotelian premise underlying the majority's opinion he said it's not possible to determine the essential nature of a game like golf here's how he put it to say that something is essential is ordinarily to say that it is necessary to the achievement of a certain object but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement that is what distinguishes games from productive activity it is quite impossible to say that any of the games arbitrary rules is essential so there you have Justice Scalia taking on the Aristotelian premise of the majority's opinion Justice Scalia's opinion is questionable for two reasons first no real sports fan would talk that way if we thought that the rules of the sports we care about are merely arbitrary rather than designed to call forth the virtues and the excellences that we think are worthy of admiring we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game it's also objectionable on a second ground on the face of it it seemed to be this debate about the golf cart an argument about fairness on what's an unfair advantage but if fairness were the only thing at stake there would have been an easy and obvious solution what would it be let everyone write in a golf cart if they want to then the fairness objection goes away but letting everyone ride in a cart would have been I suspect more anathema to the golfing greats and to the PGA even than making an exception for Casey Martin why because what was at stake in the dispute over the golf cart was not only the essential nature of golf but relatedly the question what abilities are worthy of honor and recognition as athletic talents let me put the point that's delicately as possible golfers are a little sensitive about the athletic status of their game after all there's no running or jumping and the ball stands still so if golfing is the kind of game that can be played while riding around in the golf cart it would be hard to confer on the golfing greats the status that we confer the honor and recognition that goes to truly great athletes that illustrates that with golf as with flutes it's hard to decide the question of what justice requires without grappling with the question what is the essential nature of the activity in question and what quality is what excellence is connected with that activity are worthy of honor and recognition let's take a final example that's prominent in contemporary political debate same-sex marriage there are those who favor state recognition only of traditional marriage between one man and one woman and there are those who favor state recognition of same-sex marriage how many here favor the first policy the state should recognize traditional marriage only and how many favor the second same-sex marriage now put it this way what ways of thinking about justice and morality underlie the arguments we have over marriage the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage fundamentally is procreation and that's what's worthy of honoring and recognizing and encouraging and the defenders of same-sex marriage say no procreation is not the only purpose of marriage what about a lifelong mutual loving commitment that's really what marriage is about so with flutes with golf carts and even with a few sleek intested question like same-sex marriage aristotle has a point very hard to argue about justice without first arguing about the purpose of social institutions and about what qualities are worthy of honor and recognition so let's step back from these cases and see how they shed light on the way we might improve elevate the terms of political discourse in the United States and for that matter around the world there is a tendency to think that if we engage too directly with moral questions in politics that's a recipe for disagreement and for that matter a recipe for intolerance and coercion so better to shy away from to ignore the moral and the religious convictions that people bring the civic life it seems to me that our discussion reflects the opposite that a better way to mutual respect is to engage directly with the moral convictions citizens bring to public life rather than to require that people leave their deepest moral convictions outside politics before they enter that it seems to me is a way to begin to restore the art of democratic argument thank you very much okay okay okay so from flutes to golf courses to same-sex marriage that was genius Lee now look you're a pioneer of open education your lecture series is one of the first to do a big what's your vision for the next phase of this well I think that it is possible in the classroom we have arguments and some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions and I think we can do that in public life more generally and so my real dream would be to take the the public television series that we've created of the course it's available now online free for everyone anywhere in the world and to see whether we can partner with institutions at universities in China in India in Africa around the world to try to promote civic education and also a richer kind of democratic debate so you picture at some point live in real time you could have this kind of conversation inviting questions but with people from China and India joining in right we did a little bit of it here with 1,500 people in Long Beach and we do it in the classroom at Harvard with about a thousand students wouldn't it be interesting to take this way of thinking and arguing engaging seriously with big moral questions exploring cultural differences and connect through a live video hookup students in Beijing and in Mumbai and in Cambridge Massachusetts and create a global classroom that's what I would love to do so I would imagine I would imagine that there are a lot of people would love to join you on that endeavor Michael Sandel thank you so much thanks

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity

if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for

9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously believed that he had a Damon who spoke wisdom to him from afar the Romans had the same idea but they called that sort of disembodied creative Spirit a genius um which is great because the Romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual they believe that a genius was this sort of magical Divine entity um who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist studio kind of like Dobby the house elf um and who would come out and sort of invisibly assist the artists with their work and would shape the outcome of that work so brilliant there it is right there that distance that I'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work you know um and everyone knew that this is how it functioned right so the ancient artist was protected from certain things like for example too much narcissism right if your work was brilliant couldn't take all the credit for it everybody knew you had this like disembodied genius who had helped you if your work bombed not entirely your fault you know um everyone knew your Genius was kind of lame and uh this is how people thought about creativity in the West for a really long time and then the Renaissance came and everything changed and we had this big idea and the big idea was let's put the individual human being at the center of the universe right above all gods and Mysteries and there's no more room for like mystical creatures who take dictation from the Divine and and it's the beginning of rational humanism and um people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual and for the first time in history you start to hear people referring to this or that Artist as being a genius rather than having a genius and I got to tell you I think that was a huge error you know I I think that allowing somebody like one mere person to believe that he or she is like the vessel you know like the font and the essence and the source of all Divine creative unknowable Eternal mystery is just like a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile human psyche it's like asking somebody to swallow the sun you know it just completely warps and distorts Egos and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance and I think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years and um if this is true and I I think it is true the question becomes you know what now you know can we do this differently uh maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery um maybe not you know like um maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought in one 18-minute speech um and there's probably people in this audience who would raise like really legitimate scientific suspicions about the notion of basically fairies who follow people around like rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff like I I'm not probably going to bring you all along with me on this um but the the question that I kind of want to pose is you know why not um why not think about it this way because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness of the creative process a process which as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say as basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally and in fact can sometimes feel downright paranormal um I had this encounter recently where I met the extraordinary American poet Ruth Stone who's now in her 90s but she's been a poet her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia she would be out working in the fields and she said she would like feel and hear a poem coming at her from Over the landscape and she said it was like a thunderous train of air and it would come barreling down at her over the landscape and when she felt it coming because it would like shake the Earth under her feet she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point and that was to in her words run like hell and she would like run like hell to the house and she'd be getting chased by this poem and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pencil fast enough so that when it thundered through her she could collect it and um and grab it on the page and other times she wouldn't be fast enough so she'd be like running and running and running and the she wouldn't get to the house and the poem would like Barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape looking as she put it for another poet and um and then there were these times this is the piece I never forgot she said that there were moments when she would almost miss it right so she's like running into the house and she's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her and she grabs a pencil just as it's going through her and then she said it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it she would catch the poem by its tail and she would pull it backwards into her body as she was transcribing on the page and in these instances the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards from the last word to the first so when I heard that I was like that's un you know that's uncanny that's exactly what my creative process is like it's not at all what my creative process I'm not the pipeline you know like I'm a mule and the way that I have to work is that I have to get up at the same time every day and like sweat and labor and like Barrel through it really awkwardly but even I in my mulishness even I have brushed up against that thing you know at times um and I would imagine that a lot of you have too you know like even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I honestly cannot identify and what is that thing and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our mind mind but in fact might actually keep us sane and for me the best contemporary example that I have of how to do that um is the musician Tom weights who I got to interview um several years ago on a um on a magazine assignment and we were talking about this and you know you you know Tom I mean for most of his life he was pretty much the embodiment of the tormented contemporary modern artist you know like trying to control and manage and dominate these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses you know that were totally internalized but then he got older and he got calmer and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles he told me and this is when it all changed for him and um and he's like speeding along and all of a sudden he hears this little fragment of Melody you know that comes into his head as inspiration often comes Elusive and tantalizing and he wants it you know it's gorgeous and and he Longs for it but he has no way to get it he doesn't have a piece of paper he doesn't have a pencil he doesn't have a tape recorder so he starts to feel all that old anxiety start to rise in him like I'm going to lose this thing you know um and I'm going to be haunted by this song forever and I'm not good enough and I can't do it and instead of panicking he just stopped he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel um he just looked up at the sky and he said excuse me can you not see that I'm driving do I look like I can write down a song right now you know if you really want to exist come back at a more opportune moment when I can take care of you otherwise go bother somebody else today go bother Leonard Cohen you know and and his whole work process changed after that not the work the work was still like often times as dark as ever you know but the process and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble and released it kind of back where it came from and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized tormented thing it could be this peculiar wondrous bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between Tom and the strange external thing that was not quite Tom um so when I heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that I worked too and it already saved me once this idea it saved me when I was in the middle of writing Eat Pray Love and I fell into one of those sort of pits of Despair that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster this is going to be the worst book ever WR not just bad but the worst book ever written and um and I started to think I should just dump this project you know um but then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I I I tried it um so I just lifted my face up from the manuscript and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room and I I said aloud uh listen you thing um you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant that is not entirely my fault right because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this you know I don't have any more than this so if you want it to be better then you got to show up and do your part of the deal okay but if you don't do that you know what the hell with it I'm going to keep writing anyway because that's my job and I would please like the to reflect today that I showed up for my part of the job because thank you in the end it's like this okay centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa people used to gather for these Moonlight dances of sacred dance and music that would go on for hours and hours until dawn and they were always magnificent because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific right but every once in a while very rarely something would happen and one of these performers would actually become Transcendent and I know you know what I'm talking about because I know you've all seen at some point in your life a performance like this you know and it was like time would stop and the dancer would sort of Step through some kind of portal and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done you know a Thousand Nights before but everything would align and all of a sudden he would no longer appear to be merely human you know he would be like lit from within and lit from below and all like lit up on fire with divinity and when this happened back then people knew it for what it was you know they called it by its name they would put their hands together and they would start to chant Allah Allah Allah God God God that's God you know um curious historical footnote um when the Moors invaded southern Spain they took this custom with them and the pronunciation changed over the centuries from Allah Allah Allah to oay o oay which you still here in bull fights and in Flamingo dances in Spain when a performer has done something impossible and Magic Allah oay oay allaha magnificent Bravo incomprehensible there it is a glimpse of God which is great because we need that um but the tricky bit comes the next morning right for the dancer himself when he wakes up and discovers that it's Tuesday at 11:00 a.m. and he's no longer a glimpse of God um he's just an aging mortal with really bad knees and you know maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again and maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins and what is he then to do with the rest of his life this is hard this is one of the most painful reconciliations to make in a creative life you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] I am a writer writing books is my profession but it's more than that of course it is also my great Lifelong Love and Fascination and I don't expect that that's ever going to change but that said um something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career which has caused me to have to sort of recalibrate my whole relationship with this work and um The Peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book this Memoir called eat prey love um which decidedly unlike any of my previous books um went out in the world for some reason and became this big Mega sensation International bestseller thing the result of which is that everywhere I go now now people treat me like I'm doomed um seriously doomed doomed like they come up to me now like all worried and they say aren't you afraid um aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that um aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life and you're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all ever again so that's reassuring you know um but it would be worse except for that I I happen to remember that over 20 years ago when I I first started telling people when I was a teenager that I wanted to be a writer I was met with this same kind of sort of fear-based reaction and people would say aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it and you're going to die on a scrap heap of Broken Dreams with your mouth filled with bitter Ash of failure like that you know and um the answer short answer answer to all those questions is yes um yes I'm afraid of all those things and I always have been and I'm afraid of many many more things besides that you know people can't even guess at like um seaweed and and other things that are scary but when it comes to writing um the the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately and wondering about lately is why you know is it rational is it logical that um anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do you know um and what is it specifically about creative Ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don't do you know um like my dad for example was a chemical engineer and um I don't recall once in his 40 Years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer you know it just didn't come like get chemical engineering block John you know how's it going and um it it just didn't come up like that you know but to be fair right um chemical Engineers as a group you know haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries for being alcoholic manic depressives um and we writers you know we kind of do have that reputation and not not just writers but creative people across all genres it seems have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable um and you know all you have to do is look at the very Grim death count in the 20th century alone of of really magnificent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands you know um and even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts you know um Norman maor just before he died last interview he said every one of my books has killed me a little more an extraordinary statement to make about your life's work you know but we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked and that Artistry in the end will always ultimately lead to anguish and the question that I want to ask everybody here today is um are you guys all cool with that idea like are you comfortable with that because um you look at it even from an inch away and you know I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption I think it's odious and I also think it's dangerous and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next Century I think better if we encourage you know our great creative minds to live you know um and uh and I I definitely know that in in my case in my situation um it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path of assumption you know particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career which is you know like check it out I'm pretty young I'm only about 40 years old I still have maybe another four Decades of work left in me and it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after the freakish success of my last book right um I I should just put it bluntly because we're all sort of friends here now it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me you know um so Jesus what a thought you know like that's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking Jin at 9:00 in the morning and you know I don't want to go there you know I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love and so the question becomes how you know and and so it seems to me upon a lot of reflection that that the way that I have to work now in order to continue writing is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct right I have to sort of find some way to have a a safe distance you know between me as I am writing and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be from now on and and as I've been looking over the last year for like models for how to do that I've been sort of looking across time and I've been trying to find like other societies to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have about how to help um creative people sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of um of creativity and that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome um so stay with me because it does circle around back but um ancient Greece and ancient Rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then okay people believed that creativity was this Divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source for distant and unknowable reasons the Greeks famously called these Divine attendant spirits of creativity Damons Socrates famously

you know um but maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of Anguish if you never happened to believe in the first place that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you but maybe if you just believe that they were unloan to you you know from some unimaginable source for some Exquisite portion of your life to be passed along when you're finished with somebody else and you know if we think about it this way it starts to change everything you know this is how I've started to think and this is certainly how I was thinking about it in the last few months you know as um I've been working on the book that will soon be published as the dangerously frighteningly over anticipated followup to my um freakish success um and and and what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psyched out about that is um Don't Be Afraid don't be daunted just do your job continue to show up for your piece of it whatever that might be if your job is to dance do your dance if the Divine cockeyed genius assigned to your case decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed for just one moment through your efforts then Olay and if not do your dance anyhow and Olay to you nonetheless I believe this and I feel like we must teach it o lay to you nonetheless just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness to keep showing up thank [Applause] you thank [Applause] you than you thank [Applause] you thank you

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why do we see illusions? I'm going to tell you
about some of my research, where I provided evidence
for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers. At the center where
those radial lines are, it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it's a remarkably simple stimulus. It's just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe be unable to render
this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer
questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain
is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle
the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain
encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you've been encountering
this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina. They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version
of what happens in real life and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines
in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines. The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving. When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff, and it tells you
the direction you're moving. Alright, that's half the story. That's what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it's looking at the first image, that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center. It still doesn't explain why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand
that our brains are slow. What you would like
is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn't work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long, but it's a long time in normal behaviors. If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn't correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped
into it or just passed it. And of course, this
is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception
should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can't passively respond
and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess
about the next moment. What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you'll have a perception
of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain
this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving. What happens to them? Well, let's imagine. Imagine you've got a doorway. You've got a doorway. Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,
to make it more concrete -- it'll be helpful in a second. When you're very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens
when you get closer. It all flows outwards
in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you're really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more
like this next picture. The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem, there's just two vertical lines and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you're going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear
in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future, because they're just
static images on the page, they're not changing like in real life. And let me just end
by showing one illusion here. If I can, I'll quickly show two. This one's fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines, your brain says,
"They're probably already moving, that's why they're blurry." When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn't be moving that much. And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving. You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be. It's weird, right? But what you have now are the cues
that, from your brain's point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like,
"Oh, these things are moving." Render a perception
of what they'll do in the next moment -- they should be moving
and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much. (Applause)

to make it more concrete -- it'll be helpful in a second. When you're very far away from it, the sides are perfectly parallel. But now imagine what happens
when you get closer. It all flows outwards
in your visual field, flowing outwards. But when you're really close -- imagine the sides of the doorway
are here and here, but if you look up at this cathedral
doorway and do your fingers like this, the sides of the doorway are going up, like railroad tracks in the sky. What started off as two parallel lines, in fact, bows outwards at eye level, and doesn't go outwards
nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more
like this next picture. The projective geometry --
that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
in the next moment. So when you have a stimulus like this,
well, your brain has no problem, there's just two vertical lines and no cues that there'll be a change
in the next moment, so just render it as it is. But if you add cues -- and this is just one of many kinds of cues that can lead to these kinds of illusions, this very strong optic blur cue -- then you're going to perceive instead exactly how it will appear
in the next moment. All of our perceptions are always
trying to be about the present, but you have to perceive the future
to, in fact, perceive the present. And these illusions are failed
perceptions of the future, because they're just
static images on the page, they're not changing like in real life. And let me just end
by showing one illusion here. If I can, I'll quickly show two. This one's fun. If you just fixate at the middle there, and make stabbing motions with your head, looming towards it like this. Everybody do that. Make short, stabbing motions. Because I've added blur
to these optic flow lines, your brain says,
"They're probably already moving, that's why they're blurry." When you do it, they should
be bursting out in your visual field faster than they should. They shouldn't be moving that much. And a final one I'll just leave
in the background is this. Here are the cues of motion, the kinds of cues that you get
on your retina when things are moving. You don't have to do
anything -- just look at it. Raise your hand if things are moving
when they shouldn't be. It's weird, right? But what you have now are the cues
that, from your brain's point of view, you have the stimulus on your eyes, like,
"Oh, these things are moving." Render a perception
of what they'll do in the next moment -- they should be moving
and they should have shifted. Alright, thank you very much. (Applause)

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Why do we see illusions? I'm going to tell you
about some of my research, where I provided evidence
for a different kind of hypothesis than the one that might be in the book on your coffee stand. Alright, so let's look
at one of the illusions here. And this is a stand-in for many,
many kinds of illusions that are explained by this hypothesis. I'm just going to walk through it
for this particular one. As usual in these things, these two lines are, in fact, parallel, but you perceive them to bow
outwards at their centers. At the center where
those radial lines are, it's wider in your visual field
than the parts above and below. And this is remarkable, because it's a remarkably simple stimulus. It's just a bunch of straight lines. Why should one of the most
complicated objects in the universe be unable to render
this incredibly simple image? When you want to answer
questions like this, you need to ask, well, what might this mean to your brain? And what your brain
is going to think this is, is not some lines on a page. Your brain has evolved to handle
the kinds of natural stimuli that it encounters in real life. So when does the brain
encounter stimuli like this? Well, it seems a bit odd, but in fact, you've been encountering
this stimulus all day long. Whenever you move, whenever you move forward, in particular. When you move forward, you get optic flow, flowing outwards in your visual field, like when the Enterprise goes into warp. All of these objects flow outwards and they leave trails,
or blur lines, on your retina. They're activating
mini-neurons all in a row. So, this is a version
of what happens in real life and this another version
of what happens in real life all the time. In fact, cartoonists know about this. They put these blur lines
in their cartoons and it means to your brain: motion. Now, it's not that in real life
you see blur lines. The point is that it's the stimulus
at the back of your eye that has these optic blurs in them, and that's what tells your brain
that you're moving. When you move forward,
your eyes fixate like cameras, like snapshot cameras, it fixates, it fixates,
little (Snapshot sound) camera shots, and each time it fixates
when you're moving forward, you get all this flowing outwards. So when you take a fixation, you end up with this weird
optic blur stuff, and it tells you
the direction you're moving. Alright, that's half the story. That's what this stimulus means. It means that your brain thinks, when it's looking at the first image, that you're actually on your way,
moving towards the center. It still doesn't explain why you should perceive
these straight lines as bowed outwards. To understand the rest of the story, you have to understand
that our brains are slow. What you would like
is that when light hits your eye, then -- ping! -- immediately
you have a perception of what the world is like. But it doesn't work that way. It takes about a tenth of a second
for your perception to be created. And a tenth of a second
doesn't sound very long, but it's a long time in normal behaviors. If you're moving just at one meter
per second, which is fairly slow, then in a tenth of second,
you've moved 10 centimeters. So if you didn't correct for this delay, then anything that you perceived
to be within 10 centimeters of you, by the time you perceived it, you would have bumped
into it or just passed it. And of course, this
is going to be much worse -- (Laughter) it's going to be much worse
in a situation like this. Your perception is behind. What you want is that your perception
should look like this. You want your perceptions at any time T to be of the world at time T. But the only way your brain
can do that, is that it has to, instead of generating a perception
of the way the world was when light hit your retina, it has to do something fancier. It can't passively respond
and create a best guess, it has to create a best guess
about the next moment. What will the world look like
in a tenth of a second? Build a perception of that, because by the time your perception
of the near future occurs in your brain, the near future will have arrived and you'll have a perception
of the present, which is what you want. In my research, I provided a lot of evidence --
and there's other research areas that have provided evidence -- that the brain is filled with mechanisms that try to compensate for its slowness. And I've shown that huge swaths
of illusions are explained by this, this just being one example. But let me finish by saying, how exactly does this explain
this particular example? So, the question, really, we have to ask is: how do those two vertical lines
in that first stimulus, how do they change in the next moment were I moving towards the center, that all those optical lines
are suggesting that I'm moving. What happens to them? Well, let's imagine. Imagine you've got a doorway. You've got a doorway. Imagine it's a cathedral doorway,

nearly as much above. So in the next moment, you have a shape that's more

that is, the way the things project, in fact, change in this way
