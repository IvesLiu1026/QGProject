**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What are the three core strategies for peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power?**

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the primary focus of the speaker in discussing the limitations of protest, which is to highlight the need for additional actions beyond protests to achieve lasting political impact. Question 3 is related to this idea, as it asks about the strategies for turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power, which implies that protest alone is not sufficient.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more similar in terms of options and content, I would choose:

**Question 10: What is the key to creating lasting positive change, according to the transcript?**

This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and content, as it directly asks about the key to creating lasting positive change, which is the main idea of the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would recommend **Question 10** as the most similar generated MCQ.

Index: 10

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What was the outcome of the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East?**

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same topic and has a similar intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about what protest alone cannot achieve, and one of the options (B) mentions "Effectively selecting new democratic leaders." The Arab Spring protests are mentioned in the transcript as an example of protests that were able to topple dictators but failed to establish stable democracies, leading to the rise of militant and violent groups. This outcome is related to the idea that protest alone may not be sufficient to achieve lasting positive change, such as effectively selecting new democratic leaders.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 2**

But please keep in mind that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs could be improved to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

**Question 8: What is an example of a successful early win mentioned in the transcript?**

Although this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about historical movements that exemplify the long, slow slog of securing wins, while Question 8 asks about an example of a successful early win mentioned in the transcript. However, the options in Question 8 include the solidarity movement in Poland, which is mentioned in the transcript as an example of a successful movement that achieved an early win and ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. The other options in Question 8 are not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, but the question itself is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest that Question 10 is the closest match.

Question 10 asks about the key to creating lasting positive change, and option B mentions "showing up after the protest and participating in the grind."

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container.

Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is self-assembly?
Options: A. A process by which individuals build objects without the influence of others, B. The journey from despair to happiness, a self help model, C. A system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, D. Topics ranging from chemistry to literature, as long as it has to do with self reflection

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.
