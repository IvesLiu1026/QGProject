**Transcript**:
(Music) Aw, thank you, thank you. As you can probably tell, I'm an astronaut. No, I'm a DJ/Producer, as it says on the screen. I am also a high school student, just like many of you guys. How many high school students do we have out here? (Cheers) Oh, okay! A good amount. I'm a proud member of my school's marching band, and I run track, as well, so if any of you guys are into that, it's one of my other passions. I have been DJing and producing for a little over three years now, and I've worked with artists that you may know, like Avicii, Skrillex, Major Lazer, Krewella, Porter Robinsion, Carnage, and many others. How many of you guys like dance music? Show off hands, dance music, oh okay. How many of you guys like rap or trap hip hop? Okay, good amount. Jazz? Classical? That's good, you guys have smart minds, that's good. What's great about DJing is that you can combine all these genres into one idea, and what I like to do is combine dance, hip hop, trap, dubstep, even movie samples, and kind of combine them into one set. DJing creates this, sort of, combined culture that really unites many fans. A good example of this is Skrillex and A$AP Rocky's collaboration "Wild for the Night" or, most recently, Avicii and Ella Black's "Wake Me Up." How many of you guys know that song? It's a great track. Now, what exactly does a DJ do? Well, as you just saw earlier, they mix tracks. What I just did was mix a Kanye West intro from "Black Skinheads" with a track called "LRAD." One of the main goals is to really trigger samples, tracks, or clips and kind of create this long journey. I'm going to do another little example for you guys right now of what DJs call a "mashup," which is taking two or more tracks and combining them into one. This mashup was made famous by a Hungarian duo Myon & Shane 54, and it takes the vocals from Krewella's "Alive." How many of you guys know that song? "Alive"? Yeah, okay. I'm going to take the vocals from that track and the song "Language" by Porter Robinson. So, let me just play you the vocals first. (Music) So, that's the vocals, and here's the actual track. (Music) So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals on top of the track and create a new song, a kind of combined song, with the two vocals. (Music) If you turn it down, you can just hear I'm playing it a capella or just the song by itself. (Music) Now, what I'm going to do after this drops is change it into another song. One of the most important things about dance music is really the drop, so I'm going to change it into another song and really catch you by surprise. (Music) And that's one example right there. (Applause) So, as you saw, I took three different songs and kind of combined them into one new idea, which is something plenty of DJs do out there on the professional circuit. There are plenty of ways to get started DJing. One of the main things I did was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me. Whether it was watching podcasts, watching live sets, or just really looking them up online. I really tried to take in what it meant to be a fantastic DJ. One of the best ways to really learn is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ. Just go over there, ask him a few questions. If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources. One of the things you can do is check out YouTube, check out some demonstrations. Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them, check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks. There are also many other blog sites, such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce, or Dancing Astronaut. Now, there are multiple ways to DJ, and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl, by legends such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold, can now be done with many more pieces of equipment, such as CDJs, which are, sort of, digital turntables and what I learned on and what I still use to this day. There are many other amazing programs now, such as Ableton, Traktor Pro, Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens. There are many hardware systems just like my APC40 here that can launch samples, clips and tracks. You can also just use turntables, CDJs, an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad. And all of these really kind of do the same thing, and that's mix tracks. So, what I'm going to do now is show you guys another mix demonstration. I'm going to start with one of my own songs that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky, and from there I'm going to go in a sort of medley of different tracks and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do. (Music) So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track, so you can hear it coming in. (Music) You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in. (Music) Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer, and a mixer has many different effects, such as a beat roll, filter effects, and any other different ones. There's plenty of effects to use. (Music) So, now I'm going into a new song, and after this drops, I'm going to drop it in another song and kind of change it up. (Music) And that's a new song bite. (Music) So I'm just going to straight mash up another song right when this one breaks down. (Music) Now, if I want to change up the music, let's say, throw in some new beats, I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown. (Music) So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now. (Music) And that is the end of that demo. (Applause) Thank you, thank you! Now, the great thing about technologies now is whether it's a two dollar app or a couple hundred dollar equipment, which I'm sure most parents won't want to buy for their child, is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing and a passion for the music and who might want to pursue a career in it really has the ability to, well, pursue it, such as myself. You can start with an app on a tablet or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad, and then move on to bigger equipment. The opportunities are endless, and, as you saw, you can mix many different styles of music. So, thank you!

If you remember back to the last caesium video,
Pete and Neil tried to launch a bit of caesium metal into water with the small metallic collider
and they had a few problems with surface area and caesium still being stuck in the glass
as well. What I have been asked to do today, is take
this ampoule of caesium into this piece of machinery here which is one of our glove boxes,
try and get it out of the glass so that we can put it in as is. Caesium has quite a surprising use, it is
used to measure time. I don’t know if you have ever thought about it but you could define
one second as a fraction of a day, one sixtieth of a minute which is which is a sixtieth of
an hour which is then a twenty fourth of a day. But the trouble with that is that you
will never be able to tell if the earth was going slower or speeding up because the length
of the day would change and you would not notice it so scientists have to have an independent
way of defining the second and this is where caesium comes in. And so now the caesium is going in as well.
Alright, so we will shut the port door So the way in which scientists define the
second is in terms of microwaves and the frequency of the microwaves, we need a standard, something
that can define a radiowave very very precisely, and this is where caesium comes in. So what I need to do now is open up this door
here. The point about caesium is that it is a big
atom it can absorb microwaves, the absorption of the microwave causes an electron to move
from one energy level to another and the advantage of caesium over all other materials is that
this frequency is enormously precise. It is pretty cool it is really good, it is
sort of a really pale gold colour. It is still molten at the moment. It is rather like tuning a radio, I don’t
know if you’ve ever tuned a radio but as you turn the knob, sometimes, you don’t
have to be very precise , you can put it almost anywhere and you get your favourite station,
but there are some stations where you have to adjust it very very accurately and there
is just one tiny place where you can get the right radio station and caesium is like that,
it defines the frequency very very accurately, if you don’t hit it right it does not absorb
the radiowaves and so you can use it as a standard, so make sure so make sure that everybody
has exactly the same frequency of their microwave and then once everybody has got the same,
then it is quite easy for everybody to agree that they will count a certain number of waves
as being a second. We are going to store the caesium under oil
so that it does not react with air when it comes out. So this is ready now for Pete to
chuck it in some water and we will stand very far back when he does it. So we have got caesium, we have taken it out
of the ampoule, Neil did that the other day with Debbie in their glove box, they have
put it into a small plastic weighing boat and immersed it in oil so it can’t react
with air . Now what we need to do is a very technical operation is to punch a hole into
the plastic boat so that we can lift it out with a piece of string so we can drop it into
some water. I’ve got my friend, Dr Red. It is always good to be very very careful
when you are doing chemistry like this, just in case it goes wrong we have the safety procedures
in place for us, in case we get surprised. So now Neil is going to pass a piece of string
through the hole so that we can put it at the end of a pretty long fishing line so that
we can drop it into water. So this is Neil’s new device, it’s a very
very fancy erection. Essentially we have used a laboratory stand, and we have an eyelet
so this is just to act as a point where we can raise up our caesium on a piece of string.
At the moment, the caesium you can see is a lovely gold colour. Would you believe me,
it’s melting. Look at it. Oh yeah it’s very warm here
today and the caesium’s melted. So we are just going to try and freeze it again. Well we are going to try and refreeze the
caesium by cooling it with liquid nitrogen. Ok everybody be careful. So we have our caesium under oil. We now need
to lift it up using the new device, and then drop it in the water, and let’s see what
kind of chemical reaction it does today. Everybody ready? Neil? Yep! Wow, quite a spectacular reaction. As the
caesium reacted with the water, gave away its electron, off she goes, it’s caesium
plus. Awesome, it was pretty good. Yeah, it’s pretty great you know when, when
Debbie and Neil took the caesium out of the ampoule they were really really good for us
because they gave us a really large surface area, so it could react quickly as soon as
it went in the water. Generating all that lovely hydrogen ready to explode and make
a bang. Great, good chemistry. Well, the reason that caesium reacts so violently
is that it is a very large atom, so an electron can be removed very easily, in fact if you
dissolve caesium in water, on a very short time scale, a millionth of a second or so,
it dissociates into caesium-plus and an electron, and the energy of the electron interacting
with the water is enough to separate the two and once the electron is in the water, it
then reacts with the water so that H2O dissociates into a hydrogen atom and OH-minus, so in fact
what you are making is a caesium salt which is rather like caustic soda, it’s a strong
alkali and hydrogen, and it is the rapid formation of hydrogen gas that causes part of the shock
of the reaction and then the hydrogen will usually catch fire and react with the oxygen
in the air to give you a small explosion or a big one depending how much caesium you’ve
used.

If you remember back to the last caesium video,
Pete and Neil tried to launch a bit of caesium metal into water with the small metallic collider
and they had a few problems with surface area and caesium still being stuck in the glass
as well. What I have been asked to do today, is take
this ampoule of caesium into this piece of machinery here which is one of our glove boxes,
try and get it out of the glass so that we can put it in as is. Caesium has quite a surprising use, it is
used to measure time. I don’t know if you have ever thought about it but you could define
one second as a fraction of a day, one sixtieth of a minute which is which is a sixtieth of
an hour which is then a twenty fourth of a day. But the trouble with that is that you
will never be able to tell if the earth was going slower or speeding up because the length
of the day would change and you would not notice it so scientists have to have an independent

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8: What is the result of the reaction between caesium and water?

Although the question is not an exact match, the correct option (A) mentions the formation of a caesium salt and hydrogen gas, which can catch fire and explode. This is related to the pH level of the water, as the formation of a caesium salt (a strong alkali) would increase the pH level of the water.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the pH level of the water after the reaction. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the pH level.

Considering the available options, I would choose Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8

two days ago I got an email sadly announcing the death of Neil Bartlett who is the scientist who's probably done most for the chemistry of xenon since it was first discovered at the end of the 19th century so in the balloon we've got a sample of xenon now xenon's one of the inert gases but it's one of the inert gases that's right the way down the bottom of the period so it's really really dense so what that means is that the gas molecules themselves are really really large really really heavy so in principle they'll sink Neil Bartlett discovered that Xenon which everyone had thought was a completely inert element had really could form reactions and could form compounds something that nobody thought was possible until then and this took place in the early 1960s and I've got a picture here of his iconic experiment he did his experiment I think in late 1962 and perhaps early 63 and this was published just over a year later and these are two exp pictures this is the experiment before and after so we've done an experiment here and we filled this balloon with Xenon now Xenon is very expensive so there's about 40 pounds worth of xenon in this balloon right now yeah so we're going to do this experiment and we're going to see if it sinks and I think you'll agree that it does sink quite quickly what he did was he took a glass bulb of a compound of Platinum Platinum hexafluoride ptf6 which is a gas now that's quite unusual to have a metal compound that's a gas but it's rather nice bright orange gas and he put together a piece of equipment here where in this tube here there is xenon gas which is colorless and this is a magnet which can be lifted up and break a tiny seal so that the two gases can mix but just to show you how dense it is we've got a similar balloon but you'll notice that this balloon is much much higher filled so it's much much bigger now this is one that we've just blown up with air so now what had happened was before this experiment was done with Xenon that one of Neil's students had discovered that Platinum hexafluoride reacted with oxygen in air to form a compound in which one electron had been removed from the oxygen to make O2 plus and this was a solid material it was itself quite a surprising reaction now what Neil did was that he looked at the periodic table and wondered which other elements required about the same amount of energy as oxygen to remove one electron and he came up with Xenon so he tried this experiment using the apparatus here they lifted this Magnet or he lifted this magnet it crashed down the Xenon rusting and suddenly this red gas was turned into a yellow solid in fact it turned out he was doing this experiment with his student but the student whose name I've forgotten had to go home so Neil did this experiment by himself and he was very late getting home for his dinner and his wife according to him on this video was really very angry but chemistry had been transformed well this experiment was voted by um American chemist is one of the top 10 most important chemical experiments that had been done in the 20th century so let's see if we can compare the rates at which these two balloons will sink so we can look at the comparative densities ready Xenon exists in the air and when people liquefy air they first of all separate the nitrogen and then the oxygen for and at the end they're left with the noble gases argon Krypton and Xenon so it is made from the air and one of the problems with this price rise of xenon was that at the same time as there was a bigger demand for Xenon there was a downturn in the steel making industry which uses a lot of oxygen so the chemical plants that were or the refrigeration plants that were making Xena oxygen were switched off so there was a smaller supply of xenon this is an old-fashioned Xenon lamp the Xenon in this bulb and you put a large voltage through here and the Xenon gets very hot and shines out as a very bright light um it looks black here because the electrodes get so hot that the metal has evaporated but Xenon itself is colorless this is a more modern Xenon lamp of the sort of lamp that is used in very powerful spotlights for example on tanks to illuminate that's military tanks to illuminate the Target and the window here is made of aluminum oxide and all the light comes out as a really very powerful beam

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the behavior of different noble gases (neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) in air, specifically whether they will float or sink.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the most relevant, as it discusses a property of Xenon (density) that affects its behavior in air.

Question 4: What is the property of Xenon that causes it to sink quickly? Options: A. It is very light, B. It is very dense, C. It is very inexpensive, D. It is very abundant

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Therefore, I would suggest:

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

**Transcript**:
Cadmium? Yes Ok Oh yeah, that’s some! That is cool man! So cadmium is an element which is really quite
similar to mercury and the way that most people have
seen cadmium is that cadmium sulphide has a very strong orange
colour and it is therefore used for dying things yellow
or orange. If you look round your house or your parents’ house,
you may easily find a cast iron pot which has, a cooking
pot, which has nice orange sides and orange lid and this is using
cadmium sulphide as a glaze. So this is a sample which was generated or
which was used by some of our researchers in the School of
Chemistry many years ago and this is a sample of cadmium
metal. Now it’s very interesting because it is stored in this
really quite nice box which was perhaps a medication that somebody
had bought, but if we open it… It's also I believe, to colour the plastic
pipe that you see in the street for gas pipes and so on. I think
it is coloured with a cadmium compound. Now in both these applications,
even though that cadmium is quite poisonous, that
they are so strongly fixed into the materials that it
isn’t a threat to people. And we can see the lumps of the metallic cadmium.
Now I am not going to touch the cadmium because we
know of some of the issues with toxicity. But it is used very
often in batteries, or it was traditionally used in batteries.
It is really important that we dispose of our batteries in a correct
way.

So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So we’re here today and we’ve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because we’re going to do something quite exciting. Because Brady’s
bought another camera which you can see he’s setup over
there and we’re going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and we’re going to do
some time lapse. Something I’ve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if you’re
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you don’t find them
naturally. So I thought what we’d do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So we’re going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. It’s a bit like a game of football.
We’re going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case it’s another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope we’ll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that you’ve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench I’ve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So we’ve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they can’t play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, I’m going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here I’ve got a sample of
silver nitrate. It’s sensitive to light so I can’t leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, I’m going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that there’s
plenty in there so that it’s saturated. Now we’ve
got to put in the competitor. So what we’re going to do, we’re
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which I’ve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all I’m going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then it’s going to start to compete for the nitrate and we’ll see what happens. So Brady’s started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now we’re going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder we’re going to make today is a
two component mixture. It’s very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neil’s just weighing the materials out right now. So we’re going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. We’re going to mix them very,
very carefully and then we’re going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one that’s made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So we’re mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here I’ve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesn’t look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that it’s
got particles in it because, if I can find a torch… So here we’ve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect that’s called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So let’s start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that they’ve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So we’re going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-B…
SQUAWCKS That’s going to come out somewhere isn’t
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If you’ve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So we’re going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time we’re going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. We’ll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasn’t returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, I’ve managed to fill maybe one minute’s
worth of time by now maybe two because we’ve been
away about two hours. So we’re going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So let’s go and have a look. There’s been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. It’s now going into the solution; it’s taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
it’s blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So we’re here today and we’ve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because we’re going to do something quite exciting. Because Brady’s
bought another camera which you can see he’s setup over
there and we’re going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and we’re going to do
some time lapse. Something I’ve seen on TV with like flowers

**Transcript**:
So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So we’re here today and we’ve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because we’re going to do something quite exciting. Because Brady’s
bought another camera which you can see he’s setup over
there and we’re going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and we’re going to do
some time lapse. Something I’ve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if you’re
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you don’t find them
naturally. So I thought what we’d do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So we’re going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. It’s a bit like a game of football.
We’re going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case it’s another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope we’ll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that you’ve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench I’ve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So we’ve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they can’t play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, I’m going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here I’ve got a sample of
silver nitrate. It’s sensitive to light so I can’t leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, I’m going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that there’s
plenty in there so that it’s saturated. Now we’ve
got to put in the competitor. So what we’re going to do, we’re
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which I’ve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all I’m going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then it’s going to start to compete for the nitrate and we’ll see what happens. So Brady’s started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now we’re going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder we’re going to make today is a
two component mixture. It’s very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neil’s just weighing the materials out right now. So we’re going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. We’re going to mix them very,
very carefully and then we’re going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one that’s made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So we’re mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here I’ve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesn’t look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that it’s
got particles in it because, if I can find a torch… So here we’ve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect that’s called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So let’s start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that they’ve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So we’re going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-B…
SQUAWCKS That’s going to come out somewhere isn’t
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If you’ve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So we’re going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time we’re going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. We’ll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasn’t returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, I’ve managed to fill maybe one minute’s
worth of time by now maybe two because we’ve been
away about two hours. So we’re going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So let’s go and have a look. There’s been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. It’s now going into the solution; it’s taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
it’s blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the properties of silver.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the properties of silver, specifically its electrical and thermal conductivity. Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 mentions a use of silver nanoparticles, but it does not directly relate to the properties of silver.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the properties of silver, including its conductivity, in the following sentence:

"Silver will conduct electricity, it will also conduct heat."

Based on this information, I would suggest that a new generated MCQ could be created to match the ground truth MCQ. However, among the existing generated MCQs, I could not find a direct match.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the properties of silver, I would suggest Question 8, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (with low confidence)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ would be needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

**Transcript**:
Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the nickname Wollaston gave to Palladium after he started selling it, and the correct answer is "The new silver". Question 5 asks about the price of Palladium in 1802, according to Weston's advertisement, but it mentions the advertisement, which is where the nickname "The new silver" is mentioned in the transcript.

However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the nickname Wollaston gave to Palladium. Therefore, I will choose the generated MCQ that is closest to the topic.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ is about the speaker's statement that "the best editing gives us a little bit of both" and provides options that illustrate this concept.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7: What is the problem with algorithmic filters, according to the speaker? Options: A. They give us too much information., B. They give us too little information., C. They throw off the balance of our information diet and surround us with information junk food., D. They are not personalized enough.

Although this generated MCQ does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it touches on the idea of balance in the information we receive, which is related to the concept of "the best editing gives us a little bit of both."

However, since none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that specifically targets the concept mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level.

Index: 7 (with low confidence)

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: Why is the gas in galaxy clusters so hot?

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and options of Question 4 are related to the X-ray emission and the temperature of galaxy clusters, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ, "Galaxy clusters should be cooling over time," is implied by the fact that galaxy clusters are radiating X-rays, which means they are losing energy and should be cooling down. This is not explicitly stated in Question 4, but the question does address the related topic of why the gas in galaxy clusters is hot.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them exactly match the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is focused on the conservation of energy and the cooling of galaxy clusters over time, which is not explicitly addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 4, but with the caveat that it is not a perfect match.

It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster.

The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color.

**Transcript**:
Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up
when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so much
that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time. The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.

**Transcript**:
Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up
when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so much
that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time. The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing

**Transcript**:
(Music) Aw, thank you, thank you. As you can probably tell, I'm an astronaut. No, I'm a DJ/Producer, as it says on the screen. I am also a high school student, just like many of you guys. How many high school students do we have out here? (Cheers) Oh, okay! A good amount. I'm a proud member of my school's marching band, and I run track, as well, so if any of you guys are into that, it's one of my other passions. I have been DJing and producing for a little over three years now, and I've worked with artists that you may know, like Avicii, Skrillex, Major Lazer, Krewella, Porter Robinsion, Carnage, and many others. How many of you guys like dance music? Show off hands, dance music, oh okay. How many of you guys like rap or trap hip hop? Okay, good amount. Jazz? Classical? That's good, you guys have smart minds, that's good. What's great about DJing is that you can combine all these genres into one idea, and what I like to do is combine dance, hip hop, trap, dubstep, even movie samples, and kind of combine them into one set. DJing creates this, sort of, combined culture that really unites many fans. A good example of this is Skrillex and A$AP Rocky's collaboration "Wild for the Night" or, most recently, Avicii and Ella Black's "Wake Me Up." How many of you guys know that song? It's a great track. Now, what exactly does a DJ do? Well, as you just saw earlier, they mix tracks. What I just did was mix a Kanye West intro from "Black Skinheads" with a track called "LRAD." One of the main goals is to really trigger samples, tracks, or clips and kind of create this long journey. I'm going to do another little example for you guys right now of what DJs call a "mashup," which is taking two or more tracks and combining them into one. This mashup was made famous by a Hungarian duo Myon & Shane 54, and it takes the vocals from Krewella's "Alive." How many of you guys know that song? "Alive"? Yeah, okay. I'm going to take the vocals from that track and the song "Language" by Porter Robinson. So, let me just play you the vocals first. (Music) So, that's the vocals, and here's the actual track. (Music) So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals on top of the track and create a new song, a kind of combined song, with the two vocals. (Music) If you turn it down, you can just hear I'm playing it a capella or just the song by itself. (Music) Now, what I'm going to do after this drops is change it into another song. One of the most important things about dance music is really the drop, so I'm going to change it into another song and really catch you by surprise. (Music) And that's one example right there. (Applause) So, as you saw, I took three different songs and kind of combined them into one new idea, which is something plenty of DJs do out there on the professional circuit. There are plenty of ways to get started DJing. One of the main things I did was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me. Whether it was watching podcasts, watching live sets, or just really looking them up online. I really tried to take in what it meant to be a fantastic DJ. One of the best ways to really learn is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ. Just go over there, ask him a few questions. If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources. One of the things you can do is check out YouTube, check out some demonstrations. Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them, check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks. There are also many other blog sites, such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce, or Dancing Astronaut. Now, there are multiple ways to DJ, and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl, by legends such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold, can now be done with many more pieces of equipment, such as CDJs, which are, sort of, digital turntables and what I learned on and what I still use to this day. There are many other amazing programs now, such as Ableton, Traktor Pro, Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens. There are many hardware systems just like my APC40 here that can launch samples, clips and tracks. You can also just use turntables, CDJs, an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad. And all of these really kind of do the same thing, and that's mix tracks. So, what I'm going to do now is show you guys another mix demonstration. I'm going to start with one of my own songs that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky, and from there I'm going to go in a sort of medley of different tracks and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do. (Music) So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track, so you can hear it coming in. (Music) You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in. (Music) Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer, and a mixer has many different effects, such as a beat roll, filter effects, and any other different ones. There's plenty of effects to use. (Music) So, now I'm going into a new song, and after this drops, I'm going to drop it in another song and kind of change it up. (Music) And that's a new song bite. (Music) So I'm just going to straight mash up another song right when this one breaks down. (Music) Now, if I want to change up the music, let's say, throw in some new beats, I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown. (Music) So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now. (Music) And that is the end of that demo. (Applause) Thank you, thank you! Now, the great thing about technologies now is whether it's a two dollar app or a couple hundred dollar equipment, which I'm sure most parents won't want to buy for their child, is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing and a passion for the music and who might want to pursue a career in it really has the ability to, well, pursue it, such as myself. You can start with an app on a tablet or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad, and then move on to bigger equipment. The opportunities are endless, and, as you saw, you can mix many different styles of music. So, thank you!

**Transcript**:
(Music) Aw, thank you, thank you. As you can probably tell, I'm an astronaut. No, I'm a DJ/Producer, as it says on the screen. I am also a high school student, just like many of you guys. How many high school students do we have out here? (Cheers) Oh, okay! A good amount. I'm a proud member of my school's marching band, and I run track, as well, so if any of you guys are into that, it's one of my other passions. I have been DJing and producing for a little over three years now, and I've worked with artists that you may know, like Avicii, Skrillex, Major Lazer, Krewella, Porter Robinsion, Carnage, and many others. How many of you guys like dance music? Show off hands, dance music, oh okay. How many of you guys like rap or trap hip hop? Okay, good amount. Jazz? Classical? That's good, you guys have smart minds, that's good. What's great about DJing is that you can combine all these genres into one idea, and what I like to do is combine dance, hip hop, trap, dubstep, even movie samples, and kind of combine them into one set. DJing creates this, sort of, combined culture that really unites many fans. A good example of this is Skrillex and A$AP Rocky's collaboration "Wild for the Night" or, most recently, Avicii and Ella Black's "Wake Me Up." How many of you guys know that song? It's a great track. Now, what exactly does a DJ do? Well, as you just saw earlier, they mix tracks. What I just did was mix a Kanye West intro from "Black Skinheads" with a track called "LRAD." One of the main goals is to really trigger samples, tracks, or clips and kind of create this long journey. I'm going to do another little example for you guys right now of what DJs call a "mashup," which is taking two or more tracks and combining them into one. This mashup was made famous by a Hungarian duo Myon & Shane 54, and it takes the vocals from Krewella's "Alive." How many of you guys know that song? "Alive"? Yeah, okay. I'm going to take the vocals from that track and the song "Language" by Porter Robinson. So, let me just play you the vocals first. (Music) So, that's the vocals, and here's the actual track. (Music) So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to fill these vocals on top of the track and create a new song, a kind of combined song, with the two vocals. (Music) If you turn it down, you can just hear I'm playing it a capella or just the song by itself. (Music) Now, what I'm going to do after this drops is change it into another song. One of the most important things about dance music is really the drop, so I'm going to change it into another song and really catch you by surprise. (Music) And that's one example right there. (Applause) So, as you saw, I took three different songs and kind of combined them into one new idea, which is something plenty of DJs do out there on the professional circuit. There are plenty of ways to get started DJing. One of the main things I did was really take the time to study DJs that inspired me. Whether it was watching podcasts, watching live sets, or just really looking them up online. I really tried to take in what it meant to be a fantastic DJ. One of the best ways to really learn is to ask a friend, you know, a friend who knows how to DJ. Just go over there, ask him a few questions. If no that, thankfully we have a lot of great online resources. One of the things you can do is check out YouTube, check out some demonstrations. Now, many DJs, a high percentage of them, check out Beatport or Soundcloud to find a lot of the tracks. There are also many other blog sites, such as Billboard's CODE, EDMTunes, EDM Sauce, or Dancing Astronaut. Now, there are multiple ways to DJ, and what could originally only be done on turntables and vinyl, by legends such as Larry Levan, Grandmaster Flash, and Paul Oakenfold, can now be done with many more pieces of equipment, such as CDJs, which are, sort of, digital turntables and what I learned on and what I still use to this day. There are many other amazing programs now, such as Ableton, Traktor Pro, Serato, or even apps for tablets and touchscreens. There are many hardware systems just like my APC40 here that can launch samples, clips and tracks. You can also just use turntables, CDJs, an S4 controller, or an Novation Launchpad. And all of these really kind of do the same thing, and that's mix tracks. So, what I'm going to do now is show you guys another mix demonstration. I'm going to start with one of my own songs that I did with my friend Matt Dzyacky, and from there I'm going to go in a sort of medley of different tracks and show you the different styles of mixing that you can do. (Music) So I'll show you guys when I start mixing the new track, so you can hear it coming in. (Music) You can hear in the back, a new song is mixing in. (Music) Now, another thing that DJs use is what's called a mixer, and a mixer has many different effects, such as a beat roll, filter effects, and any other different ones. There's plenty of effects to use. (Music) So, now I'm going into a new song, and after this drops, I'm going to drop it in another song and kind of change it up. (Music) And that's a new song bite. (Music) So I'm just going to straight mash up another song right when this one breaks down. (Music) Now, if I want to change up the music, let's say, throw in some new beats, I can just choose a trap beat I want to throw over the breakdown. (Music) So, I get ready to throw in my new beats now. (Music) And that is the end of that demo. (Applause) Thank you, thank you! Now, the great thing about technologies now is whether it's a two dollar app or a couple hundred dollar equipment, which I'm sure most parents won't want to buy for their child, is that almost anyone who has a passion for DJing and a passion for the music and who might want to pursue a career in it really has the ability to, well, pursue it, such as myself. You can start with an app on a tablet or an app on your phone, even, an app on your iPad, and then move on to bigger equipment. The opportunities are endless, and, as you saw, you can mix many different styles of music. So, thank you!

**Transcript**:
If you remember back to the last caesium video,
Pete and Neil tried to launch a bit of caesium metal into water with the small metallic collider
and they had a few problems with surface area and caesium still being stuck in the glass
as well. What I have been asked to do today, is take
this ampoule of caesium into this piece of machinery here which is one of our glove boxes,
try and get it out of the glass so that we can put it in as is. Caesium has quite a surprising use, it is
used to measure time. I don’t know if you have ever thought about it but you could define
one second as a fraction of a day, one sixtieth of a minute which is which is a sixtieth of
an hour which is then a twenty fourth of a day. But the trouble with that is that you
will never be able to tell if the earth was going slower or speeding up because the length
of the day would change and you would not notice it so scientists have to have an independent
way of defining the second and this is where caesium comes in. And so now the caesium is going in as well.
Alright, so we will shut the port door So the way in which scientists define the
second is in terms of microwaves and the frequency of the microwaves, we need a standard, something
that can define a radiowave very very precisely, and this is where caesium comes in. So what I need to do now is open up this door
here. The point about caesium is that it is a big
atom it can absorb microwaves, the absorption of the microwave causes an electron to move
from one energy level to another and the advantage of caesium over all other materials is that
this frequency is enormously precise. It is pretty cool it is really good, it is
sort of a really pale gold colour. It is still molten at the moment. It is rather like tuning a radio, I don’t
know if you’ve ever tuned a radio but as you turn the knob, sometimes, you don’t
have to be very precise , you can put it almost anywhere and you get your favourite station,
but there are some stations where you have to adjust it very very accurately and there
is just one tiny place where you can get the right radio station and caesium is like that,
it defines the frequency very very accurately, if you don’t hit it right it does not absorb
the radiowaves and so you can use it as a standard, so make sure so make sure that everybody
has exactly the same frequency of their microwave and then once everybody has got the same,
then it is quite easy for everybody to agree that they will count a certain number of waves
as being a second. We are going to store the caesium under oil
so that it does not react with air when it comes out. So this is ready now for Pete to
chuck it in some water and we will stand very far back when he does it. So we have got caesium, we have taken it out
of the ampoule, Neil did that the other day with Debbie in their glove box, they have
put it into a small plastic weighing boat and immersed it in oil so it can’t react
with air . Now what we need to do is a very technical operation is to punch a hole into
the plastic boat so that we can lift it out with a piece of string so we can drop it into
some water. I’ve got my friend, Dr Red. It is always good to be very very careful
when you are doing chemistry like this, just in case it goes wrong we have the safety procedures
in place for us, in case we get surprised. So now Neil is going to pass a piece of string
through the hole so that we can put it at the end of a pretty long fishing line so that
we can drop it into water. So this is Neil’s new device, it’s a very
very fancy erection. Essentially we have used a laboratory stand, and we have an eyelet
so this is just to act as a point where we can raise up our caesium on a piece of string.
At the moment, the caesium you can see is a lovely gold colour. Would you believe me,
it’s melting. Look at it. Oh yeah it’s very warm here
today and the caesium’s melted. So we are just going to try and freeze it again. Well we are going to try and refreeze the
caesium by cooling it with liquid nitrogen. Ok everybody be careful. So we have our caesium under oil. We now need
to lift it up using the new device, and then drop it in the water, and let’s see what
kind of chemical reaction it does today. Everybody ready? Neil? Yep! Wow, quite a spectacular reaction. As the
caesium reacted with the water, gave away its electron, off she goes, it’s caesium
plus. Awesome, it was pretty good. Yeah, it’s pretty great you know when, when
Debbie and Neil took the caesium out of the ampoule they were really really good for us
because they gave us a really large surface area, so it could react quickly as soon as
it went in the water. Generating all that lovely hydrogen ready to explode and make
a bang. Great, good chemistry. Well, the reason that caesium reacts so violently
is that it is a very large atom, so an electron can be removed very easily, in fact if you
dissolve caesium in water, on a very short time scale, a millionth of a second or so,
it dissociates into caesium-plus and an electron, and the energy of the electron interacting
with the water is enough to separate the two and once the electron is in the water, it
then reacts with the water so that H2O dissociates into a hydrogen atom and OH-minus, so in fact
what you are making is a caesium salt which is rather like caustic soda, it’s a strong
alkali and hydrogen, and it is the rapid formation of hydrogen gas that causes part of the shock
of the reaction and then the hydrogen will usually catch fire and react with the oxygen
in the air to give you a small explosion or a big one depending how much caesium you’ve
used.

chuck it in some water and we will stand very far back when he does it. So we have got caesium, we have taken it out
of the ampoule, Neil did that the other day with Debbie in their glove box, they have
put it into a small plastic weighing boat and immersed it in oil so it can’t react
with air . Now what we need to do is a very technical operation is to punch a hole into
the plastic boat so that we can lift it out with a piece of string so we can drop it into
some water. I’ve got my friend, Dr Red. It is always good to be very very careful
when you are doing chemistry like this, just in case it goes wrong we have the safety procedures
in place for us, in case we get surprised. So now Neil is going to pass a piece of string
through the hole so that we can put it at the end of a pretty long fishing line so that
we can drop it into water. So this is Neil’s new device, it’s a very
very fancy erection. Essentially we have used a laboratory stand, and we have an eyelet
so this is just to act as a point where we can raise up our caesium on a piece of string.
At the moment, the caesium you can see is a lovely gold colour. Would you believe me,
it’s melting. Look at it. Oh yeah it’s very warm here
today and the caesium’s melted. So we are just going to try and freeze it again. Well we are going to try and refreeze the
caesium by cooling it with liquid nitrogen. Ok everybody be careful. So we have our caesium under oil. We now need
to lift it up using the new device, and then drop it in the water, and let’s see what
kind of chemical reaction it does today. Everybody ready? Neil? Yep! Wow, quite a spectacular reaction. As the
caesium reacted with the water, gave away its electron, off she goes, it’s caesium
plus. Awesome, it was pretty good. Yeah, it’s pretty great you know when, when
Debbie and Neil took the caesium out of the ampoule they were really really good for us
because they gave us a really large surface area, so it could react quickly as soon as
it went in the water. Generating all that lovely hydrogen ready to explode and make
a bang. Great, good chemistry. Well, the reason that caesium reacts so violently
is that it is a very large atom, so an electron can be removed very easily, in fact if you
dissolve caesium in water, on a very short time scale, a millionth of a second or so,
it dissociates into caesium-plus and an electron, and the energy of the electron interacting
with the water is enough to separate the two and once the electron is in the water, it
then reacts with the water so that H2O dissociates into a hydrogen atom and OH-minus, so in fact
what you are making is a caesium salt which is rather like caustic soda, it’s a strong
alkali and hydrogen, and it is the rapid formation of hydrogen gas that causes part of the shock
of the reaction and then the hydrogen will usually catch fire and react with the oxygen
in the air to give you a small explosion or a big one depending how much caesium you’ve
used.

two days ago I got an email sadly announcing the death of Neil Bartlett who is the scientist who's probably done most for the chemistry of xenon since it was first discovered at the end of the 19th century so in the balloon we've got a sample of xenon now xenon's one of the inert gases but it's one of the inert gases that's right the way down the bottom of the period so it's really really dense so what that means is that the gas molecules themselves are really really large really really heavy so in principle they'll sink Neil Bartlett discovered that Xenon which everyone had thought was a completely inert element had really could form reactions and could form compounds something that nobody thought was possible until then and this took place in the early 1960s and I've got a picture here of his iconic experiment he did his experiment I think in late 1962 and perhaps early 63 and this was published just over a year later and these are two exp pictures this is the experiment before and after so we've done an experiment here and we filled this balloon with Xenon now Xenon is very expensive so there's about 40 pounds worth of xenon in this balloon right now yeah so we're going to do this experiment and we're going to see if it sinks and I think you'll agree that it does sink quite quickly what he did was he took a glass bulb of a compound of Platinum Platinum hexafluoride ptf6 which is a gas now that's quite unusual to have a metal compound that's a gas but it's rather nice bright orange gas and he put together a piece of equipment here where in this tube here there is xenon gas which is colorless and this is a magnet which can be lifted up and break a tiny seal so that the two gases can mix but just to show you how dense it is we've got a similar balloon but you'll notice that this balloon is much much higher filled so it's much much bigger now this is one that we've just blown up with air so now what had happened was before this experiment was done with Xenon that one of Neil's students had discovered that Platinum hexafluoride reacted with oxygen in air to form a compound in which one electron had been removed from the oxygen to make O2 plus and this was a solid material it was itself quite a surprising reaction now what Neil did was that he looked at the periodic table and wondered which other elements required about the same amount of energy as oxygen to remove one electron and he came up with Xenon so he tried this experiment using the apparatus here they lifted this Magnet or he lifted this magnet it crashed down the Xenon rusting and suddenly this red gas was turned into a yellow solid in fact it turned out he was doing this experiment with his student but the student whose name I've forgotten had to go home so Neil did this experiment by himself and he was very late getting home for his dinner and his wife according to him on this video was really very angry but chemistry had been transformed well this experiment was voted by um American chemist is one of the top 10 most important chemical experiments that had been done in the 20th century so let's see if we can compare the rates at which these two balloons will sink so we can look at the comparative densities ready Xenon exists in the air and when people liquefy air they first of all separate the nitrogen and then the oxygen for and at the end they're left with the noble gases argon Krypton and Xenon so it is made from the air and one of the problems with this price rise of xenon was that at the same time as there was a bigger demand for Xenon there was a downturn in the steel making industry which uses a lot of oxygen so the chemical plants that were or the refrigeration plants that were making Xena oxygen were switched off so there was a smaller supply of xenon this is an old-fashioned Xenon lamp the Xenon in this bulb and you put a large voltage through here and the Xenon gets very hot and shines out as a very bright light um it looks black here because the electrodes get so hot that the metal has evaporated but Xenon itself is colorless this is a more modern Xenon lamp of the sort of lamp that is used in very powerful spotlights for example on tanks to illuminate that's military tanks to illuminate the Target and the window here is made of aluminum oxide and all the light comes out as a really very powerful beam

**Transcript**:
Cadmium? Yes Ok Oh yeah, that’s some! That is cool man! So cadmium is an element which is really quite
similar to mercury and the way that most people have
seen cadmium is that cadmium sulphide has a very strong orange
colour and it is therefore used for dying things yellow
or orange. If you look round your house or your parents’ house,
you may easily find a cast iron pot which has, a cooking
pot, which has nice orange sides and orange lid and this is using
cadmium sulphide as a glaze. So this is a sample which was generated or
which was used by some of our researchers in the School of
Chemistry many years ago and this is a sample of cadmium
metal. Now it’s very interesting because it is stored in this
really quite nice box which was perhaps a medication that somebody
had bought, but if we open it… It's also I believe, to colour the plastic
pipe that you see in the street for gas pipes and so on. I think
it is coloured with a cadmium compound. Now in both these applications,
even though that cadmium is quite poisonous, that
they are so strongly fixed into the materials that it
isn’t a threat to people. And we can see the lumps of the metallic cadmium.
Now I am not going to touch the cadmium because we
know of some of the issues with toxicity. But it is used very
often in batteries, or it was traditionally used in batteries.
It is really important that we dispose of our batteries in a correct
way.

**Transcript**:
Cadmium? Yes Ok Oh yeah, that’s some! That is cool man! So cadmium is an element which is really quite
similar to mercury and the way that most people have
seen cadmium is that cadmium sulphide has a very strong orange
colour and it is therefore used for dying things yellow
or orange. If you look round your house or your parents’ house,
you may easily find a cast iron pot which has, a cooking
pot, which has nice orange sides and orange lid and this is using
cadmium sulphide as a glaze. So this is a sample which was generated or
which was used by some of our researchers in the School of
Chemistry many years ago and this is a sample of cadmium
metal. Now it’s very interesting because it is stored in this
really quite nice box which was perhaps a medication that somebody
had bought, but if we open it… It's also I believe, to colour the plastic
pipe that you see in the street for gas pipes and so on. I think
it is coloured with a cadmium compound. Now in both these applications,
even though that cadmium is quite poisonous, that
they are so strongly fixed into the materials that it
isn’t a threat to people. And we can see the lumps of the metallic cadmium.
Now I am not going to touch the cadmium because we
know of some of the issues with toxicity. But it is used very
often in batteries, or it was traditionally used in batteries.
It is really important that we dispose of our batteries in a correct
way.

**Transcript**:
So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So we’re here today and we’ve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because we’re going to do something quite exciting. Because Brady’s
bought another camera which you can see he’s setup over
there and we’re going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and we’re going to do
some time lapse. Something I’ve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if you’re
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you don’t find them
naturally. So I thought what we’d do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So we’re going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. It’s a bit like a game of football.
We’re going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case it’s another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope we’ll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that you’ve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench I’ve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So we’ve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they can’t play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, I’m going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here I’ve got a sample of
silver nitrate. It’s sensitive to light so I can’t leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, I’m going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that there’s
plenty in there so that it’s saturated. Now we’ve
got to put in the competitor. So what we’re going to do, we’re
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which I’ve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all I’m going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then it’s going to start to compete for the nitrate and we’ll see what happens. So Brady’s started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now we’re going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder we’re going to make today is a
two component mixture. It’s very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neil’s just weighing the materials out right now. So we’re going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. We’re going to mix them very,
very carefully and then we’re going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one that’s made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So we’re mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here I’ve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesn’t look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that it’s
got particles in it because, if I can find a torch… So here we’ve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect that’s called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So let’s start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that they’ve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So we’re going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-B…
SQUAWCKS That’s going to come out somewhere isn’t
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If you’ve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So we’re going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time we’re going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. We’ll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasn’t returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, I’ve managed to fill maybe one minute’s
worth of time by now maybe two because we’ve been
away about two hours. So we’re going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So let’s go and have a look. There’s been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. It’s now going into the solution; it’s taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
it’s blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

one that’s made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So we’re mixing these very carefully, in
the fume hood, just in case the chemistry starts before we want
it to. And in recent times people have started making
very, very fine particles of silver, so called nanoparticles, which can exist in solutions.
So here I’ve got a solution of silver nanoparticles. You can
see it doesn’t look silver it looks a bit yellow actually and you can tell that it’s
got particles in it because, if I can find a torch… So here we’ve got
particles and you can see the particles better if we shine a light
through it and if you look at the light you can see that there is a cone of light that
looks rather like the headlights of a car in fog. And this is an
effect that’s called the Tyndall Cone which indicates that there
are very, very tiny particles suspended in the solution. So this is not silver dissolved
in the water but actually very tiny particles. So let’s start the reaction, just with a
little bit of water. Wow! I think we should do it again though. Yeah!
LAUGHTER People are now using the silver nanoparticles
for all sorts of purposes. Here you can see that they’ve
been put onto some sort of plastic and you can now buy socks which have silver nanoparticles
on them which are claimed to kill the bacteria that
make your feet smell. So we’re going to repeat the reaction. B-B-B-B…
SQUAWCKS That’s going to come out somewhere isn’t
it? Silver will conduct electricity, it will also
conduct heat. If you’ve ever tried stirring tea with a silver spoon
it gets very hot, you tend to drop it. It also conducts electricity well. So we’re going to repeat the reaction so
that you can see it again, because that was really fast. This
time we’re going to do it on a glass dish so you can see it a bit better. We’ll pour
out a small amount. LAUGHTER So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. Did you catch that? I managed to close my eyes this time(!) During the Second World War, when the US government
was involved in enriching uranium as part of
the Manhattan Project they needed an enormous amount of wire to make magnets. And so a huge
amount of silver was taken from the US treasury where it was stored as silver to give value
to the US dollar and was turned into wires to make magnets.
And I believe that the silver was never returned or at
least it wasn’t returned at the end of the war as was promised. Well, I’ve managed to fill maybe one minute’s
worth of time by now maybe two because we’ve been
away about two hours. So we’re going to go back and have a look at the flask to see
if there are any changes. If you remember when we left it was
a nice clear solution of silver nitrate with some copper
wire which was just immersed inside. So let’s go and have a look. There’s been big changes in our flask! So
if you look carefully you can see now that the copper wire
itself is covered in very, very sharp crystals of silver which have basically become deposited
on the surface. Copper has now won this chemical
reaction. It’s now going into the solution; it’s taking the salt
element and precipitating solid silver crystals. So if you look carefully, you can see that
the colour of the solution has changed. It was colourless, now
it’s blue which tells me there is another ion, copper, in the
solution.

**Transcript**:
So our reaction’s ready. Now all we need
again is a little bit of water just to start it off. So we’re here today and we’ve come back
after hours because we need to use this room for a long
period of time because we’re going to do something quite exciting. Because Brady’s
bought another camera which you can see he’s setup over
there and we’re going to use that second camera to capture
one second of film every minute for maybe two or three hours and we’re going to do
some time lapse. Something I’ve seen on TV with like flowers
opening or plants growing but never with chemistry developing. Silver is one of the few metallic elements
that occurs naturally as the metal in nature. So that if you’re
lucky you can wander around and find lumps of silver lying around on the ground. And
this is how, in ancient times, silver was discovered so it
has been known for thousands if not tens of thousands of
years. Gold is somewhat similar and also copper. But most other metals combine too easily with
oxygen or other elements so you don’t find them
naturally. So I thought what we’d do today is through
a competition reaction and that competition reaction is based
on something called the reactivity series of metals. So we’re going to compare the
reactivity of two metals. It’s a bit like a game of football.
We’re going to give one of those metals the football and in this
case it’s another component or another salt component, nitrate. So the two metals that
are going to be competing for the nitrate are silver and copper.
And really these are related by something called the
reactivity series. One of these metals is going to win, I know that and I hope we’ll
find it during this video. Silver had a particular use in photography
and in the old days when people used photographic film the
black colour that you saw on developed negatives is in fact silver. A photographic film consists
of a layer of silver bromide or sometimes silver iodide
and when the light shines on it the light just starts a tiny
amount of reaction making silver and then when you put it in the developing solution
the catalytic amount of silver that you’ve produced causes
a big reaction and you make a large amount of silver. And
so you get this black colour which then you can print as pictures. So on the bench I’ve got a small beaker
or an Erlenmeyer flask, as we chemists call it, which is full of
deionised water. So we’ve passed the water through a machine which has taken out all
of the other ions so that they can’t play around with the
competition reaction that we want to start today. Firstly, I’m going
to start off by giving the prize of the competition to silver. So here I’ve got a sample of
silver nitrate. It’s sensitive to light so I can’t leave it out
on the bench very often. So now what I want to do, I’m going to
put some into the water to make a silver nitrate solution. So I want to make sure that there’s
plenty in there so that it’s saturated. Now we’ve
got to put in the competitor. So what we’re going to do, we’re
going to take some copper, copper metal. And this is just a sample of wire which I’ve
rubbed with some wire wool just to make it sort of nice and
shiny. And now all I’m going to do is dangle it into the silver
nitrate. Then it’s going to start to compete for the nitrate and we’ll see what happens. So Brady’s started the recording and I think
the best thing for us to do is to go away and do something a
little bit more exciting and come back and have a look in an hour. Silver has become quite popular recently as
a potential new way of making things anti-bacterial: killing
bacteria. So now we’re going to make some flash powder
and the flash powder we’re going to make today is a
two component mixture. It’s very finely ground magnesium and the second component
is ground silver nitrate, solid OK. So we take these two components
and we mix the two together very intimately and
Neil’s just weighing the materials out right now. So we’re going to put the magnesium
and the silver nitrate, the two powders, together into a
small plastic container here. We’re going to mix them very,
very carefully and then we’re going to see what happens when we initiate a chemical reaction. For hundreds of years people have used silver
spoons. Partly, I think, because silver is quite easy to
make but also because the silver does have properties that kill bacteria so a silver
spoon is less likely to get harmful bacteria on it than if you have
one that’s made out of wood or horn of a cow or something
like that. So we’re mixing these very carefully, in

Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

**Transcript**:
Weston wasn't entirely mercenary and when he died in the 1820s he Beque that's left in his will samples of his Metals platinum and Palladium to the Royal Society and we still have them let's see what's in the box and here you can see there is sample that is labeled padium and if we look inside imagine that you've discovered a new element what would you do padium was discovered by the chemist Weston and this is what he did as shown by this piece of paper he made Palladium and started selling it you can see here says Palladium the new silver then down here he has the price you can buy five Shillings half a guinea which is 10 and a half Shillings or a guinea which is 21 Shillings and here he gives some of the chemical properties to conf that what it will dissolve in and so on so he starts selling it not himself he gets um a Mr forer to sell it on his behalf and forer claims he's the only person that will sell it these were discovered by won whose job was to to refine metals and he discovered a new metal and if it's your business what you do you sell it makes sense then underneath we got a letter and the letter was written a year later this was 18002 this is 183 and from somebody called chix who's Furious he thinks it's a fraud he doesn't think it's a new metal and here he's describing chemical tests that he's done which shows that Palladium is not a new metal now the problem is that wolston had not published a paper describing it so Williston got his act together and a couple of years later he wrote a paper and here we've got his original paper on the discovery of Palladium so he is now describing properly for the scientific literature what is discovered and I'm always fascinated why people choose the names for particular elements and here in these papers they actually explain why they chose the names in modern papers when they discover elements they publish the paper and then months perhaps years later they actually choose the name but here he says I subsequently that means afterwards obtained another metal to which I gave the name of Palladium from the planet that had been discovered nearly at the same time there isn't a planet as we now know with a name that sounds like Palladium but it turns out that in 18002 they discovered a very big asteroid which in those days they thought was a planet and it was called Palace this was really fashionable and trendies discover an element let's name it after the new planet and it's much the same as people do now when they discover something new they give it a name that goes with the exciting things in the time probably everybody was really excited about a new planet and this was just cashing in on that especially if you're trying to sell things but what this paper does is to show that the element was real and he described some of the reactions and he made this element by dissolving up an ore that's a rock that was containing minerals of various Noble Metals platinum and so on and by careful precipitation he could precipitate one metal after another in here got a box and inside the two lamps of metal we'll come back to these in a minute and here you can see there is sample that is labeled Palladium there are there is a two pieces of Palladium and somebody has written something on this one but what's interesting he left these samples to the Royal Society to be used for science so you can see somebody's chopped off one of these Corners must have done an experiment with it and this piece looks a very strange shape so lots of bits have probably been trimmed off it and then in here there is a inscription saying the Palladium in this packet has been rolled from fused buttons what that means is they made round pieces and then put it through rollers so out came a continuous sheet and you can see here well let's see what's inside I haven't seen it myself there are two more pieces this one is a bit strange somebody's tried to get a splinter off it there is some writing on it this one says number six and somebody else has written something else on it now what's really exciting about the samples is the letter that or the list that I've got here and this list is signed if you look down here by m Faraday one of the really great chemists and physicists who's ever lived it's a list of all the pieces of platinum and Palladium that he could find in the collection of the Royal Society what is written at the beginning is or somebody else has written weight of Palladium 74 o weight of platina that means Platinum 4 5 oz and a bit and Faraday is written out underneath I find only 28 o 420 grains of platina and 73 o and 373 grains of Palladium at this date the 11th of February 1834 so Michael Faraday is sort of saying somebody's pinched some of the Platinum nearly half in the same box as you saw there are two pieces here which are of a very dense me metal they feel very heavy which I think might be the Platinum but they're not labeled they didn't have any paper around them just a piece of plastic so I think we're going to have to get somebody to do a chemical test to tell us if these really are platinum or Palladium and what is really important that these are the samples that Michael Faraday used to do all his electrochemical experiments and so it's really like being back in his lab

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] Mark Zuckerberg a journalist was asking him a question about the newsfeed and the journalist was asking him you know why is this so important and Zuckerberg said a squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interest right now than people dying in Africa and I want to talk about what a web based on that idea of relevance might look like so when I was growing up in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

in a in a really rural area in Maine you know the internet me something very different to me it it meant uh a connection to the world it meant something that would connect us all together and I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society but there's this kind of shift in how information is Flowing online and it's invisible and if we don't pay attention to it it could be a real problem so I first noticed this uh in a place I spend a lot of time my Facebook page I'm Progressive politically big surprise but I've always uh you know gone out of my way to meet conservatives I like hearing what they're thinking about I like seeing what they link to I like learning a thing or two and so I was kind of surprised when I noticed one day that the conserv atives had disappeared from my Facebook feed and uh what it turned out was going on was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on and it was noticing that actually I was clicking more on my liberal friends links than on my conservative friends links and without consulting me about it it had edited them out they disappeared so Facebook isn't the only place that's doing this kind of invisible algorithmic editing of the web Google's doing it too if I search for something and you search for something even right now at the very same time we may get very different search results even if you're logged out one engineer told me there are 57 signals that Google looks at everything from what kind of computer you're on to what kind of browser you're using to where you're located that it uses to personally tailor your query results think about it for a second there is no standard Google anymore and you know the funny thing about this is that it's hard to see you can't see how different your search results are from anyone else's but uh a couple of weeks ago I asked a bunch of friends to Google Egypt and to send me screenshots of what they got so here's my friend uh Scott's screenshot and here's my friend Daniel's screenshot when you put them side by side you don't even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are but when you do read the links it's really quite remarkable Daniel didn't get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results Scott's results were full of them and this was the big story of the day at that time that's how different these results are becoming so it's not just Google and Facebook either you know this is uh something that's sweeping the web there are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personaliz Yahoo news the biggest news site on the Internet is now personalized different people get different things Huffington Post the Washington Post New York Times all flirting with personalization in various ways and where this this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see but not necessarily what we need to see as Eric Schmid said it'll be very hard for people to watch or cons assum something that has not in some sense been tailored for them so I do think this is a problem and uh I think if you take all of these filters together if you take all of these algorithms you get what I call a filter bubble and your filter bubble is kind of your own personal unique Universe of information that you live in online and what's in your filter bubble it depends on who you are and it depends on what you do but the thing is that you don't decide what gets in and more importantly you don't actually see what gets edited out so one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix and they were looking at the Netflix cues and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses they enter the queue they just zip right out so Iron Man Zips right out right and Waiting for Superman can wait for a really long time what they discovered was that in our Netflix cues there's kind of this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves you know we all want to be someone who has watched Rashon but right now we want to watch Ace vura for the fourth time so the best editing gives us a bit of both it gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan it gives us some information vegetables it gives us some information dessert and the challenge with these kind of algorithmic filters these personalized filters is that because they're mainly looking at what you click on first you know you don't it can throw off that balance and instead of a balanced information diet you can end up surrounded by information junk food so what this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the internet wrong in a broadcast Society you know this is how the founding mythology goes right in a broadcast Society there were these Gatekeepers the editors and they controlled the flows of information and Along Came the internet and it swept them out of the way and it allowed us all of us to connect together and it was awesome but that's not actually what's happening right now what we're seeing is more of a passing of the torch from Human Gatekeepers to algorithmic ones and the thing is that the algorithms don't yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did so if algorithms are going to curate the world for us if they're going to decide what we get to see and what we don't get to see then we need to make sure that they're not just keyed to relevance we need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important this is what Ted does right other points of view and the thing is we've actually kind of been here before as a society in 1915 it's not like newspapers uh were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities then people kind of noticed that they were doing something really important that in fact you couldn't have a functioning democracy if citizens didn't get a good flow of information that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter and that journalistic ethics developed it wasn't perfect but it got us through the last century and so now we're kind of back in 1915 on the web and we need the new Gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they're writing you know I know there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google Larry and Sergey who you know people who have helped build the web as it is and I'm grateful for that but we really need to you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life a sense of civic responsibility we need you to make sure that they're transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters and we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn't because I think we really need the internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being we need it to connect us all together we need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives and it's not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a web of one thank you thank you

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Challenge question: Dark matter gravitates. If there were less dark matter in the universe ________.
Options: A. We would expect to see fewer massive galaxy clusters, because the gravity of dark matter acts like a “glue” to keep clusters together, B. We would expect to see more galaxy clusters, because galaxy clusters would be brighter, C. We cannot directly observe dark matter, so it would make no difference, D. None of the above
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What makes up most of the universe's matter?
Options: A. Atoms, B. Dark matter, C. Dark energy, D. Plasma
Correct Option: B (Note: The correct option was incorrectly stated as "None" in the original generated MCQ. Based on the transcript, the correct answer is indeed B. Dark matter.)

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.6000 (The generated question is related to the topic of dark matter, but it doesn't directly address the same concept as the ground truth question.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer in the generated question does not match the ground truth answer, as the generated question is asking about the composition of the universe's matter, while the ground truth question is asking about the effect of less dark matter on galaxy clusters.)

**Transcript**:
Here are some images of clusters of galaxies. They're exactly what they sound like. They are these huge collections of galaxies, bound together by their mutual gravity. So most of the points that you see on the screen are not individual stars, but collections of stars, or galaxies. Now, by showing you some of these images, I hope that you will quickly see that galaxy clusters are these beautiful objects, but more than that, I think galaxy clusters are mysterious, they are surprising, and they're useful. Useful as the universe's most massive laboratories. And as laboratories, to describe galaxy clusters is to describe the experiments that you can do with them. And I think there are four major types, and the first type that I want to describe is probing the very big. So, how big? Well, here is an image of a particular galaxy cluster. It is so massive that the light passing through it is being bent, it's being distorted by the extreme gravity of this cluster. And, in fact, if you look very carefully you'll be able to see rings around this cluster. Now, to give you a number, this particular galaxy cluster has a mass of over one million billion suns. It's just mind-boggling how 
massive these systems can get. But more than their mass, they have this additional feature. They are essentially isolated systems, so if we like, we can think of them as a scaled-down version of the entire universe. And many of the questions that we might have about the universe at large scales, such as, how does gravity work? might be answered by studying these systems. So that was very big. The second things is very hot. Okay, if I take an image of a galaxy cluster, and I subtract away all of the starlight, what I'm left with is this big, blue blob. This is in false color. It's actually X-ray light that we're seeing. And the question is, if it's not galaxies, what is emitting this light? The answer is hot gas, million-degree gas -- in fact, it's plasma. And the reason why it's so hot goes back to the previous slide. The extreme gravity of these systems is accelerating particles of gas to great speeds, and great speeds means great temperatures. So this is the main idea, but science is a rough draft. There are many basic properties about this plasma that still confuse us, still puzzle us, and still push our understanding of the physics of the very hot. Third thing: probing the very small. Now, to explain this, I need to tell you a very disturbing fact. Most of the universe's matter is not made up of atoms. You were lied to. Most of it is made up of something 
very, very mysterious, which we call dark matter. Dark matter is something that 
doesn't like to interact very much, except through gravity, and of course we would like to learn more about it. If you're a particle physicist, you want to know what happens 
when we smash things together. And dark matter is no exception. Well, how do we do this? To answer that question, I'm going to have to ask another one, which is, what happens when galaxy clusters collide? Here is an image. Since galaxy clusters are representative slices of the universe, scaled-down versions. They are mostly made up of dark matter, and that's what you see in this bluish purple. The red represents the hot gas, and, of course, you can see many galaxies. What's happened is a particle accelerator at a huge, huge scale. And this is very important, because what it means is that very, very small effects that might be difficult to detect in the lab, might be compounded and compounded into something that we could 
possibly observe in nature. So, it's very funny. The reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about dark matter, the reason why galaxy clusters can teach us about the physics of the very small, is precisely because they are so very big. Fourth thing: the physics of the very strange. Certainly what I've said so far is crazy. Okay, if there's anything stranger I think it has to be dark energy. If I throw a ball into the air, I expect it to go up. What I don't expect is that it go up at an ever-increasing rate. Similarly, cosmologists understand why the universe is expanding. They don't understand why it's expanding at an ever-increasing rate. They give the cause of this accelerated expansion a name, and they call it dark energy. And, again, we want to learn more about it. So, one particular question that we have is, how does dark energy affect the universe at the largest scales? Depending on how strong it is, maybe structure forms faster or slower. Well, the problem with the large-scale structure of the universe is that it's horribly complicated. Here is a computer simulation. And we need a way to simplify it. Well, I like to think about this using an analogy. If I want to understand the sinking of the Titanic, the most important thing to do is not to model the little positions of every single little piece of the boat that broke off. The most important thing to do is to track the two biggest parts. Similarly, I can learn a lot about the universe at the largest scales by tracking its biggest pieces and those biggest pieces are clusters of galaxies. So, as I come to a close, you might feel slightly cheated. I mean, I began by talking about how galaxy clusters are useful, and I've given some reasons, but what is their use really? Well, to answer this, I want to give you a quote by Henry Ford when he was asked about cars. He had this to say: "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." Today, we as a society are faced with many, many difficult problems. And the solutions to these 
problems are not obvious. They are not faster horses. They will require an enormous amount of scientific ingenuity. So, yes, we need to focus, yes, we need to concentrate, but we also need to remember that innovation, ingenuity, inspiration -- these things come when we broaden our field of vision when we step back when we zoom out. And I can't think of a better way to do this than by studying the universe around us. Thanks. (Applause)

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Our story is about a girl named Iris. Iris is very sensitive. (Bird cawing) So much that she is always in tears. She cries when she's sad, when she's happy, (Godzilla roars) and even tears up
when things just get to her. She has special lacrimal glands
to make new tears and special tubes, called lacrimal puncta, to drain old ones away. And she cries so much
that she goes through ten ounces of tears per day, thirty gallons a year! In fact, if you look closely, you'll see that she's crying
a little bit all the time. The basal tears that Iris
constantly produces form a thin coating of three layers that cover her and keep
dirt and debris away. Right next to Iris is the mucus layer, which keeps the whole
thing fastened to her. On top of it is the aqueous layer, which keeps Iris hydrated,
repels invasive bacteria, and protects her skin,
or cornea, from damage. And, finally, there is the lipid layer, an oily outer film that keeps
the surface smooth for Iris to see through, and prevents the other
layers from evaporating. Normally, Iris goes about her day without really noticing
the basal tears doing their thing. That's kind of their whole point. But one day, she meets a girl named Onion. Iris is immediately smitten. Onion looks gorgeous in her
bright purple jacket, and she smells terrific. So, Iris invites Onion
to her house for dinner. But when she comes in
and takes off her jacket, something terrible happens. You see, when Onion's jacket is removed, a chemical reaction happens, converting the sulfoxides
that make her smell so great into sulfenic acid, which then becomes a nasty
substance with a long name: syn-Propanethial S-oxide. The gas stings Iris,
and suddenly, she can't help it, she starts weeping uncontrollably. These reflex tears are different
from the basal tears that Iris is used to. Because they're designed to wash away harmful
substances, or particles, they're released in much larger amounts, and their aqueous layer
contains more antibodies to stop any microorganisms
that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.

that may be trying to get in, as well. Both Iris and Onion are devastated. They know they can't continue
their relationship if Iris is going to hurt and cry
every time Onion takes off her jacket. So, they decide to break up. As Onion walks out the door,
Iris stops crying. And immediately starts again. Only now, she's not crying
reflex tears but emotional tears. When someone is either
too sad or too happy, it feels like a loss of control, which can be dangerous. So, emotional tears are sent in
to stabilize the mood as quickly as possible, along with other physical reactions, such as an increased heart rate
and slower breathing. But scientists still aren't sure exactly how or why the tears
themselves are helpful. They may be a social mechanism
to elicit sympathy or show submission. But some studies have also found that emotional tears contain
higher levels of stress hormones, such as ACTH and enkephalin, an endorphin and natural pain killer. In this case, emotional tears
are also directly calming Iris down, as well as signaling
her emotional state to others. Sorry things didn't work out
with Onion, Iris, but don't worry. As long as you have
all three kinds of tears working to keep you balanced
and healthy, it will get better. You'll see.
