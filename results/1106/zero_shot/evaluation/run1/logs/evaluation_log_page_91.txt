Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask who funded Dr. Ballard's mission, one of its options (C) mentions that the US Navy "had other priorities, such as finding lost nuclear submarines." This option implies that the US Navy was involved in the mission, which aligns with the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ (B. The U.S. Navy). 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Question 2 is the closest match, but it still requires some inference to connect it to the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You breathe in about 17,000 times per day. It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated
effort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen
to tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients
of aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces
a molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their
many incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our
bodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in
from their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently
over tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells
within our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion 
red blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million
oxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses
raw materials that become available from
the food we eat. So in some ways, you could say
that oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical
and chemical digestion, food gets broken down into
its smallest elements, like iron, the building block
of hemoglobin. Iron is carried through 
the cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace 
of red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within
our bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate 
our levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow
to increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million
red blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire
population of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs
will have ample transportation. But before oxygen 
can even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message
through your nervous system, all the way to muscles 
of the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space
inside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs
internal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs
as two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more 
complicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels
within your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules
that are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact
with the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures
that very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into
hundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections
called alveoli that dramatically increase 
the contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of
extremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and
capillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough
for diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then
carried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels
that reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out
end to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth
several times. Propelling red blood cells
through this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average
of about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately
gets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system
is built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned,
so would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones, 
lungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act
of coordination that keeps you alive. Breathe out.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question content, options, and overall intent, the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the surface area of the lungs, which is not mentioned in any of the generated MCQs.

However, if we look at the content of the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the closest in terms of relevance to the lungs, but it does not ask about the surface area.

Therefore, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
You breathe in about 17,000 times per day. It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated
effort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen
to tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients
of aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces
a molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their
many incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our
bodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in
from their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently
over tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells
within our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion 
red blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million
oxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses
raw materials that become available from
the food we eat. So in some ways, you could say
that oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical
and chemical digestion, food gets broken down into
its smallest elements, like iron, the building block
of hemoglobin. Iron is carried through 
the cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace 
of red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within
our bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate 
our levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow
to increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million
red blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire
population of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs
will have ample transportation. But before oxygen 
can even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message
through your nervous system, all the way to muscles 
of the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space
inside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs
internal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs
as two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more 
complicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels
within your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules
that are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact
with the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures
that very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into
hundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections
called alveoli that dramatically increase 
the contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of
extremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and
capillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough
for diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then
carried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels
that reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out
end to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth
several times. Propelling red blood cells
through this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average
of about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately
gets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system
is built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned,
so would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones, 
lungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act
of coordination that keeps you alive. Breathe out.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the necessary systems for oxygen to reach the cells of the body. The closest generated MCQ in terms of relevance is Question 8, which asks about the function of the alveoli in the lungs. However, this question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but it's still not a good match. A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (with the caveat that it's still not a good match)

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Why do we buy certain products
or choose certain brands? This is the sort of question advertisers
have always asked, and there are no easy answers. However, there is a handy tool
that helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group. Until the 1940s, market research
was often quantitative using things like sales figures
and customer polls to track consumption. But this changed during World War II. Sociologists Robert Merton
and Paul Lazarsfeld set out to learn how unprecedented
exposure to wartime propaganda was affecting the public. Instead of polling large numbers of people with straightforward questions
and quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted 
in-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions. Later, this method was picked up
by the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist
Ernest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group. This new technique was a type
of qualitative research focused on the nature 
of people's preferences and thoughts. It couldn't tell marketers what percentage
of people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about
the people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations
behind those reasons. Rather than providing definite conclusions
for business and sales, focus groups would be used
for exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper
understanding of consumer habits. For example, early focus groups found that
contrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their
husbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing
cars directly to women. And Dr. Dichter himself conducted
focus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll. The result was the original Barbie doll. So how does a focus group work? First, companies recruit between
six and ten participants according to specific criteria
that meet their research objectives. They could be mothers of children
between five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy
a new phone in the next three months. This is often done through professional
recruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in
focus groups for payment or other rewards. During a session, participants are asked
to respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions
on a certain product, or their emotional reactions
to an advertisement. They may even be asked to do
seemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo. The idea is that this can reveal 
useful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions 
might not get to. Beyond these basics,
many variations are possible. A focus group may have two
or more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides
on a question, or a researcher might be hidden
in the focus group unknown to other participants to see
how their answers can be influenced. And the whole process may also
be observed by researchers through a one-way mirror. But although they can provide
valuable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that
the simple act of observing something can change it. This principle is called 
observer interference. The answers participants give are likely to be affected 
by the presence of the researchers, social pressure 
from the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking
part in a focus group. And because researchers often use
a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. The findings that researchers do reach
from focus groups are often tested through experiments
and data gathering. Those put numbers on questions like
how many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay. This part of the process changes
as technology evolves. But focus groups have remained
largely the same for decades. Perhaps when it comes
to the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people
genuinely interacting with each other.

**Transcript**:
Why do we buy certain products
or choose certain brands? This is the sort of question advertisers
have always asked, and there are no easy answers. However, there is a handy tool
that helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group. Until the 1940s, market research
was often quantitative using things like sales figures
and customer polls to track consumption. But this changed during World War II. Sociologists Robert Merton
and Paul Lazarsfeld set out to learn how unprecedented
exposure to wartime propaganda was affecting the public. Instead of polling large numbers of people with straightforward questions
and quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted 
in-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions. Later, this method was picked up
by the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist
Ernest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group. This new technique was a type
of qualitative research focused on the nature 
of people's preferences and thoughts. It couldn't tell marketers what percentage
of people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about
the people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations
behind those reasons. Rather than providing definite conclusions
for business and sales, focus groups would be used
for exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper
understanding of consumer habits. For example, early focus groups found that
contrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their
husbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing
cars directly to women. And Dr. Dichter himself conducted
focus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll. The result was the original Barbie doll. So how does a focus group work? First, companies recruit between
six and ten participants according to specific criteria
that meet their research objectives. They could be mothers of children
between five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy
a new phone in the next three months. This is often done through professional
recruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in
focus groups for payment or other rewards. During a session, participants are asked
to respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions
on a certain product, or their emotional reactions
to an advertisement. They may even be asked to do
seemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo. The idea is that this can reveal 
useful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions 
might not get to. Beyond these basics,
many variations are possible. A focus group may have two
or more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides
on a question, or a researcher might be hidden
in the focus group unknown to other participants to see
how their answers can be influenced. And the whole process may also
be observed by researchers through a one-way mirror. But although they can provide
valuable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that
the simple act of observing something can change it. This principle is called 
observer interference. The answers participants give are likely to be affected 
by the presence of the researchers, social pressure 
from the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking
part in a focus group. And because researchers often use
a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. The findings that researchers do reach
from focus groups are often tested through experiments
and data gathering. Those put numbers on questions like
how many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay. This part of the process changes
as technology evolves. But focus groups have remained
largely the same for decades. Perhaps when it comes
to the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people
genuinely interacting with each other.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ is about how researchers observe the focus group. While there isn't a direct match, Question 5 mentions the role of the group moderator, and Question 7 mentions observer interference.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that could be modified to match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6: What is the principle called when the act of observing something changes it? Options: A. Observer effect, B. Observer interference, C. Social pressure, D. Groupthink.

This question could be modified to ask about how researchers observe the focus group, and option B (Observer interference) could be replaced with "One-way mirror" to match the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will not provide an index. However, I suggest generating new MCQs that directly match the ground truth MCQs or modifying existing MCQs to match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQs.

**Transcript**:
When French mathematician Laurent Schwartz
was in high school, he started to worry that he wasn't
smart enough to solve math problems. Maybe you know a similar feeling. You sit down to take a math test, and you feel your heart beat faster and your palms start to sweat. You get butterflies in your stomach,
and you can't concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you,
you're not alone. Researchers think about 20% 
of the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it
a diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn't
necessarily mean you're bad at math - not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win
the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they're anxious
about math because they're bad at it, but it's often the other way around. They're doing poorly in math
because they're anxious about it. Some psychologists think that's because math anxiety decreases 
a cognitive resource called working memory. That's the short-term memory system that helps you organize the information 
you need to complete a task. Worrying about being able to solve
math problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle
the math itself. People can suddenly struggle
with even basic math skills, like arithmetic, 
that they've otherwise mastered. Academic anxiety certainly
isn't limited to math, but it does seem to happen much
more frequently, and cause more harm
in that subject. So why would that be? Researchers aren't yet sure, but some studies suggest that the way children are exposed
to math by their parents and teachers play a large part. If parents talk about math like
something challenging and unfamiliar, children can internalize that. Teachers with math anxiety are also
likely to spread it to their students. Pressure to solve problems quickly
dials up stress even more. And in some cultures, being good
at math is a sign of being smart in general. When the stakes are that high, it's not surprising 
that students are anxious. Even Maryam Mirzakhani, 
an influential mathematician who was the first woman to win
the Fields Medal, felt unconfident and lost interest
in mathematics because her math teacher in middle school
didn't think she was talented. So if you experience mathematical anxiety, what can you do? Relaxation techniques, 
like short breathing exercises, have improved test performance
in students with math anxiety. Writing down your worries can also help. This strategy may give you a chance
to reevaluate a stressful experience, freeing up working memory. And if you have the chance, physical activity, like a brisk walk,
deepens breathing and helps relieve muscle tension, preventing anxiety from building. You can also use your knowledge
about the brain to change your mindset. The brain is flexible, and the areas involved in math skills 
can always grow and develop. This is a psychological principle
called the growth mindset. Thinking of yourself as someone
who can grow and improve can actually help you grow and improve. If you're a teacher 
or parent of young children, try being playful with math
and focusing on the creative aspects. That can build the numerical skills that help students approach math 
with confidence later on. Importantly, you should give children
the time and space to work through their answers. And if you're an administrator, make sure your teachers 
have the positive attitudes and mathematical confidence necessary to inspire confidence 
in all of their students. Also, don't let anyone spread the myth that boys are innately 
better than girls at math. That is completely false. If you experience math anxiety, it may not help to just know 
that math anxiety exists. Or perhaps it's reassuring to put
a name to the problem. Regardless, if you take a look
around yourself, the odds are good that you'll see someone 
experiencing the same thing as you. Just remember that the anxiety is not
a reflection of your ability, but it is something you can conquer 
with time and awareness.

math problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle
the math itself. People can suddenly struggle
with even basic math skills, like arithmetic, 
that they've otherwise mastered. Academic anxiety certainly
isn't limited to math, but it does seem to happen much
more frequently, and cause more harm
in that subject. So why would that be? Researchers aren't yet sure, but some studies suggest that the way children are exposed
to math by their parents and teachers play a large part. If parents talk about math like
something challenging and unfamiliar, children can internalize that. Teachers with math anxiety are also
likely to spread it to their students. Pressure to solve problems quickly
dials up stress even more. And in some cultures, being good
at math is a sign of being smart in general. When the stakes are that high, it's not surprising 
that students are anxious. Even Maryam Mirzakhani, 
an influential mathematician who was the first woman to win
the Fields Medal, felt unconfident and lost interest
in mathematics because her math teacher in middle school
didn't think she was talented. So if you experience mathematical anxiety, what can you do? Relaxation techniques, 
like short breathing exercises, have improved test performance
in students with math anxiety. Writing down your worries can also help. This strategy may give you a chance
to reevaluate a stressful experience, freeing up working memory. And if you have the chance, physical activity, like a brisk walk,
deepens breathing and helps relieve muscle tension, preventing anxiety from building. You can also use your knowledge
about the brain to change your mindset. The brain is flexible, and the areas involved in math skills 
can always grow and develop. This is a psychological principle
called the growth mindset. Thinking of yourself as someone
who can grow and improve can actually help you grow and improve. If you're a teacher 
or parent of young children, try being playful with math
and focusing on the creative aspects. That can build the numerical skills that help students approach math 
with confidence later on. Importantly, you should give children
the time and space to work through their answers. And if you're an administrator, make sure your teachers 
have the positive attitudes and mathematical confidence necessary to inspire confidence 
in all of their students. Also, don't let anyone spread the myth that boys are innately 
better than girls at math. That is completely false. If you experience math anxiety, it may not help to just know 
that math anxiety exists. Or perhaps it's reassuring to put
a name to the problem. Regardless, if you take a look
around yourself, the odds are good that you'll see someone 
experiencing the same thing as you. Just remember that the anxiety is not
a reflection of your ability, but it is something you can conquer 
with time and awareness.

**Transcript**:
When French mathematician Laurent Schwartz
was in high school, he started to worry that he wasn't
smart enough to solve math problems. Maybe you know a similar feeling. You sit down to take a math test, and you feel your heart beat faster and your palms start to sweat. You get butterflies in your stomach,
and you can't concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you,
you're not alone. Researchers think about 20% 
of the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it
a diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn't
necessarily mean you're bad at math - not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win
the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they're anxious
about math because they're bad at it, but it's often the other way around. They're doing poorly in math
because they're anxious about it. Some psychologists think that's because math anxiety decreases

**Transcript**:
Muhammad Ali spent years training
to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create
the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's 
graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, 
the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered
the shortest poem ever. "Me, we." Or is it "me, weeee"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,
then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled
with this question, often using metaphors to approximate
a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain
recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's
musical qualities. This can be achieved through
rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water
wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature
intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Onion." Poetry, like art itself, has a way
of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" toe the line between visual art
and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems
whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness
of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry
faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people
love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets
in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,
rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. "I can hear sweat trickling 
down your cheek Your heartbeat sound 
like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete." So far, all the examples we've seen
have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words
of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti. "Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing." Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began
in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed
100% of the time.

of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" toe the line between visual art
and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems
whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness
of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry
faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people
love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets
in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,
rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. "I can hear sweat trickling 
down your cheek Your heartbeat sound 
like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete." So far, all the examples we've seen
have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words
of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti. "Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing." Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began
in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: Which poets' works are mentioned as examples of poetry that challenge simple definitions?**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent of the question is similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about examples that challenge traditional concepts of poetry, while Question 3 asks about poets whose works challenge simple definitions of poetry. The options in Question 3 also mention poets whose works are discussed in the transcript as examples of poetry that challenge traditional concepts.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about examples that challenge traditional concepts of poetry, specifically mentioning "visual art, debates, speeches, and songs" as options.

Considering the options and content, I would argue that a more suitable match is not present among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one, I would select:

**Question 3**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that specifically asks about examples that challenge traditional concepts of poetry, with options that include "visual art, debates, speeches, and songs."

Muhammad Ali spent years training
to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create
the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's 
graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, 
the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered
the shortest poem ever. "Me, we." Or is it "me, weeee"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,
then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled
with this question, often using metaphors to approximate
a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain
recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's
musical qualities. This can be achieved through
rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water
wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature
intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Onion." Poetry, like art itself, has a way
of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" toe the line between visual art

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: Who tweeted updates from the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, using language that was powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Both questions relate to Joanna Smith's tweet and its poetic qualities. However, the ground truth MCQ asks about the specific way in which Smith's tweet was like a poem, whereas Question 6 asks about the person who tweeted.

A more ideal match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the poetic qualities of Smith's tweet, but such a question is not present in the provided set. Therefore, I recommend Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Muhammad Ali spent years training
to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create
the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's 
graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, 
the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered
the shortest poem ever. "Me, we." Or is it "me, weeee"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,
then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled
with this question, often using metaphors to approximate
a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain
recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's
musical qualities. This can be achieved through
rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water
wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature
intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Onion." Poetry, like art itself, has a way
of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" toe the line between visual art
and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems
whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness
of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry
faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people
love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets
in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,
rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. "I can hear sweat trickling 
down your cheek Your heartbeat sound 
like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete." So far, all the examples we've seen
have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words
of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti. "Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing." Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began
in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed
100% of the time.

**Transcript**:
If you can't imagine
life without chocolate, you're lucky you weren't born before
the 16th century. Until then, chocolate only existed
in Mesoamerica in a form quite different 
from what we know. As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground and mixed with cornmeal
and chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction
frothing with foam. And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat. They believed that cacao
was a heavenly food gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward
for success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic
chocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited
the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink
brought out and poured into golden cups. When the colonists returned with shipments
of the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts
of native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac. At first, its bitter taste made it
suitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey,
sugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy
in the Spanish court. And soon, no aristocratic home was
complete without dedicated chocolate ware. The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce on a large scale. That involved using plantations
and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa. The world of chocolate would change
forever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press
by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate
we know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required
more cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator. Now, instead of African slaves 
being shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015. Yet along with the growth
of the industry, there have been horrific abuses
of human rights. Many of the plantations throughout
West Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected. This is a complex problem
that persists despite efforts from major chocolate
companies to partner with African nations to reduce child 
and indentured labor practices. Today, chocolate has established itself
in the rituals of our modern culture. Due to its colonial association with
native cultures, combined with the power of advertising, chocolate retains an aura
of something sensual, decadent, and forbidden. Yet knowing more about its fascinating
and often cruel history, as well as its production today, tells us where 
these associations originate and what they hide. So as you unwrap 
your next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that
not everything about chocolate is sweet.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the topic of European exploration and encounter with chocolate, the closest match can be found in the transcript.

A potential match could be related to the first transatlantic chocolate encounter, which involved Hernán Cortés visiting the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. Although this does not directly answer the ground truth MCQ, it provides information about the European country that first encountered chocolate.

Since Hernán Cortés was from Spain, Question 4 is the closest match, as it mentions the year Cortés visited the court of Moctezuma. However, it does not explicitly ask about the European country.

by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate
we know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required
more cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator. Now, instead of African slaves 
being shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015. Yet along with the growth
of the industry, there have been horrific abuses
of human rights. Many of the plantations throughout
West Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected. This is a complex problem
that persists despite efforts from major chocolate
companies to partner with African nations to reduce child 
and indentured labor practices. Today, chocolate has established itself
in the rituals of our modern culture. Due to its colonial association with
native cultures, combined with the power of advertising, chocolate retains an aura
of something sensual, decadent, and forbidden. Yet knowing more about its fascinating
and often cruel history, as well as its production today, tells us where 
these associations originate and what they hide. So as you unwrap 
your next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that
not everything about chocolate is sweet.

**Transcript**:
If you can't imagine
life without chocolate, you're lucky you weren't born before
the 16th century. Until then, chocolate only existed
in Mesoamerica in a form quite different 
from what we know. As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground and mixed with cornmeal
and chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction
frothing with foam. And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat. They believed that cacao
was a heavenly food gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward
for success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic
chocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited
the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink
brought out and poured into golden cups. When the colonists returned with shipments
of the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts
of native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac. At first, its bitter taste made it
suitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey,
sugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy
in the Spanish court. And soon, no aristocratic home was
complete without dedicated chocolate ware. The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce on a large scale. That involved using plantations
and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa. The world of chocolate would change
forever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press
by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate
we know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required

Imagine that one day,
you're summoned before a government panel. Even though you haven't 
committed any crime, or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned
about your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends
and associates. If you don't cooperate,
you risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in
the United States in the 1950s as part of a campaign to expose
suspected communists. Named after its most 
notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism
destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political 
leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small
communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider 
progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American 
Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized
its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. During World War II, when the USA
and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually
spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated
and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen
as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest lasting
and most widespread episode of political repression 
in American history. Spurred on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated
the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding 
left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against
nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Starting in the late 1940s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency
to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any
position of influence within American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover
and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public
and private employers were imposing the same political tests
on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted 
its own witchhunt subpoenaing hundreds of people
to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American 
Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate,
they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly, fired and blacklisted. Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, used such hearings as a partisan weapon accusing democrats 
of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China
to the Communist Bloc. McCarthy, a Republican senator 
from Wisconsin became notorious by flaunting
ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Egged on by other politicians, he continued to make 
outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy
while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out,
McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee
on investigations in 1953, McCarthy recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that 
finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues 
in the Senate censured him and he died less than three years later,
probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds, 
if not thousands, of lives and drastically narrowed the American
political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions
would be long lasting. In all likelihood, there were both
Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist
purges were deeply unjust but feared that directly opposing them
would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed
to stop the witchhunt, condoning serious violations
of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual
threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme
that it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared
in uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities
in the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses the duration or impact of McCarthyism.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 mentions the outcome for Joseph McCarthy after his colleagues in the Senate censured him, which includes the fact that he died less than three years later. This implies a time frame but does not directly address the duration of McCarthyism.

However, Question 7 mentions the impact of McCarthyism on the American political spectrum, stating that it "narrowed the spectrum." While this does not directly answer the ground truth MCQ about the duration of McCarthyism, the transcript does mention that McCarthyism "lasted for over a decade" in the context of its impact on American politics and society.

Given the available options, I would argue that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it indirectly relates to the time frame of McCarthyism by discussing its long-term impact.

**Transcript**:
Imagine that one day,
you're summoned before a government panel. Even though you haven't 
committed any crime, or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned
about your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends
and associates. If you don't cooperate,
you risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in
the United States in the 1950s as part of a campaign to expose
suspected communists. Named after its most 
notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism
destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political 
leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small
communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider 
progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American 
Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized
its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. During World War II, when the USA
and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually
spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated
and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen
as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest lasting
and most widespread episode of political repression 
in American history. Spurred on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated
the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding 
left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against
nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Starting in the late 1940s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency
to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any
position of influence within American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover
and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public
and private employers were imposing the same political tests
on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted 
its own witchhunt subpoenaing hundreds of people
to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American 
Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate,
they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly, fired and blacklisted. Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, used such hearings as a partisan weapon accusing democrats 
of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China
to the Communist Bloc. McCarthy, a Republican senator 
from Wisconsin became notorious by flaunting
ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Egged on by other politicians, he continued to make 
outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy
while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out,
McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee
on investigations in 1953, McCarthy recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that 
finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues 
in the Senate censured him and he died less than three years later,
probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds, 
if not thousands, of lives and drastically narrowed the American
political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions
would be long lasting. In all likelihood, there were both
Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist
purges were deeply unjust but feared that directly opposing them
would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed
to stop the witchhunt, condoning serious violations
of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual
threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme
that it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared
in uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities
in the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the consequences of failing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, which mentions the House Un-American Activities Committee but does not ask about the consequences of failing to testify.

However, a closer look at the generated MCQs reveals that Question 8 is about the Supreme Court's response to the anti-communist purges, and it mentions the condoning of serious violations of constitutional rights. While it does not directly ask about the consequences of failing to testify, it does touch on the topic of the witchhunt and the violations of constitutional rights.

But the most similar question in terms of the consequences is actually not present among the generated MCQs. However, in terms of the topic, the closest match would be Question 3.

**Transcript**:
Dating back at least 
to the time of Socrates, some early societies decided
that certain disputes, such as whether a person committed
a particular crime, should be heard by a group of citizens. Several centuries later, trial by jury
was introduced to England, where it became a fundamental feature
of the legal system, checking the government 
and involving citizens in decision-making. Juries decided whether defendants
would be tried on crimes, determined whether the accused
defendants were guilty, and resolved monetary disputes. While the American colonies eventually
cast off England's rule, its legal tradition of the jury persisted. The United States Constitution 
instructed a grand jury to decide whether 
criminal cases proceeded, required a jury to try all crimes,
except impeachment, and provided for juries 
in civil cases as well. Yet, in the US today,
grand juries often are not convened, and juries decide less than 4%
of criminal cases and less than 1% of civil cases
filed in court. That's at the same time as jury systems
in other countries are growing. So what happened in the U.S.? Part of the story lies in how the Supreme
Court has interpreted the Constitution. It's permitted plea bargaining, which now occurs in almost 
every criminal case. The way it works is the prosecutor
presents the accused with a decision of whether 
to plead guilty. If they accept the plea, the case won't
go in front of a jury, but they'll receive 
a shorter prison sentence than they'd get if 
a jury did convict them. The risk of a much greater 
prison sentence after a trial can frighten even an innocent defendant
into taking a plea. Between the 19th century 
and the 21st century, the proportion of guilty pleas
has increased from around 20% to 90%, and the numbers continue to grow. The Supreme Court has permitted
the use of another procedure that interferes with the jury called summary judgement. Using summary judgement, judges can
decide that civil trials are unnecessary if the people who sue 
have insufficient evidence. This is intended only for cases
where no reasonable jury would disagree. That's a difficult thing 
to determine, yet usage of summary judgement
has stretched to the point where some would argue it's being abused. For instance, judges grant fully,
or in part, over 70% of employers' requests to dismiss employment 
discrimination cases. In other cases, both the person who sues
and the person who defends forgo their right to go to court, instead resolving their dispute through
a professional arbitrator. These are generally lawyers, professors,
or former judges. Arbitration can be a smart decision
by both parties to avoid the requirements 
of a trial in court, but it's often agreed to unwittingly
when people sign contracts like employment applications
and consumer agreements. That can become a problem. For example, some arbitrators 
may be biased towards the companies
that give them cases. These are just some of the ways
in which juries have disappeared. But could the disappearance of juries
be a good thing? Well, juries aren't perfect. They're costly, time-consuming, and may make errors. And they're not always necessary, like when people can simply agree
to settle their disputes. But juries have their advantages. When properly selected, jurors are more representative of
the general population and don't have the same incentives
as prosecutors, legislators, or judges seeking reelection or promotion. The founders of the United States trusted
in the wisdom of impartial groups of citizens to check the power of all three branches
of government. And the jury trial itself has given
ordinary citizens a central role in upholding
the social fabric. So will the jury system in the U.S.
survive into the future?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, the options and the question content do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about the percentage of cases that involve plea bargaining, not the percentage of cases decided by juries. However, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If we consider the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to ask about the prevalence of plea bargaining in criminal cases, we can find a related question among the generated MCQs.

Question 5 asks about the result of accepting a plea bargain, which is related to the concept of plea bargaining. However, it does not ask about the percentage of cases that involve plea bargaining.

Considering the available options, the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of discussing percentages, and Question 5 is the closest in terms of discussing plea bargaining.

However, if we must choose one index, I would suggest Question 5 (index 5) as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is more closely related to the concept of plea bargaining, even though it does not ask about the percentage of cases.

Please note that this is an approximation, as there is no exact match among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Dating back at least 
to the time of Socrates, some early societies decided
that certain disputes, such as whether a person committed
a particular crime, should be heard by a group of citizens. Several centuries later, trial by jury
was introduced to England, where it became a fundamental feature
of the legal system, checking the government 
and involving citizens in decision-making. Juries decided whether defendants
would be tried on crimes, determined whether the accused
defendants were guilty, and resolved monetary disputes. While the American colonies eventually
cast off England's rule, its legal tradition of the jury persisted. The United States Constitution 
instructed a grand jury to decide whether 
criminal cases proceeded, required a jury to try all crimes,
except impeachment, and provided for juries 
in civil cases as well. Yet, in the US today,
grand juries often are not convened, and juries decide less than 4%
of criminal cases and less than 1% of civil cases
filed in court. That's at the same time as jury systems
in other countries are growing. So what happened in the U.S.? Part of the story lies in how the Supreme
Court has interpreted the Constitution. It's permitted plea bargaining, which now occurs in almost 
every criminal case. The way it works is the prosecutor
presents the accused with a decision of whether 
to plead guilty. If they accept the plea, the case won't
go in front of a jury, but they'll receive 
a shorter prison sentence than they'd get if 
a jury did convict them. The risk of a much greater 
prison sentence after a trial can frighten even an innocent defendant
into taking a plea. Between the 19th century 
and the 21st century, the proportion of guilty pleas
has increased from around 20% to 90%, and the numbers continue to grow. The Supreme Court has permitted
the use of another procedure that interferes with the jury called summary judgement. Using summary judgement, judges can
decide that civil trials are unnecessary if the people who sue 
have insufficient evidence. This is intended only for cases
where no reasonable jury would disagree. That's a difficult thing 
to determine, yet usage of summary judgement
has stretched to the point where some would argue it's being abused. For instance, judges grant fully,
or in part, over 70% of employers' requests to dismiss employment 
discrimination cases. In other cases, both the person who sues
and the person who defends forgo their right to go to court, instead resolving their dispute through
a professional arbitrator. These are generally lawyers, professors,
or former judges. Arbitration can be a smart decision
by both parties to avoid the requirements 
of a trial in court, but it's often agreed to unwittingly
when people sign contracts like employment applications
and consumer agreements. That can become a problem. For example, some arbitrators 
may be biased towards the companies
that give them cases. These are just some of the ways
in which juries have disappeared. But could the disappearance of juries
be a good thing? Well, juries aren't perfect. They're costly, time-consuming, and may make errors. And they're not always necessary, like when people can simply agree
to settle their disputes. But juries have their advantages. When properly selected, jurors are more representative of
the general population and don't have the same incentives
as prosecutors, legislators, or judges seeking reelection or promotion. The founders of the United States trusted
in the wisdom of impartial groups of citizens to check the power of all three branches
of government. And the jury trial itself has given
ordinary citizens a central role in upholding
the social fabric. So will the jury system in the U.S.
survive into the future?

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the result for a defendant who accepts a plea bargain? Options: A. A longer prison sentence, B. A shorter prison sentence, C. A trial by jury, D. A dismissal of the case.

However, the correct answer in the generated MCQ is B, which only partially matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that explicitly asks why a defendant would plead guilty in a plea bargaining arrangement.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4: What is the primary reason for the decline of jury trials in the US, according to the Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution? Options: A. The use of summary judgement, B. The use of arbitration, C. The permission of plea bargaining, D. The lack of citizen participation, is related to the topic of plea bargaining, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match, although it is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
[PBSDS BUMPER] The average person gets rid of approximately 130 grams of poop every day. Maybe twice that much if they’ve had Taco
Bell. Seven and a half billion of us on Earth? That’s a literal mountain of human poop
every day. Yet most of *us* get to pretend it doesn’t
exist, all thanks to an invention that has improved health and quality of life more than
any other in humanity’s history. [OPEN BUMPER] Bears do it in the woods, whales do it in the ocean, and 2.4 *billion* of us DON’T
do it in a toilet. Dysentery, typhoid, parasites, and other infections
lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, all because one in three people alive
in 2017 don’t have access to toilets and latrines. From on top of our porcelain thrones, we’ve
left a lot of our species drowning in feces. Nearly a *billion* people still defecate out
in the open: in street gutters, open water, or… in the woods. Thousands of years ago, we all did it that
way, but as we developed agriculture and settled into towns, poop started piling up. Around five thousand years ago, Neolithic
villagers constructed the first known toilets at Skara Brae. At the same time, many houses in Mohenjo Daro,
featured toilets complete with drains, people washed their poop into sewers that emptied
into the Indus River. It’d be thousands of years before we linked
germs to disease, but avoiding filth has deep evolutionary roots. Bodily excretions, death, and rotten smells
can be signs of danger or disease, triggering our innate sense of disgust. This biological instinct ended up in the moral
codes of many religions, like this passage from the Old Testament instructing the Hebrews
to do their Exodus in a… hole-y fashion. Roman society was comfortable with caca. At one point, Rome had 144 public toilets…
long open benches that emptied into the Cloaca Maxima, a sewer system that carried waste
to the Tiber river. But the vast majority of Romans simply pooped
in a pot and threw it into the street. As waste and disease piled up, Romans pointed
to the stink as the cause of sickness. After the Roman Empire faded away, this connection
between bad air and bad health persisted, clogging up toilet innovation for more than
a thousand years. During medieval outbreaks like the Plague,
doctors wore pointed masks, filled with strong herbs or perfumes to “cleanse” bad air,
which they believed to be the cause of disease. They were wrong, but this obsession with stink
would change the world in ways no one saw coming. Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper
didn’t invent the flush toilet. That honor goes to John Harington, his “Ajax”
device emptied the bowl with water from an overhead tank. But flush toilets didn’t catch on until
1775, when Alexander Cummings revolutionized the way we poo by adding a water-filled “S
trap” to block explosive, and supposedly disease-causing sewer gas from rising up the
pipes, the same basic toilet design we still use today. During the Industrial Revolution, most people’s
business still ended up in streets and cesspools, and the growing population was too big a load
for London’s sewers. By the mid-1800s, the city was literally overflowing
with crap. With crap comes cholera, an infection from
bacteria whose toxins basically cause all the water in your body to pour out of your
butt in the form of diarrhea, death by dehydration. Cholera hit London in 1854. Instead of the “old bad air” theory, a
doctor named John Snow believed cholera was transmitted by drinking water tainted with
sewage. Snow’s map of cholera cases clustered around
a water pump. When he when he removed the pump’s handle,
new cholera cases fell. Soon after, London enclosed its sewers and
diverted waste downstream of London, but doctors wouldn’t totally accept Snow’s ideas for
nearly 50 years. The Great Depression saw an expansion of sewage
treatment plants–and modern toilet paper!–and this is basically the sanitation system we
have today, where magical chairs make nasty things disappear, out of sight, out of smell,
and out of mind. It’s no three sea shells but we've come a long way. …and this privileged pooping existence lets
us keep something else out of mind: The 2.4 BILLION people who still don’t have toilets. Nearly 800,000 children under 5 still die
every year from diarrhea. More than AIDS, more than malaria. That’s an Airbus A380 full of children crashing
every 6 hours. It’s estimated last year poor sanitation
cost the global economy $260 billion, due to illness, loss of income, and years of life
lost. Worse, women suffer these impacts disproportionately
to men. In 2007, readers of the BMJ voted “modern
sanitation” as the #1 medical advance since 1840. Not antibiotics, not vaccines. Toilets and clean water. We *have* made progress. Since 1990, 14% more people have access to
sanitation, and *many* fewer are dying, but fewer is not zero. With a little effort, we can *wipe* this problem
from the Earth. On the TV show “The Brady Bunch”, their
bathroom didn’t even have a toilet. Pooping is so taboo, it was *literally* invisible. We can’t even talk about it! It’s no coincidence that many of our worst
swear words involve defecation. In her book The Big Necessity, Rose George
writes: “How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats
its humans too” Everybody poops, and every person who is born
should be able to do it safely. Stay curious! And please… always wash your hands when you’re done. Hey everyone, as always, thank you for watching
and learning with us. This week’s video was a stinky but important
subject, and it was brought to you thanks to the support of Bill and Melinda Gates. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates have supported
efforts around the world to make people healthier and make their lives better through innovation,
education, and investing in projects to build a better future. And it’s working! Since 1990, an estimated **122 million** children’s
lives have been saved, thanks to things like better nutrition, family planning, economic
opportunities, and vaccines. Here’s some proof: In 1988 there were more
than 350,000 cases of polio. And last year? Only 34. Things have gotten a LOT better, and one day
soon, that number *can be, and will be zero*. But whether it’s bringing toilets to 2.4
billion people, or erasing the last few cases of polio, progress only happens when the privileged
pay attention. Go to gatesletter.com to read Bill and Melinda
Gates’ Annual Letter, and find out all the ways life has and will continue to improve
for the world’s poorest I’ll see you next time.

**Transcript**:
[PBSDS BUMPER] The average person gets rid of approximately 130 grams of poop every day. Maybe twice that much if they’ve had Taco
Bell. Seven and a half billion of us on Earth? That’s a literal mountain of human poop
every day. Yet most of *us* get to pretend it doesn’t
exist, all thanks to an invention that has improved health and quality of life more than
any other in humanity’s history. [OPEN BUMPER] Bears do it in the woods, whales do it in the ocean, and 2.4 *billion* of us DON’T
do it in a toilet. Dysentery, typhoid, parasites, and other infections
lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, all because one in three people alive
in 2017 don’t have access to toilets and latrines. From on top of our porcelain thrones, we’ve
left a lot of our species drowning in feces. Nearly a *billion* people still defecate out
in the open: in street gutters, open water, or… in the woods. Thousands of years ago, we all did it that
way, but as we developed agriculture and settled into towns, poop started piling up. Around five thousand years ago, Neolithic
villagers constructed the first known toilets at Skara Brae. At the same time, many houses in Mohenjo Daro,
featured toilets complete with drains, people washed their poop into sewers that emptied
into the Indus River. It’d be thousands of years before we linked
germs to disease, but avoiding filth has deep evolutionary roots. Bodily excretions, death, and rotten smells
can be signs of danger or disease, triggering our innate sense of disgust. This biological instinct ended up in the moral
codes of many religions, like this passage from the Old Testament instructing the Hebrews
to do their Exodus in a… hole-y fashion. Roman society was comfortable with caca. At one point, Rome had 144 public toilets…
long open benches that emptied into the Cloaca Maxima, a sewer system that carried waste
to the Tiber river. But the vast majority of Romans simply pooped
in a pot and threw it into the street. As waste and disease piled up, Romans pointed
to the stink as the cause of sickness. After the Roman Empire faded away, this connection
between bad air and bad health persisted, clogging up toilet innovation for more than
a thousand years. During medieval outbreaks like the Plague,
doctors wore pointed masks, filled with strong herbs or perfumes to “cleanse” bad air,
which they believed to be the cause of disease. They were wrong, but this obsession with stink
would change the world in ways no one saw coming. Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper
didn’t invent the flush toilet. That honor goes to John Harington, his “Ajax”
device emptied the bowl with water from an overhead tank. But flush toilets didn’t catch on until
1775, when Alexander Cummings revolutionized the way we poo by adding a water-filled “S
trap” to block explosive, and supposedly disease-causing sewer gas from rising up the
pipes, the same basic toilet design we still use today. During the Industrial Revolution, most people’s
business still ended up in streets and cesspools, and the growing population was too big a load
for London’s sewers. By the mid-1800s, the city was literally overflowing
with crap. With crap comes cholera, an infection from
bacteria whose toxins basically cause all the water in your body to pour out of your
butt in the form of diarrhea, death by dehydration. Cholera hit London in 1854. Instead of the “old bad air” theory, a
doctor named John Snow believed cholera was transmitted by drinking water tainted with
sewage. Snow’s map of cholera cases clustered around
a water pump. When he when he removed the pump’s handle,
new cholera cases fell. Soon after, London enclosed its sewers and
diverted waste downstream of London, but doctors wouldn’t totally accept Snow’s ideas for
nearly 50 years. The Great Depression saw an expansion of sewage
treatment plants–and modern toilet paper!–and this is basically the sanitation system we
have today, where magical chairs make nasty things disappear, out of sight, out of smell,
and out of mind. It’s no three sea shells but we've come a long way. …and this privileged pooping existence lets
us keep something else out of mind: The 2.4 BILLION people who still don’t have toilets. Nearly 800,000 children under 5 still die
every year from diarrhea. More than AIDS, more than malaria. That’s an Airbus A380 full of children crashing
every 6 hours. It’s estimated last year poor sanitation
cost the global economy $260 billion, due to illness, loss of income, and years of life
lost. Worse, women suffer these impacts disproportionately
to men. In 2007, readers of the BMJ voted “modern
sanitation” as the #1 medical advance since 1840. Not antibiotics, not vaccines. Toilets and clean water. We *have* made progress. Since 1990, 14% more people have access to
sanitation, and *many* fewer are dying, but fewer is not zero. With a little effort, we can *wipe* this problem
from the Earth. On the TV show “The Brady Bunch”, their
bathroom didn’t even have a toilet. Pooping is so taboo, it was *literally* invisible. We can’t even talk about it! It’s no coincidence that many of our worst
swear words involve defecation. In her book The Big Necessity, Rose George
writes: “How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats
its humans too” Everybody poops, and every person who is born
should be able to do it safely. Stay curious! And please… always wash your hands when you’re done. Hey everyone, as always, thank you for watching
and learning with us. This week’s video was a stinky but important
subject, and it was brought to you thanks to the support of Bill and Melinda Gates. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates have supported
efforts around the world to make people healthier and make their lives better through innovation,
education, and investing in projects to build a better future. And it’s working! Since 1990, an estimated **122 million** children’s
lives have been saved, thanks to things like better nutrition, family planning, economic
opportunities, and vaccines. Here’s some proof: In 1988 there were more
than 350,000 cases of polio. And last year? Only 34. Things have gotten a LOT better, and one day
soon, that number *can be, and will be zero*. But whether it’s bringing toilets to 2.4

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the change in lifestyle that caused "poop to start piling up." The correct answer is the change to an agricultural society and moving into towns.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most similar in terms of theme and intent. It asks about the location where the first known toilets were constructed around 5,000 years ago. While it doesn't directly ask about the change in lifestyle, it is related to the same time period and the development of toilets, which is connected to the change in lifestyle mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer examination of the transcript reveals that Question 3 is not the best match. A better match would be a question that asks about the change in lifestyle, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it's not a perfect match. A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the association of illness and death with something other than microorganisms and excrement. The correct option is "bad odors." 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is somewhat related to the topic of disease prevention, but it doesn't directly address the association with bad odors.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall content and intent, I would suggest Question 4: "What was the primary reason for the construction of the first sewers in ancient civilizations?" 

Although this question doesn't directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the topic of disease prevention and waste management, which is the broader context of the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4

Please note that this match is not exact, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the association of illness and death with bad odors.

**Transcript**:
[PBSDS BUMPER] The average person gets rid of approximately 130 grams of poop every day. Maybe twice that much if they’ve had Taco
Bell. Seven and a half billion of us on Earth? That’s a literal mountain of human poop
every day. Yet most of *us* get to pretend it doesn’t
exist, all thanks to an invention that has improved health and quality of life more than
any other in humanity’s history. [OPEN BUMPER] Bears do it in the woods, whales do it in the ocean, and 2.4 *billion* of us DON’T
do it in a toilet. Dysentery, typhoid, parasites, and other infections
lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, all because one in three people alive
in 2017 don’t have access to toilets and latrines. From on top of our porcelain thrones, we’ve
left a lot of our species drowning in feces. Nearly a *billion* people still defecate out
in the open: in street gutters, open water, or… in the woods. Thousands of years ago, we all did it that
way, but as we developed agriculture and settled into towns, poop started piling up. Around five thousand years ago, Neolithic
villagers constructed the first known toilets at Skara Brae. At the same time, many houses in Mohenjo Daro,
featured toilets complete with drains, people washed their poop into sewers that emptied
into the Indus River. It’d be thousands of years before we linked
germs to disease, but avoiding filth has deep evolutionary roots. Bodily excretions, death, and rotten smells
can be signs of danger or disease, triggering our innate sense of disgust. This biological instinct ended up in the moral
codes of many religions, like this passage from the Old Testament instructing the Hebrews
to do their Exodus in a… hole-y fashion. Roman society was comfortable with caca. At one point, Rome had 144 public toilets…
long open benches that emptied into the Cloaca Maxima, a sewer system that carried waste
to the Tiber river. But the vast majority of Romans simply pooped
in a pot and threw it into the street. As waste and disease piled up, Romans pointed
to the stink as the cause of sickness. After the Roman Empire faded away, this connection
between bad air and bad health persisted, clogging up toilet innovation for more than
a thousand years. During medieval outbreaks like the Plague,
doctors wore pointed masks, filled with strong herbs or perfumes to “cleanse” bad air,
which they believed to be the cause of disease. They were wrong, but this obsession with stink
would change the world in ways no one saw coming. Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper
didn’t invent the flush toilet. That honor goes to John Harington, his “Ajax”
device emptied the bowl with water from an overhead tank. But flush toilets didn’t catch on until
1775, when Alexander Cummings revolutionized the way we poo by adding a water-filled “S
trap” to block explosive, and supposedly disease-causing sewer gas from rising up the
pipes, the same basic toilet design we still use today. During the Industrial Revolution, most people’s
business still ended up in streets and cesspools, and the growing population was too big a load
for London’s sewers. By the mid-1800s, the city was literally overflowing
with crap. With crap comes cholera, an infection from
bacteria whose toxins basically cause all the water in your body to pour out of your
butt in the form of diarrhea, death by dehydration. Cholera hit London in 1854. Instead of the “old bad air” theory, a
doctor named John Snow believed cholera was transmitted by drinking water tainted with
sewage. Snow’s map of cholera cases clustered around
a water pump. When he when he removed the pump’s handle,
new cholera cases fell. Soon after, London enclosed its sewers and
diverted waste downstream of London, but doctors wouldn’t totally accept Snow’s ideas for
nearly 50 years. The Great Depression saw an expansion of sewage
treatment plants–and modern toilet paper!–and this is basically the sanitation system we
have today, where magical chairs make nasty things disappear, out of sight, out of smell,
and out of mind. It’s no three sea shells but we've come a long way. …and this privileged pooping existence lets
us keep something else out of mind: The 2.4 BILLION people who still don’t have toilets. Nearly 800,000 children under 5 still die
every year from diarrhea. More than AIDS, more than malaria. That’s an Airbus A380 full of children crashing
every 6 hours. It’s estimated last year poor sanitation
cost the global economy $260 billion, due to illness, loss of income, and years of life
lost. Worse, women suffer these impacts disproportionately
to men. In 2007, readers of the BMJ voted “modern
sanitation” as the #1 medical advance since 1840. Not antibiotics, not vaccines. Toilets and clean water. We *have* made progress. Since 1990, 14% more people have access to
sanitation, and *many* fewer are dying, but fewer is not zero. With a little effort, we can *wipe* this problem
from the Earth. On the TV show “The Brady Bunch”, their
bathroom didn’t even have a toilet. Pooping is so taboo, it was *literally* invisible. We can’t even talk about it! It’s no coincidence that many of our worst
swear words involve defecation. In her book The Big Necessity, Rose George
writes: “How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats
its humans too” Everybody poops, and every person who is born
should be able to do it safely. Stay curious! And please… always wash your hands when you’re done. Hey everyone, as always, thank you for watching
and learning with us. This week’s video was a stinky but important
subject, and it was brought to you thanks to the support of Bill and Melinda Gates. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates have supported
efforts around the world to make people healthier and make their lives better through innovation,
education, and investing in projects to build a better future. And it’s working! Since 1990, an estimated **122 million** children’s
lives have been saved, thanks to things like better nutrition, family planning, economic
opportunities, and vaccines. Here’s some proof: In 1988 there were more
than 350,000 cases of polio. And last year? Only 34. Things have gotten a LOT better, and one day
soon, that number *can be, and will be zero*. But whether it’s bringing toilets to 2.4
billion people, or erasing the last few cases of polio, progress only happens when the privileged
pay attention. Go to gatesletter.com to read Bill and Melinda
Gates’ Annual Letter, and find out all the ways life has and will continue to improve
for the world’s poorest I’ll see you next time.

**Transcript**:
Approximately 7 million people around the 
world die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other
problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack,
it can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls 
of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn
into blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it
in minutes, and a partially closed artery
can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off 
to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate
in the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able
to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario,
a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone
is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived 
heart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic
as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent
in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be 
having a heart attack, the most important thing 
is to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical
services, call them. They're the fastest way 
to get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, 
which opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack
from getting worse. In the emergency room, 
doctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's 
electrical activity and a blood test to assess 
heart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech
cardiac suite where tests are done 
to locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen 
the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon
in a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal
or polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require
coronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery
from another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow
around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation
to the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors
both affect your risk. And the good news is that you can
change your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet,
and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising
a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity
and strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low
in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts
and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also
keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower 
your heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose
aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've
already had a heart attack and for those known to be
at high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol,
and diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, 
but they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep
and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure
your body's most important muscle keeps on beating.

**Transcript**:
Approximately 7 million people around the 
world die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other
problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack,
it can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls 
of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn
into blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it
in minutes, and a partially closed artery
can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off 
to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate
in the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able
to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario,
a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone
is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived 
heart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic
as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent
in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be 
having a heart attack, the most important thing 
is to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical
services, call them. They're the fastest way 
to get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, 
which opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack
from getting worse. In the emergency room, 
doctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's 
electrical activity and a blood test to assess 
heart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech
cardiac suite where tests are done 
to locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen 
the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon
in a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal
or polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require
coronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery
from another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow
around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation
to the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors
both affect your risk. And the good news is that you can
change your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet,
and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising
a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity
and strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low
in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts
and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also
keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower 
your heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose
aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've
already had a heart attack and for those known to be
at high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol,
and diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, 
but they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep
and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure
your body's most important muscle keeps on beating.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the options in Question 7 do not exactly match those in the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. Question 7 asks about a specific medical procedure (angioplasty) that involves inflating a blocked artery with a balloon to restore blood flow, which is one of the treatments mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. 

However, a more similar question would be one that asks about the possible treatments for a blocked artery, listing the same options as the ground truth MCQ (balloon angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery). Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What lifestyle changes can help lower the risk of heart attacks?**

Although the question is not an exact match, the intent of the question is similar, and the options provided in Question 8 are related to reducing the risk of heart attacks, which aligns with the ground truth MCQ. However, I noticed that Question 8 does not have an option that clearly does not reduce the risk of heart attacks, unlike the ground truth MCQ.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs revealed that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would suggest:

**Question 8**

However, I would like to propose an alternative approach. Since the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I can try to identify the question that could be modified to match the ground truth MCQ. In this case, I would suggest modifying **Question 8** to match the ground truth MCQ by changing the question and options to reflect the correct information.

If you would like, I can try to propose a modified version of Question 8 that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope
at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper, a spot that was dark and out of the way
of light pollution from surrounding stars. The location was apparently empty,
and the whole endeavor was risky. What, if anything, was going to show up? Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours
of exposure of that same area. And what came back 
was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver 
of the universe. Now, let's take a step back to understand
the scale of this image. If you were to take a ballpoint pen and hold it at arm's length 
in front of the night sky, focusing on its very tip, that is what the Hubble Telescope captured
in its first Deep Field image. In other words, those 3,000 galaxies were seen 
in just a tiny speck of the universe, approximately one two-millionth
of the night sky. To put all this in perspective, the average human measures
about 1.7 meters. With Earth's diameter 
at 12,700 kilometers, that's nearly 7.5 million humans
lined up head to toe. The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance
of 380,000 kilometers to the moon. And our relatively small Sun has a
diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, or 110 times the Earth's diameter. A step further, the Milky Way holds somewhere 
between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured
in the Deep Field image contains billions of stars
at the very least. Almost a decade after taking
the Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics
on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure
over a period of about four months. This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies. Half of these galaxies have since been
analyzed more clearly in what's known as 
the eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years 
of photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only 
one ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe
from the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time
are inextricably linked. That's because of 
the finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like
time machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies
that existed over 13 billion years ago. This means we're looking
at the universe as it was less than a billion years 
after the Big Bang, and it allows scientists to research
galaxies in their infancy. The Deep Field images have also shown
that the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different
spots in the sky look similar. That's incredible when we think about
how vast the universe is. Why would we expect it to be the same
across such huge distances? On the scale of a galaxy, 
let alone the universe, we're smaller than 
we can readily comprehend, but we do have the capacity to wonder, to question, to explore, to investigate, and to imagine. So the next time you stand gazing up
at the night sky, take a moment to think about the enormity
of what is beyond your vision, out in the dark spaces between the stars.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the context of the passage, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time spent gathering images for the Hubble Deep Field image. In the passage, it is mentioned that "Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours of exposure of that same area" for the first Deep Field image, and later it is mentioned that "scientists adjusted the optics on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure over a period of about four months" for the eXtreme Deep Field image (XDF).

Considering this information, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about the time spent gathering images for one of the Deep Field images. However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about this.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would choose Question 6, which asks about the name of the image created by combining over ten years of photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope. This question is related to the context of the passage, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that Question 6 mentions "combining over ten years of photographs," which implies a long period of time. Additionally, the passage mentions that "scientists adjusted the optics on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure over a period of about four months" for the eXtreme Deep Field image (XDF). 

But there is another question that is more closely related to the time spent gathering images: Question 7. It mentions that "Half of these galaxies have since been analyzed more clearly in what's known as the eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years of photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only one ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe from the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time are inextricably linked. That's because of the finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like time machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies that existed over 13 billion years ago. This means we're looking at the universe as it was less than a billion years after the Big Bang, and it allows scientists to research galaxies in their infancy. The Deep Field images have also shown that the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different spots in the sky look similar. That's incredible when we think about how vast the universe is. Why would we expect it to be the same across such huge distances?"

However, just before question 7, the text states that "Almost a decade after taking the Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure over a period of about four months."

Therefore, the closest match is actually none of the questions, but I would argue that the closest generated question is actually not present.

**Transcript**:
In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope
at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper, a spot that was dark and out of the way
of light pollution from surrounding stars. The location was apparently empty,
and the whole endeavor was risky. What, if anything, was going to show up? Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours
of exposure of that same area. And what came back 
was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver 
of the universe. Now, let's take a step back to understand
the scale of this image. If you were to take a ballpoint pen and hold it at arm's length 
in front of the night sky, focusing on its very tip, that is what the Hubble Telescope captured
in its first Deep Field image. In other words, those 3,000 galaxies were seen 
in just a tiny speck of the universe, approximately one two-millionth
of the night sky. To put all this in perspective, the average human measures
about 1.7 meters. With Earth's diameter 
at 12,700 kilometers, that's nearly 7.5 million humans
lined up head to toe. The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance
of 380,000 kilometers to the moon. And our relatively small Sun has a
diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, or 110 times the Earth's diameter. A step further, the Milky Way holds somewhere 
between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured
in the Deep Field image contains billions of stars
at the very least. Almost a decade after taking
the Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics
on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure
over a period of about four months. This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies. Half of these galaxies have since been
analyzed more clearly in what's known as 
the eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years 
of photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only 
one ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe
from the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time
are inextricably linked. That's because of 
the finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like
time machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies

that the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different
spots in the sky look similar. That's incredible when we think about
how vast the universe is. Why would we expect it to be the same
across such huge distances? On the scale of a galaxy, 
let alone the universe, we're smaller than 
we can readily comprehend, but we do have the capacity to wonder, to question, to explore, to investigate, and to imagine. So the next time you stand gazing up
at the night sky, take a moment to think about the enormity
of what is beyond your vision, out in the dark spaces between the stars.

**Transcript**:
Will winning the lottery make you happier? Imagine winning a multi-million dollar
lottery tomorrow. If you're like many of us,
you'd be ecstatic, unable to believe your good luck. But would that joy still be there
a few years later? Maybe not. A famous study of 22 lottery winners
showed that months after winning, their average reported levels of happiness
had increased no more than that of a control group 
who hadn't won the lottery. Some were actually unhappier
than they had been before winning. And later studies have confirmed that
our emotional well-being, how often and how intensely 
we feel things like joy, sorrow, anxiety, or anger, don't seem to improve with wealth
or status beyond a certain point. This has to do with a phenomenon
known as hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill. It describes our tendency to adapt
to new situations to maintain a stable 
emotional equilibrium. When it comes to feeling happy, most of us seem to have a base level that
stays more or less constant throughout our existence. Of course, the novelty of better food, superior vacations, and more beautiful homes can at first make you feel like you're
walking on air, but as you get used to those things, you revert to your 
default emotional state. That might sound pretty gloomy, but hedonic adaptation makes us 
less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change, including negative ones. The study with the lottery winners also looked at people who had suffered 
an accident that left them paralyzed. When asked several months after
their accidents how happy they were, they reported levels of happiness
approaching their original baseline. So while the hedonic treadmill may
inhibit our enjoyment of positive changes, it seems to also enable our resilience
in recovering from adversity. There are other reasons 
that winning the lottery may not make us happier in the long run. It can be difficult to manage
large sums of money, and some lottery winners wind up
spending or losing it all quickly. It can also be socially isolating. Some winners experience a deluge of
unwelcome requests for money, so they wind up cutting themselves off
from others. And wealth may actually make us meaner. In one study, participants played
a rigged game of monopoly where the experimenters made
some players rich quickly. The wealthy players started
patronizing the poorer players and hogging the snacks 
they were meant to share. But just because a huge influx of cash isn't guaranteed to bring 
joy into your life doesn't mean that money 
can never make us happier. Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic
and material things, like a new car or a bigger house, much faster than we do 
to novel experiences, like visiting a new place
or learning a new skill. So by that reasoning, the more you spend money
on experiences rather than things, the happier you'd be. And there's another way to turn
your money into happiness: spend it on other people. In one study, participants were
given some money and were either asked to spend it
on themselves or on someone else. Later that evening, researchers called up
these participants and asked them how happy they were. The happiness levels of those who had
spent the money on others were significantly greater than that
of those who had spent it on themselves. And that seems to be true 
around the world. Another study examined the generosity
of over 200,000 people from 136 countries. In over 90% of these countries, people who donated tended to be happier
than those who didn't. But this may all be easier said than done. Let's say a million dollars 
falls into your lap tomorrow. What do you do with it?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as Question 1.

**Reasoning:**

* Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 1 aim to assess the impact of winning the lottery on long-term happiness.
* Options: Although the options in Question 1 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, they both relate to the outcome of a study on lottery winners and their reported levels of happiness.
* Content: The content of Question 1 is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, as it specifically mentions a study of 22 lottery winners and their reported levels of happiness months after winning.

**Index of the most similar generated MCQ:** 1

However, it's worth noting that Question 1 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not provide an option that explicitly states "winning the lottery has little or no effect on long-term happiness" or "can make you less happy than you were before winning it." Nevertheless, among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Will winning the lottery make you happier? Imagine winning a multi-million dollar
lottery tomorrow. If you're like many of us,
you'd be ecstatic, unable to believe your good luck. But would that joy still be there
a few years later? Maybe not. A famous study of 22 lottery winners
showed that months after winning, their average reported levels of happiness
had increased no more than that of a control group 
who hadn't won the lottery. Some were actually unhappier
than they had been before winning. And later studies have confirmed that
our emotional well-being, how often and how intensely 
we feel things like joy, sorrow, anxiety, or anger, don't seem to improve with wealth
or status beyond a certain point. This has to do with a phenomenon
known as hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill. It describes our tendency to adapt
to new situations to maintain a stable 
emotional equilibrium. When it comes to feeling happy, most of us seem to have a base level that
stays more or less constant throughout our existence. Of course, the novelty of better food, superior vacations, and more beautiful homes can at first make you feel like you're
walking on air, but as you get used to those things, you revert to your 
default emotional state. That might sound pretty gloomy, but hedonic adaptation makes us 
less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change, including negative ones. The study with the lottery winners also looked at people who had suffered 
an accident that left them paralyzed. When asked several months after
their accidents how happy they were, they reported levels of happiness
approaching their original baseline. So while the hedonic treadmill may
inhibit our enjoyment of positive changes, it seems to also enable our resilience
in recovering from adversity. There are other reasons 
that winning the lottery may not make us happier in the long run. It can be difficult to manage
large sums of money, and some lottery winners wind up
spending or losing it all quickly. It can also be socially isolating. Some winners experience a deluge of
unwelcome requests for money, so they wind up cutting themselves off
from others. And wealth may actually make us meaner. In one study, participants played
a rigged game of monopoly where the experimenters made
some players rich quickly. The wealthy players started
patronizing the poorer players and hogging the snacks 
they were meant to share. But just because a huge influx of cash isn't guaranteed to bring 
joy into your life doesn't mean that money 
can never make us happier. Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic
and material things, like a new car or a bigger house, much faster than we do 
to novel experiences, like visiting a new place
or learning a new skill. So by that reasoning, the more you spend money
on experiences rather than things, the happier you'd be. And there's another way to turn
your money into happiness: spend it on other people. In one study, participants were
given some money and were either asked to spend it
on themselves or on someone else. Later that evening, researchers called up
these participants and asked them how happy they were. The happiness levels of those who had
spent the money on others were significantly greater than that
of those who had spent it on themselves. And that seems to be true 
around the world. Another study examined the generosity
of over 200,000 people from 136 countries. In over 90% of these countries, people who donated tended to be happier
than those who didn't. But this may all be easier said than done. Let's say a million dollars 
falls into your lap tomorrow. What do you do with it?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not have an exact match with the ground truth MCQ in terms of options, its question content is the most similar. Question 2 asks about the phenomenon that describes our tendency to adapt to new situations to maintain a stable emotional equilibrium, which is the definition of the hedonic treadmill mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more suitable match can be created by combining Question 2 with another question that includes the concept of being less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change. Unfortunately, such a question does not exist among the provided generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2.

**Transcript**:
A close encounter with
a man-eating giant, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, a long-lost king taking back his throne. On their own, any of these make
great stories, but each is just one episode
in the "Odyssey," a 12,000-line poem spanning years of
Ancient Greek history, myth, and legend. How do we make sense 
of such a massive text that comes from and tells of a world
so far away? The fact that we can read the "Odyssey"
at all is pretty incredible, as it was composed before the Greek
alphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE. It was made for listeners 
rather than readers, and was performed by oral poets
called rhapsodes. Tradition identifies its author
as a blind man named Homer. But no one definitively knows whether
he was real or legendary. The earliest mentions of him occur
centuries after his era. And the poems attributed to him
seem to have been changed and rearranged many times
by multiple authors before finally being written down
in their current form. In fact, the word rhapsode means
stitching together, as these poets combined existing stories,
jokes, myths, and songs into a single narrative. To recite these massive epics live, rhapsodes employed a steady meter, along with mnemonic devices, like repetition of memorized passages
or set pieces. These included descriptions of scenery
and lists of characters, and helped the rhapsode keep
their place in the narrative, just as the chorus or bridge of a song
helps us to remember the next verses. Because most of the tales were familiar
to the audience, it was common to hear the sections
of the poem out of order. At some point, the order 
became set in stone and the story was locked into place
as the one we read today. But since the world has changed
a bit in the last several thousand years, it helps to have some background
before jumping in. The "Odyssey" itself is a sequel to Homer's
other famous epic, the "Iliad," which tells the story of the Trojan War. If there's one major theme uniting
both poems, it's this: do not, under any circumstances,
incur the wrath of the gods. The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix
of divine power and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges
of epic proportions. And many of the problems faced by humans
in the poems are caused by their hubris, or excessive pride in believing themselves
superior to the gods. The desire to please the gods was so great that the Ancient Greeks traditionally
welcomed all strangers into their homes with generosity for fear that the strangers 
might be gods in disguise. This ancient code of hospitality
was called xenia. It involved hosts providing their guests
with safety, food, and comfort, and the guests returning the favor
with courtesy and gifts if they had them. Xenia has a significant role 
in the "Odyssey," where Odysseus in his wanderings
is the perpetual guest, while in his absence, his clever wife
Penelope plays non-stop host. The "Odyssey" recounts all 
of Odysseus's years of travel, but the narrative begins in medias res
in the middle of things. Ten years after the Trojan War,
we find our hero trapped on an island, still far from his native Ithaca and
the family he hasn't seen for 20 years. Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon
by blinding his son, a cyclops, Odysseus's passage home has been
fraught with mishap after mishap. With trouble brewing at home
and gods discussing his fate, Odysseus begins the account
of those missing years to his hosts. One of the most fascinating things
about the "Odyssey" is the gap between how little we know
about its time period and the wealth of detail the text
itself contains. Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries 
searching for the ruins of Troy and identifying which islands
Odysseus visited. Just like its hero, the 24-book epic
has made its own long journey through centuries of myth and history to tell us its incredible story today.

**Transcript**:
A close encounter with
a man-eating giant, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, a long-lost king taking back his throne. On their own, any of these make
great stories, but each is just one episode
in the "Odyssey," a 12,000-line poem spanning years of
Ancient Greek history, myth, and legend. How do we make sense 
of such a massive text that comes from and tells of a world
so far away? The fact that we can read the "Odyssey"
at all is pretty incredible, as it was composed before the Greek
alphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE. It was made for listeners 
rather than readers, and was performed by oral poets
called rhapsodes. Tradition identifies its author
as a blind man named Homer. But no one definitively knows whether
he was real or legendary. The earliest mentions of him occur
centuries after his era. And the poems attributed to him
seem to have been changed and rearranged many times
by multiple authors before finally being written down
in their current form. In fact, the word rhapsode means
stitching together, as these poets combined existing stories,
jokes, myths, and songs into a single narrative. To recite these massive epics live, rhapsodes employed a steady meter, along with mnemonic devices, like repetition of memorized passages
or set pieces. These included descriptions of scenery
and lists of characters, and helped the rhapsode keep
their place in the narrative, just as the chorus or bridge of a song
helps us to remember the next verses. Because most of the tales were familiar
to the audience, it was common to hear the sections
of the poem out of order. At some point, the order 
became set in stone and the story was locked into place
as the one we read today. But since the world has changed
a bit in the last several thousand years, it helps to have some background
before jumping in. The "Odyssey" itself is a sequel to Homer's
other famous epic, the "Iliad," which tells the story of the Trojan War. If there's one major theme uniting
both poems, it's this: do not, under any circumstances,
incur the wrath of the gods. The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix
of divine power and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges
of epic proportions. And many of the problems faced by humans
in the poems are caused by their hubris, or excessive pride in believing themselves
superior to the gods. The desire to please the gods was so great that the Ancient Greeks traditionally
welcomed all strangers into their homes with generosity for fear that the strangers 
might be gods in disguise. This ancient code of hospitality
was called xenia. It involved hosts providing their guests
with safety, food, and comfort, and the guests returning the favor
with courtesy and gifts if they had them. Xenia has a significant role 
in the "Odyssey," where Odysseus in his wanderings
is the perpetual guest, while in his absence, his clever wife
Penelope plays non-stop host. The "Odyssey" recounts all 
of Odysseus's years of travel, but the narrative begins in medias res
in the middle of things. Ten years after the Trojan War,
we find our hero trapped on an island, still far from his native Ithaca and
the family he hasn't seen for 20 years. Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon
by blinding his son, a cyclops, Odysseus's passage home has been
fraught with mishap after mishap. With trouble brewing at home
and gods discussing his fate, Odysseus begins the account
of those missing years to his hosts. One of the most fascinating things
about the "Odyssey" is the gap between how little we know
about its time period and the wealth of detail the text
itself contains. Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries 
searching for the ruins of Troy and identifying which islands
Odysseus visited. Just like its hero, the 24-book epic
has made its own long journey through centuries of myth and history to tell us its incredible story today.

**Transcript**:
You breathe in about 17,000 times per day. It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated
effort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen
to tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients
of aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces
a molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their
many incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our
bodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in
from their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently
over tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells
within our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion 
red blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million
oxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses
raw materials that become available from
the food we eat. So in some ways, you could say
that oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical
and chemical digestion, food gets broken down into
its smallest elements, like iron, the building block
of hemoglobin. Iron is carried through 
the cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace 
of red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within
our bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate 
our levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow
to increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million
red blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire
population of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs
will have ample transportation. But before oxygen 
can even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message
through your nervous system, all the way to muscles 
of the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space
inside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs
internal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs
as two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more 
complicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels
within your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules
that are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact
with the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures
that very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into
hundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections
called alveoli that dramatically increase 
the contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of
extremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and
capillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough
for diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then
carried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels
that reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out
end to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth
several times. Propelling red blood cells
through this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average
of about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately
gets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system
is built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned,
so would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones, 
lungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act
of coordination that keeps you alive. Breathe out.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You breathe in about 17,000 times per day. It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated
effort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen
to tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients
of aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces
a molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their
many incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our
bodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in
from their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently
over tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells
within our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion 
red blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million
oxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses
raw materials that become available from
the food we eat. So in some ways, you could say
that oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical
and chemical digestion, food gets broken down into
its smallest elements, like iron, the building block
of hemoglobin. Iron is carried through 
the cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace 
of red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within
our bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate 
our levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow
to increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million
red blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire
population of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs
will have ample transportation. But before oxygen 
can even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message
through your nervous system, all the way to muscles 
of the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space
inside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs
internal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs
as two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more 
complicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels
within your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules
that are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact
with the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures
that very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into
hundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections
called alveoli that dramatically increase 
the contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of
extremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and
capillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough
for diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then
carried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels
that reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out
end to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth
several times. Propelling red blood cells
through this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average
of about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately
gets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system
is built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned,
so would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones, 
lungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act
of coordination that keeps you alive. Breathe out.

**Transcript**:
Why do we buy certain products
or choose certain brands? This is the sort of question advertisers
have always asked, and there are no easy answers. However, there is a handy tool
that helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group. Until the 1940s, market research
was often quantitative using things like sales figures
and customer polls to track consumption. But this changed during World War II. Sociologists Robert Merton
and Paul Lazarsfeld set out to learn how unprecedented
exposure to wartime propaganda was affecting the public. Instead of polling large numbers of people with straightforward questions
and quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted 
in-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions. Later, this method was picked up
by the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist
Ernest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group. This new technique was a type
of qualitative research focused on the nature 
of people's preferences and thoughts. It couldn't tell marketers what percentage
of people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about
the people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations
behind those reasons. Rather than providing definite conclusions
for business and sales, focus groups would be used
for exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper
understanding of consumer habits. For example, early focus groups found that
contrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their
husbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing
cars directly to women. And Dr. Dichter himself conducted
focus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll. The result was the original Barbie doll. So how does a focus group work? First, companies recruit between
six and ten participants according to specific criteria
that meet their research objectives. They could be mothers of children
between five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy
a new phone in the next three months. This is often done through professional
recruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in
focus groups for payment or other rewards. During a session, participants are asked
to respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions
on a certain product, or their emotional reactions
to an advertisement. They may even be asked to do
seemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo. The idea is that this can reveal 
useful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions 
might not get to. Beyond these basics,
many variations are possible. A focus group may have two
or more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides
on a question, or a researcher might be hidden
in the focus group unknown to other participants to see
how their answers can be influenced. And the whole process may also
be observed by researchers through a one-way mirror. But although they can provide
valuable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that
the simple act of observing something can change it. This principle is called 
observer interference. The answers participants give are likely to be affected 
by the presence of the researchers, social pressure 
from the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking
part in a focus group. And because researchers often use
a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. The findings that researchers do reach
from focus groups are often tested through experiments
and data gathering. Those put numbers on questions like
how many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay. This part of the process changes
as technology evolves. But focus groups have remained
largely the same for decades. Perhaps when it comes
to the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people
genuinely interacting with each other.

and quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted 
in-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions. Later, this method was picked up
by the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist
Ernest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group. This new technique was a type
of qualitative research focused on the nature 
of people's preferences and thoughts. It couldn't tell marketers what percentage
of people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about
the people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations
behind those reasons. Rather than providing definite conclusions
for business and sales, focus groups would be used
for exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper
understanding of consumer habits. For example, early focus groups found that
contrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their
husbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing
cars directly to women. And Dr. Dichter himself conducted
focus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll. The result was the original Barbie doll. So how does a focus group work? First, companies recruit between
six and ten participants according to specific criteria
that meet their research objectives. They could be mothers of children
between five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy
a new phone in the next three months. This is often done through professional
recruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in
focus groups for payment or other rewards. During a session, participants are asked
to respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions
on a certain product, or their emotional reactions
to an advertisement. They may even be asked to do
seemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo. The idea is that this can reveal 
useful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions 
might not get to. Beyond these basics,
many variations are possible. A focus group may have two
or more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides
on a question, or a researcher might be hidden
in the focus group unknown to other participants to see
how their answers can be influenced. And the whole process may also
be observed by researchers through a one-way mirror. But although they can provide
valuable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that
the simple act of observing something can change it. This principle is called 
observer interference. The answers participants give are likely to be affected 
by the presence of the researchers, social pressure 
from the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking
part in a focus group. And because researchers often use
a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. The findings that researchers do reach
from focus groups are often tested through experiments
and data gathering. Those put numbers on questions like
how many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay. This part of the process changes
as technology evolves. But focus groups have remained
largely the same for decades. Perhaps when it comes
to the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people
genuinely interacting with each other.

Why do we buy certain products
or choose certain brands? This is the sort of question advertisers
have always asked, and there are no easy answers. However, there is a handy tool
that helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group. Until the 1940s, market research
was often quantitative using things like sales figures
and customer polls to track consumption. But this changed during World War II. Sociologists Robert Merton

**Transcript**:
When French mathematician Laurent Schwartz
was in high school, he started to worry that he wasn't
smart enough to solve math problems. Maybe you know a similar feeling. You sit down to take a math test, and you feel your heart beat faster and your palms start to sweat. You get butterflies in your stomach,
and you can't concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you,
you're not alone. Researchers think about 20% 
of the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it
a diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn't
necessarily mean you're bad at math - not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win
the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they're anxious
about math because they're bad at it, but it's often the other way around. They're doing poorly in math
because they're anxious about it. Some psychologists think that's because math anxiety decreases 
a cognitive resource called working memory. That's the short-term memory system that helps you organize the information 
you need to complete a task. Worrying about being able to solve
math problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle
the math itself. People can suddenly struggle
with even basic math skills, like arithmetic, 
that they've otherwise mastered. Academic anxiety certainly
isn't limited to math, but it does seem to happen much
more frequently, and cause more harm
in that subject. So why would that be? Researchers aren't yet sure, but some studies suggest that the way children are exposed
to math by their parents and teachers play a large part. If parents talk about math like
something challenging and unfamiliar, children can internalize that. Teachers with math anxiety are also
likely to spread it to their students. Pressure to solve problems quickly
dials up stress even more. And in some cultures, being good
at math is a sign of being smart in general. When the stakes are that high, it's not surprising 
that students are anxious. Even Maryam Mirzakhani, 
an influential mathematician who was the first woman to win
the Fields Medal, felt unconfident and lost interest
in mathematics because her math teacher in middle school
didn't think she was talented. So if you experience mathematical anxiety, what can you do? Relaxation techniques, 
like short breathing exercises, have improved test performance
in students with math anxiety. Writing down your worries can also help. This strategy may give you a chance
to reevaluate a stressful experience, freeing up working memory. And if you have the chance, physical activity, like a brisk walk,
deepens breathing and helps relieve muscle tension, preventing anxiety from building. You can also use your knowledge
about the brain to change your mindset. The brain is flexible, and the areas involved in math skills 
can always grow and develop. This is a psychological principle
called the growth mindset. Thinking of yourself as someone
who can grow and improve can actually help you grow and improve. If you're a teacher 
or parent of young children, try being playful with math
and focusing on the creative aspects. That can build the numerical skills that help students approach math 
with confidence later on. Importantly, you should give children
the time and space to work through their answers. And if you're an administrator, make sure your teachers 
have the positive attitudes and mathematical confidence necessary to inspire confidence 
in all of their students. Also, don't let anyone spread the myth that boys are innately 
better than girls at math. That is completely false. If you experience math anxiety, it may not help to just know 
that math anxiety exists. Or perhaps it's reassuring to put
a name to the problem. Regardless, if you take a look
around yourself, the odds are good that you'll see someone 
experiencing the same thing as you. Just remember that the anxiety is not
a reflection of your ability, but it is something you can conquer 
with time and awareness.

**Transcript**:
When French mathematician Laurent Schwartz
was in high school, he started to worry that he wasn't
smart enough to solve math problems. Maybe you know a similar feeling. You sit down to take a math test, and you feel your heart beat faster and your palms start to sweat. You get butterflies in your stomach,
and you can't concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you,
you're not alone. Researchers think about 20% 
of the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it
a diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn't
necessarily mean you're bad at math - not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win
the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they're anxious
about math because they're bad at it, but it's often the other way around. They're doing poorly in math
because they're anxious about it. Some psychologists think that's because math anxiety decreases 
a cognitive resource called working memory. That's the short-term memory system that helps you organize the information 
you need to complete a task. Worrying about being able to solve
math problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle
the math itself. People can suddenly struggle
with even basic math skills, like arithmetic, 
that they've otherwise mastered. Academic anxiety certainly
isn't limited to math, but it does seem to happen much
more frequently, and cause more harm
in that subject. So why would that be? Researchers aren't yet sure, but some studies suggest that the way children are exposed
to math by their parents and teachers play a large part. If parents talk about math like
something challenging and unfamiliar, children can internalize that. Teachers with math anxiety are also
likely to spread it to their students. Pressure to solve problems quickly
dials up stress even more. And in some cultures, being good
at math is a sign of being smart in general. When the stakes are that high, it's not surprising 
that students are anxious. Even Maryam Mirzakhani, 
an influential mathematician who was the first woman to win
the Fields Medal, felt unconfident and lost interest
in mathematics because her math teacher in middle school
didn't think she was talented. So if you experience mathematical anxiety, what can you do? Relaxation techniques, 
like short breathing exercises, have improved test performance
in students with math anxiety. Writing down your worries can also help. This strategy may give you a chance
to reevaluate a stressful experience, freeing up working memory. And if you have the chance, physical activity, like a brisk walk,
deepens breathing and helps relieve muscle tension, preventing anxiety from building. You can also use your knowledge
about the brain to change your mindset. The brain is flexible, and the areas involved in math skills 
can always grow and develop. This is a psychological principle
called the growth mindset. Thinking of yourself as someone
who can grow and improve can actually help you grow and improve. If you're a teacher 
or parent of young children, try being playful with math
and focusing on the creative aspects. That can build the numerical skills that help students approach math 
with confidence later on. Importantly, you should give children
the time and space to work through their answers. And if you're an administrator, make sure your teachers 
have the positive attitudes and mathematical confidence necessary to inspire confidence 
in all of their students. Also, don't let anyone spread the myth that boys are innately 
better than girls at math. That is completely false. If you experience math anxiety, it may not help to just know 
that math anxiety exists. Or perhaps it's reassuring to put
a name to the problem. Regardless, if you take a look
around yourself, the odds are good that you'll see someone 
experiencing the same thing as you. Just remember that the anxiety is not
a reflection of your ability, but it is something you can conquer 
with time and awareness.

**Transcript**:
Muhammad Ali spent years training
to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create
the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's 
graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, 
the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered
the shortest poem ever. "Me, we." Or is it "me, weeee"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,
then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled
with this question, often using metaphors to approximate
a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain
recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's
musical qualities. This can be achieved through
rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water
wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature
intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Onion." Poetry, like art itself, has a way
of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" toe the line between visual art
and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems
whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness
of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry
faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people
love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets
in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,
rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. "I can hear sweat trickling 
down your cheek Your heartbeat sound 
like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete." So far, all the examples we've seen
have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words
of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti. "Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing." Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began
in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed
100% of the time.

Muhammad Ali spent years training
to become the greatest boxer the world had ever seen, but only moments to create
the shortest poem. Ali captivated Harvard's 
graduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, 
the audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered
the shortest poem ever. "Me, we." Or is it "me, weeee"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,
then what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled
with this question, often using metaphors to approximate
a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain
recognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's
musical qualities. This can be achieved through
rhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water
wrung out of it. Three - poems often feature
intense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's "Ode to an Onion." Poetry, like art itself, has a way
of challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns 
of the earliest poems were a way to remember stories
even before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's "silencio" toe the line between visual art
and poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems
whose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness
of a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry
faded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people
love to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets
in a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,
rhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. "I can hear sweat trickling 
down your cheek Your heartbeat sound 
like Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete." So far, all the examples we've seen
have had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words
of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti. "Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing." Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began
in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed
100% of the time.

of Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape 
that we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate
the rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images
and wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form
and more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like
Martin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted
updates from the earthquake in Haiti. "Was in b-room getting dressed
when heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing." Smith uses language in a way
that is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form 
that emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, 
seven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, 
prose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began
in verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,
which means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with
the raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human
in a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea
by asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted 
through stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those
made by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while
scientists have successfully used artificial intelligence 
in manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed
100% of the time.

**Transcript**:
If you can't imagine
life without chocolate, you're lucky you weren't born before
the 16th century. Until then, chocolate only existed
in Mesoamerica in a form quite different 
from what we know. As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground and mixed with cornmeal
and chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction
frothing with foam. And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat. They believed that cacao
was a heavenly food gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward
for success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic
chocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited
the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink
brought out and poured into golden cups. When the colonists returned with shipments
of the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts
of native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac. At first, its bitter taste made it
suitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey,
sugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy
in the Spanish court. And soon, no aristocratic home was
complete without dedicated chocolate ware. The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce on a large scale. That involved using plantations
and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa. The world of chocolate would change
forever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press
by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate
we know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required
more cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator. Now, instead of African slaves 
being shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015. Yet along with the growth
of the industry, there have been horrific abuses
of human rights. Many of the plantations throughout
West Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected. This is a complex problem
that persists despite efforts from major chocolate
companies to partner with African nations to reduce child 
and indentured labor practices. Today, chocolate has established itself
in the rituals of our modern culture. Due to its colonial association with
native cultures, combined with the power of advertising, chocolate retains an aura
of something sensual, decadent, and forbidden. Yet knowing more about its fascinating
and often cruel history, as well as its production today, tells us where 
these associations originate and what they hide. So as you unwrap 
your next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that
not everything about chocolate is sweet.

**Transcript**:
If you can't imagine
life without chocolate, you're lucky you weren't born before
the 16th century. Until then, chocolate only existed
in Mesoamerica in a form quite different 
from what we know. As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned
to prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records tell us the beans
were ground and mixed with cornmeal
and chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction
frothing with foam. And if you thought we make
a big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat. They believed that cacao
was a heavenly food gifted to humans
by a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward
for success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic
chocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited
the court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink
brought out and poured into golden cups. When the colonists returned with shipments
of the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts
of native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac. At first, its bitter taste made it
suitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey,
sugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy
in the Spanish court. And soon, no aristocratic home was
complete without dedicated chocolate ware. The fashionable drink was difficult
and time consuming to produce on a large scale. That involved using plantations
and imported slave labor in the Caribbean and 
on islands off the coast of Africa. The world of chocolate would change
forever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press
by Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate
the cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed
into a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate
we know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier
named Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate
was no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required
more cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator. Now, instead of African slaves 
being shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift
to West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths
of the world's cocoa as of 2015. Yet along with the growth
of the industry, there have been horrific abuses
of human rights. Many of the plantations throughout
West Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than
2 million children affected. This is a complex problem
that persists despite efforts from major chocolate
companies to partner with African nations to reduce child 
and indentured labor practices. Today, chocolate has established itself
in the rituals of our modern culture. Due to its colonial association with
native cultures, combined with the power of advertising, chocolate retains an aura
of something sensual, decadent, and forbidden. Yet knowing more about its fascinating
and often cruel history, as well as its production today, tells us where 
these associations originate and what they hide. So as you unwrap 
your next bar of chocolate, take a moment to consider that
not everything about chocolate is sweet.

**Transcript**:
Imagine that one day,
you're summoned before a government panel. Even though you haven't 
committed any crime, or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned
about your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends
and associates. If you don't cooperate,
you risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in
the United States in the 1950s as part of a campaign to expose
suspected communists. Named after its most 
notorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism
destroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political 
leaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small
communist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider 
progressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American 
Communist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized
its ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. During World War II, when the USA
and USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually
spied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated
and this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen
as a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest lasting
and most widespread episode of political repression 
in American history. Spurred on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated
the danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding 
left-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against
nuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Starting in the late 1940s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency
to hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any
position of influence within American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover
and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public
and private employers were imposing the same political tests
on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted 
its own witchhunt subpoenaing hundreds of people
to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American 
Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate,
they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly, fired and blacklisted. Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, used such hearings as a partisan weapon accusing democrats 
of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China
to the Communist Bloc. McCarthy, a Republican senator 
from Wisconsin became notorious by flaunting
ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Egged on by other politicians, he continued to make 
outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy
while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out,
McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee
on investigations in 1953, McCarthy recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that 
finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues 
in the Senate censured him and he died less than three years later,
probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds, 
if not thousands, of lives and drastically narrowed the American
political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions
would be long lasting. In all likelihood, there were both
Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist
purges were deeply unjust but feared that directly opposing them
would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed
to stop the witchhunt, condoning serious violations
of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual
threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme
that it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared
in uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities
in the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?

and his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public
and private employers were imposing the same political tests
on the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted 
its own witchhunt subpoenaing hundreds of people
to testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American 
Activities Committee. If they refused to cooperate,
they could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly, fired and blacklisted. Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, used such hearings as a partisan weapon accusing democrats 
of being soft on communism and deliberately losing China
to the Communist Bloc. McCarthy, a Republican senator 
from Wisconsin became notorious by flaunting
ever-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Egged on by other politicians, he continued to make 
outrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy
while others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out,
McCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee
on investigations in 1953, McCarthy recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that 
finally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues 
in the Senate censured him and he died less than three years later,
probably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds, 
if not thousands, of lives and drastically narrowed the American
political spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions
would be long lasting. In all likelihood, there were both
Democrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist
purges were deeply unjust but feared that directly opposing them
would hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed
to stop the witchhunt, condoning serious violations
of constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual
threat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme
that it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared
in uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities
in the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Dating back at least 
to the time of Socrates, some early societies decided
that certain disputes, such as whether a person committed
a particular crime, should be heard by a group of citizens. Several centuries later, trial by jury
was introduced to England, where it became a fundamental feature
of the legal system, checking the government 
and involving citizens in decision-making. Juries decided whether defendants
would be tried on crimes, determined whether the accused
defendants were guilty, and resolved monetary disputes. While the American colonies eventually
cast off England's rule, its legal tradition of the jury persisted. The United States Constitution 
instructed a grand jury to decide whether 
criminal cases proceeded, required a jury to try all crimes,
except impeachment, and provided for juries 
in civil cases as well. Yet, in the US today,
grand juries often are not convened, and juries decide less than 4%
of criminal cases and less than 1% of civil cases
filed in court. That's at the same time as jury systems
in other countries are growing. So what happened in the U.S.? Part of the story lies in how the Supreme
Court has interpreted the Constitution. It's permitted plea bargaining, which now occurs in almost 
every criminal case. The way it works is the prosecutor
presents the accused with a decision of whether 
to plead guilty. If they accept the plea, the case won't
go in front of a jury, but they'll receive 
a shorter prison sentence than they'd get if 
a jury did convict them. The risk of a much greater 
prison sentence after a trial can frighten even an innocent defendant
into taking a plea. Between the 19th century 
and the 21st century, the proportion of guilty pleas
has increased from around 20% to 90%, and the numbers continue to grow. The Supreme Court has permitted
the use of another procedure that interferes with the jury called summary judgement. Using summary judgement, judges can
decide that civil trials are unnecessary if the people who sue 
have insufficient evidence. This is intended only for cases
where no reasonable jury would disagree. That's a difficult thing 
to determine, yet usage of summary judgement
has stretched to the point where some would argue it's being abused. For instance, judges grant fully,
or in part, over 70% of employers' requests to dismiss employment 
discrimination cases. In other cases, both the person who sues
and the person who defends forgo their right to go to court, instead resolving their dispute through
a professional arbitrator. These are generally lawyers, professors,
or former judges. Arbitration can be a smart decision
by both parties to avoid the requirements 
of a trial in court, but it's often agreed to unwittingly
when people sign contracts like employment applications
and consumer agreements. That can become a problem. For example, some arbitrators 
may be biased towards the companies
that give them cases. These are just some of the ways
in which juries have disappeared. But could the disappearance of juries
be a good thing? Well, juries aren't perfect. They're costly, time-consuming, and may make errors. And they're not always necessary, like when people can simply agree
to settle their disputes. But juries have their advantages. When properly selected, jurors are more representative of
the general population and don't have the same incentives
as prosecutors, legislators, or judges seeking reelection or promotion. The founders of the United States trusted
in the wisdom of impartial groups of citizens to check the power of all three branches
of government. And the jury trial itself has given
ordinary citizens a central role in upholding
the social fabric. So will the jury system in the U.S.
survive into the future?

**Transcript**:
Dating back at least 
to the time of Socrates, some early societies decided
that certain disputes, such as whether a person committed
a particular crime, should be heard by a group of citizens. Several centuries later, trial by jury
was introduced to England, where it became a fundamental feature
of the legal system, checking the government 
and involving citizens in decision-making. Juries decided whether defendants
would be tried on crimes, determined whether the accused
defendants were guilty, and resolved monetary disputes. While the American colonies eventually
cast off England's rule, its legal tradition of the jury persisted. The United States Constitution 
instructed a grand jury to decide whether 
criminal cases proceeded, required a jury to try all crimes,
except impeachment, and provided for juries 
in civil cases as well. Yet, in the US today,
grand juries often are not convened, and juries decide less than 4%
of criminal cases and less than 1% of civil cases
filed in court. That's at the same time as jury systems
in other countries are growing. So what happened in the U.S.? Part of the story lies in how the Supreme
Court has interpreted the Constitution. It's permitted plea bargaining, which now occurs in almost 
every criminal case. The way it works is the prosecutor
presents the accused with a decision of whether 
to plead guilty. If they accept the plea, the case won't
go in front of a jury, but they'll receive 
a shorter prison sentence than they'd get if 
a jury did convict them. The risk of a much greater 
prison sentence after a trial can frighten even an innocent defendant
into taking a plea. Between the 19th century 
and the 21st century, the proportion of guilty pleas
has increased from around 20% to 90%, and the numbers continue to grow. The Supreme Court has permitted
the use of another procedure that interferes with the jury called summary judgement. Using summary judgement, judges can
decide that civil trials are unnecessary if the people who sue 
have insufficient evidence. This is intended only for cases
where no reasonable jury would disagree. That's a difficult thing 
to determine, yet usage of summary judgement
has stretched to the point where some would argue it's being abused. For instance, judges grant fully,
or in part, over 70% of employers' requests to dismiss employment 
discrimination cases. In other cases, both the person who sues
and the person who defends forgo their right to go to court, instead resolving their dispute through
a professional arbitrator. These are generally lawyers, professors,
or former judges. Arbitration can be a smart decision
by both parties to avoid the requirements 
of a trial in court, but it's often agreed to unwittingly
when people sign contracts like employment applications
and consumer agreements. That can become a problem. For example, some arbitrators 
may be biased towards the companies
that give them cases. These are just some of the ways
in which juries have disappeared. But could the disappearance of juries
be a good thing? Well, juries aren't perfect. They're costly, time-consuming, and may make errors. And they're not always necessary, like when people can simply agree
to settle their disputes. But juries have their advantages. When properly selected, jurors are more representative of
the general population and don't have the same incentives
as prosecutors, legislators, or judges seeking reelection or promotion. The founders of the United States trusted
in the wisdom of impartial groups of citizens to check the power of all three branches
of government. And the jury trial itself has given
ordinary citizens a central role in upholding
the social fabric. So will the jury system in the U.S.
survive into the future?

**Transcript**:
[PBSDS BUMPER] The average person gets rid of approximately 130 grams of poop every day. Maybe twice that much if they’ve had Taco
Bell. Seven and a half billion of us on Earth? That’s a literal mountain of human poop
every day. Yet most of *us* get to pretend it doesn’t
exist, all thanks to an invention that has improved health and quality of life more than
any other in humanity’s history. [OPEN BUMPER] Bears do it in the woods, whales do it in the ocean, and 2.4 *billion* of us DON’T
do it in a toilet. Dysentery, typhoid, parasites, and other infections
lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, all because one in three people alive
in 2017 don’t have access to toilets and latrines. From on top of our porcelain thrones, we’ve
left a lot of our species drowning in feces. Nearly a *billion* people still defecate out
in the open: in street gutters, open water, or… in the woods. Thousands of years ago, we all did it that
way, but as we developed agriculture and settled into towns, poop started piling up. Around five thousand years ago, Neolithic
villagers constructed the first known toilets at Skara Brae. At the same time, many houses in Mohenjo Daro,
featured toilets complete with drains, people washed their poop into sewers that emptied
into the Indus River. It’d be thousands of years before we linked
germs to disease, but avoiding filth has deep evolutionary roots. Bodily excretions, death, and rotten smells
can be signs of danger or disease, triggering our innate sense of disgust. This biological instinct ended up in the moral
codes of many religions, like this passage from the Old Testament instructing the Hebrews
to do their Exodus in a… hole-y fashion. Roman society was comfortable with caca. At one point, Rome had 144 public toilets…
long open benches that emptied into the Cloaca Maxima, a sewer system that carried waste
to the Tiber river. But the vast majority of Romans simply pooped
in a pot and threw it into the street. As waste and disease piled up, Romans pointed
to the stink as the cause of sickness. After the Roman Empire faded away, this connection
between bad air and bad health persisted, clogging up toilet innovation for more than
a thousand years. During medieval outbreaks like the Plague,
doctors wore pointed masks, filled with strong herbs or perfumes to “cleanse” bad air,
which they believed to be the cause of disease. They were wrong, but this obsession with stink
would change the world in ways no one saw coming. Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper
didn’t invent the flush toilet. That honor goes to John Harington, his “Ajax”
device emptied the bowl with water from an overhead tank. But flush toilets didn’t catch on until
1775, when Alexander Cummings revolutionized the way we poo by adding a water-filled “S
trap” to block explosive, and supposedly disease-causing sewer gas from rising up the
pipes, the same basic toilet design we still use today. During the Industrial Revolution, most people’s
business still ended up in streets and cesspools, and the growing population was too big a load
for London’s sewers. By the mid-1800s, the city was literally overflowing
with crap. With crap comes cholera, an infection from
bacteria whose toxins basically cause all the water in your body to pour out of your
butt in the form of diarrhea, death by dehydration. Cholera hit London in 1854. Instead of the “old bad air” theory, a
doctor named John Snow believed cholera was transmitted by drinking water tainted with
sewage. Snow’s map of cholera cases clustered around
a water pump. When he when he removed the pump’s handle,
new cholera cases fell. Soon after, London enclosed its sewers and
diverted waste downstream of London, but doctors wouldn’t totally accept Snow’s ideas for
nearly 50 years. The Great Depression saw an expansion of sewage
treatment plants–and modern toilet paper!–and this is basically the sanitation system we
have today, where magical chairs make nasty things disappear, out of sight, out of smell,
and out of mind. It’s no three sea shells but we've come a long way. …and this privileged pooping existence lets
us keep something else out of mind: The 2.4 BILLION people who still don’t have toilets. Nearly 800,000 children under 5 still die
every year from diarrhea. More than AIDS, more than malaria. That’s an Airbus A380 full of children crashing
every 6 hours. It’s estimated last year poor sanitation
cost the global economy $260 billion, due to illness, loss of income, and years of life
lost. Worse, women suffer these impacts disproportionately
to men. In 2007, readers of the BMJ voted “modern
sanitation” as the #1 medical advance since 1840. Not antibiotics, not vaccines. Toilets and clean water. We *have* made progress. Since 1990, 14% more people have access to
sanitation, and *many* fewer are dying, but fewer is not zero. With a little effort, we can *wipe* this problem
from the Earth. On the TV show “The Brady Bunch”, their
bathroom didn’t even have a toilet. Pooping is so taboo, it was *literally* invisible. We can’t even talk about it! It’s no coincidence that many of our worst
swear words involve defecation. In her book The Big Necessity, Rose George
writes: “How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats
its humans too” Everybody poops, and every person who is born
should be able to do it safely. Stay curious! And please… always wash your hands when you’re done. Hey everyone, as always, thank you for watching
and learning with us. This week’s video was a stinky but important
subject, and it was brought to you thanks to the support of Bill and Melinda Gates. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates have supported
efforts around the world to make people healthier and make their lives better through innovation,
education, and investing in projects to build a better future. And it’s working! Since 1990, an estimated **122 million** children’s
lives have been saved, thanks to things like better nutrition, family planning, economic
opportunities, and vaccines. Here’s some proof: In 1988 there were more
than 350,000 cases of polio. And last year? Only 34. Things have gotten a LOT better, and one day
soon, that number *can be, and will be zero*. But whether it’s bringing toilets to 2.4
billion people, or erasing the last few cases of polio, progress only happens when the privileged
pay attention. Go to gatesletter.com to read Bill and Melinda
Gates’ Annual Letter, and find out all the ways life has and will continue to improve
for the world’s poorest I’ll see you next time.

**Transcript**:
[PBSDS BUMPER] The average person gets rid of approximately 130 grams of poop every day. Maybe twice that much if they’ve had Taco
Bell. Seven and a half billion of us on Earth? That’s a literal mountain of human poop
every day. Yet most of *us* get to pretend it doesn’t
exist, all thanks to an invention that has improved health and quality of life more than
any other in humanity’s history. [OPEN BUMPER] Bears do it in the woods, whales do it in the ocean, and 2.4 *billion* of us DON’T
do it in a toilet. Dysentery, typhoid, parasites, and other infections
lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, all because one in three people alive
in 2017 don’t have access to toilets and latrines. From on top of our porcelain thrones, we’ve
left a lot of our species drowning in feces. Nearly a *billion* people still defecate out
in the open: in street gutters, open water, or… in the woods. Thousands of years ago, we all did it that
way, but as we developed agriculture and settled into towns, poop started piling up. Around five thousand years ago, Neolithic
villagers constructed the first known toilets at Skara Brae. At the same time, many houses in Mohenjo Daro,
featured toilets complete with drains, people washed their poop into sewers that emptied
into the Indus River. It’d be thousands of years before we linked
germs to disease, but avoiding filth has deep evolutionary roots. Bodily excretions, death, and rotten smells
can be signs of danger or disease, triggering our innate sense of disgust. This biological instinct ended up in the moral
codes of many religions, like this passage from the Old Testament instructing the Hebrews
to do their Exodus in a… hole-y fashion. Roman society was comfortable with caca. At one point, Rome had 144 public toilets…
long open benches that emptied into the Cloaca Maxima, a sewer system that carried waste
to the Tiber river. But the vast majority of Romans simply pooped
in a pot and threw it into the street. As waste and disease piled up, Romans pointed
to the stink as the cause of sickness. After the Roman Empire faded away, this connection
between bad air and bad health persisted, clogging up toilet innovation for more than
a thousand years. During medieval outbreaks like the Plague,
doctors wore pointed masks, filled with strong herbs or perfumes to “cleanse” bad air,
which they believed to be the cause of disease. They were wrong, but this obsession with stink
would change the world in ways no one saw coming. Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper
didn’t invent the flush toilet. That honor goes to John Harington, his “Ajax”
device emptied the bowl with water from an overhead tank. But flush toilets didn’t catch on until
1775, when Alexander Cummings revolutionized the way we poo by adding a water-filled “S
trap” to block explosive, and supposedly disease-causing sewer gas from rising up the
pipes, the same basic toilet design we still use today. During the Industrial Revolution, most people’s
business still ended up in streets and cesspools, and the growing population was too big a load
for London’s sewers. By the mid-1800s, the city was literally overflowing
with crap. With crap comes cholera, an infection from
bacteria whose toxins basically cause all the water in your body to pour out of your
butt in the form of diarrhea, death by dehydration. Cholera hit London in 1854. Instead of the “old bad air” theory, a
doctor named John Snow believed cholera was transmitted by drinking water tainted with
sewage. Snow’s map of cholera cases clustered around
a water pump. When he when he removed the pump’s handle,
new cholera cases fell. Soon after, London enclosed its sewers and
diverted waste downstream of London, but doctors wouldn’t totally accept Snow’s ideas for
nearly 50 years. The Great Depression saw an expansion of sewage
treatment plants–and modern toilet paper!–and this is basically the sanitation system we
have today, where magical chairs make nasty things disappear, out of sight, out of smell,
and out of mind. It’s no three sea shells but we've come a long way. …and this privileged pooping existence lets
us keep something else out of mind: The 2.4 BILLION people who still don’t have toilets. Nearly 800,000 children under 5 still die
every year from diarrhea. More than AIDS, more than malaria. That’s an Airbus A380 full of children crashing
every 6 hours. It’s estimated last year poor sanitation
cost the global economy $260 billion, due to illness, loss of income, and years of life
lost. Worse, women suffer these impacts disproportionately
to men. In 2007, readers of the BMJ voted “modern
sanitation” as the #1 medical advance since 1840. Not antibiotics, not vaccines. Toilets and clean water. We *have* made progress. Since 1990, 14% more people have access to
sanitation, and *many* fewer are dying, but fewer is not zero. With a little effort, we can *wipe* this problem
from the Earth. On the TV show “The Brady Bunch”, their
bathroom didn’t even have a toilet. Pooping is so taboo, it was *literally* invisible. We can’t even talk about it! It’s no coincidence that many of our worst
swear words involve defecation. In her book The Big Necessity, Rose George
writes: “How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats
its humans too” Everybody poops, and every person who is born

**Transcript**:
Approximately 7 million people around the 
world die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other
problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack,
it can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls 
of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn
into blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it
in minutes, and a partially closed artery
can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off 
to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate
in the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able
to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario,
a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone
is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived 
heart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic
as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent
in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be 
having a heart attack, the most important thing 
is to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical
services, call them. They're the fastest way 
to get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, 
which opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack
from getting worse. In the emergency room, 
doctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's 
electrical activity and a blood test to assess 
heart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech
cardiac suite where tests are done 
to locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen 
the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon
in a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal
or polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require
coronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery
from another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow
around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation
to the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors
both affect your risk. And the good news is that you can
change your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet,
and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising
a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity
and strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low
in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts
and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also
keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower 
your heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose
aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've
already had a heart attack and for those known to be
at high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol,
and diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, 
but they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep
and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure
your body's most important muscle keeps on beating.

Approximately 7 million people around the 
world die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other
problems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack,
it can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls 
of our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn
into blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it
in minutes, and a partially closed artery
can become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off 
to the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate
in the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able
to pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario,
a heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone
is having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived 
heart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic
as it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent
in women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be 
having a heart attack, the most important thing 
is to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical
services, call them. They're the fastest way 
to get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, 
which opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack
from getting worse. In the emergency room, 
doctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's 
electrical activity and a blood test to assess 
heart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech
cardiac suite where tests are done 
to locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen 
the blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon
in a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal
or polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require
coronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery
from another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow
around the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation
to the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors
both affect your risk. And the good news is that you can
change your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet,
and weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising
a few times a week, doing both aerobic activity
and strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low
in sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts
and almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also
keep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower 
your heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose
aspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've
already had a heart attack and for those known to be
at high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol,
and diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, 
but they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep
and lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure
your body's most important muscle keeps on beating.

**Transcript**:
In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope
at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper, a spot that was dark and out of the way
of light pollution from surrounding stars. The location was apparently empty,
and the whole endeavor was risky. What, if anything, was going to show up? Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours
of exposure of that same area. And what came back 
was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver 
of the universe. Now, let's take a step back to understand
the scale of this image. If you were to take a ballpoint pen and hold it at arm's length 
in front of the night sky, focusing on its very tip, that is what the Hubble Telescope captured
in its first Deep Field image. In other words, those 3,000 galaxies were seen 
in just a tiny speck of the universe, approximately one two-millionth
of the night sky. To put all this in perspective, the average human measures
about 1.7 meters. With Earth's diameter 
at 12,700 kilometers, that's nearly 7.5 million humans
lined up head to toe. The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance
of 380,000 kilometers to the moon. And our relatively small Sun has a
diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, or 110 times the Earth's diameter. A step further, the Milky Way holds somewhere 
between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured
in the Deep Field image contains billions of stars
at the very least. Almost a decade after taking
the Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics
on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure
over a period of about four months. This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies. Half of these galaxies have since been
analyzed more clearly in what's known as 
the eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years 
of photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only 
one ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe
from the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time
are inextricably linked. That's because of 
the finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like
time machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies
that existed over 13 billion years ago. This means we're looking
at the universe as it was less than a billion years 
after the Big Bang, and it allows scientists to research
galaxies in their infancy. The Deep Field images have also shown
that the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different
spots in the sky look similar. That's incredible when we think about

**Transcript**:
In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope
at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper, a spot that was dark and out of the way
of light pollution from surrounding stars. The location was apparently empty,
and the whole endeavor was risky. What, if anything, was going to show up? Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours
of exposure of that same area. And what came back 
was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver 
of the universe. Now, let's take a step back to understand
the scale of this image. If you were to take a ballpoint pen and hold it at arm's length 
in front of the night sky, focusing on its very tip, that is what the Hubble Telescope captured
in its first Deep Field image. In other words, those 3,000 galaxies were seen 
in just a tiny speck of the universe, approximately one two-millionth
of the night sky. To put all this in perspective, the average human measures
about 1.7 meters. With Earth's diameter 
at 12,700 kilometers, that's nearly 7.5 million humans
lined up head to toe. The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance
of 380,000 kilometers to the moon. And our relatively small Sun has a
diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, or 110 times the Earth's diameter. A step further, the Milky Way holds somewhere 
between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured
in the Deep Field image contains billions of stars
at the very least. Almost a decade after taking
the Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics
on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure
over a period of about four months. This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies. Half of these galaxies have since been
analyzed more clearly in what's known as 
the eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years 
of photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only 
one ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe
from the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time
are inextricably linked. That's because of 
the finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like
time machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies
that existed over 13 billion years ago. This means we're looking
at the universe as it was less than a billion years 
after the Big Bang, and it allows scientists to research
galaxies in their infancy. The Deep Field images have also shown
that the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different
spots in the sky look similar. That's incredible when we think about
how vast the universe is. Why would we expect it to be the same
across such huge distances? On the scale of a galaxy, 
let alone the universe, we're smaller than 
we can readily comprehend, but we do have the capacity to wonder, to question, to explore, to investigate, and to imagine. So the next time you stand gazing up

**Transcript**:
Will winning the lottery make you happier? Imagine winning a multi-million dollar
lottery tomorrow. If you're like many of us,
you'd be ecstatic, unable to believe your good luck. But would that joy still be there
a few years later? Maybe not. A famous study of 22 lottery winners
showed that months after winning, their average reported levels of happiness
had increased no more than that of a control group 
who hadn't won the lottery. Some were actually unhappier
than they had been before winning. And later studies have confirmed that
our emotional well-being, how often and how intensely 
we feel things like joy, sorrow, anxiety, or anger, don't seem to improve with wealth
or status beyond a certain point. This has to do with a phenomenon
known as hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill. It describes our tendency to adapt
to new situations to maintain a stable 
emotional equilibrium. When it comes to feeling happy, most of us seem to have a base level that
stays more or less constant throughout our existence. Of course, the novelty of better food, superior vacations, and more beautiful homes can at first make you feel like you're
walking on air, but as you get used to those things, you revert to your 
default emotional state. That might sound pretty gloomy, but hedonic adaptation makes us 
less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change, including negative ones. The study with the lottery winners also looked at people who had suffered 
an accident that left them paralyzed. When asked several months after
their accidents how happy they were, they reported levels of happiness
approaching their original baseline. So while the hedonic treadmill may
inhibit our enjoyment of positive changes, it seems to also enable our resilience
in recovering from adversity. There are other reasons 
that winning the lottery may not make us happier in the long run. It can be difficult to manage
large sums of money, and some lottery winners wind up
spending or losing it all quickly. It can also be socially isolating. Some winners experience a deluge of
unwelcome requests for money, so they wind up cutting themselves off
from others. And wealth may actually make us meaner. In one study, participants played
a rigged game of monopoly where the experimenters made
some players rich quickly. The wealthy players started
patronizing the poorer players and hogging the snacks 
they were meant to share. But just because a huge influx of cash isn't guaranteed to bring 
joy into your life doesn't mean that money 
can never make us happier. Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic
and material things, like a new car or a bigger house, much faster than we do 
to novel experiences, like visiting a new place
or learning a new skill. So by that reasoning, the more you spend money
on experiences rather than things, the happier you'd be. And there's another way to turn
your money into happiness: spend it on other people. In one study, participants were
given some money and were either asked to spend it
on themselves or on someone else. Later that evening, researchers called up
these participants and asked them how happy they were. The happiness levels of those who had
spent the money on others were significantly greater than that
of those who had spent it on themselves. And that seems to be true 
around the world. Another study examined the generosity
of over 200,000 people from 136 countries. In over 90% of these countries, people who donated tended to be happier
than those who didn't. But this may all be easier said than done. Let's say a million dollars 
falls into your lap tomorrow. What do you do with it?

**Transcript**:
Will winning the lottery make you happier? Imagine winning a multi-million dollar
lottery tomorrow. If you're like many of us,
you'd be ecstatic, unable to believe your good luck. But would that joy still be there
a few years later? Maybe not. A famous study of 22 lottery winners
showed that months after winning, their average reported levels of happiness
had increased no more than that of a control group 
who hadn't won the lottery. Some were actually unhappier
than they had been before winning. And later studies have confirmed that
our emotional well-being, how often and how intensely 
we feel things like joy, sorrow, anxiety, or anger, don't seem to improve with wealth
or status beyond a certain point. This has to do with a phenomenon
known as hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill. It describes our tendency to adapt
to new situations to maintain a stable 
emotional equilibrium. When it comes to feeling happy, most of us seem to have a base level that
stays more or less constant throughout our existence. Of course, the novelty of better food, superior vacations, and more beautiful homes can at first make you feel like you're
walking on air, but as you get used to those things, you revert to your 
default emotional state. That might sound pretty gloomy, but hedonic adaptation makes us 
less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change, including negative ones. The study with the lottery winners also looked at people who had suffered 
an accident that left them paralyzed. When asked several months after
their accidents how happy they were, they reported levels of happiness
approaching their original baseline. So while the hedonic treadmill may
inhibit our enjoyment of positive changes, it seems to also enable our resilience
in recovering from adversity. There are other reasons 
that winning the lottery may not make us happier in the long run. It can be difficult to manage
large sums of money, and some lottery winners wind up
spending or losing it all quickly. It can also be socially isolating. Some winners experience a deluge of
unwelcome requests for money, so they wind up cutting themselves off
from others. And wealth may actually make us meaner. In one study, participants played
a rigged game of monopoly where the experimenters made
some players rich quickly. The wealthy players started
patronizing the poorer players and hogging the snacks 
they were meant to share. But just because a huge influx of cash isn't guaranteed to bring 
joy into your life doesn't mean that money 
can never make us happier. Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic
and material things, like a new car or a bigger house, much faster than we do 
to novel experiences, like visiting a new place
or learning a new skill. So by that reasoning, the more you spend money
on experiences rather than things, the happier you'd be. And there's another way to turn
your money into happiness: spend it on other people. In one study, participants were
given some money and were either asked to spend it
on themselves or on someone else. Later that evening, researchers called up
these participants and asked them how happy they were. The happiness levels of those who had
spent the money on others were significantly greater than that
of those who had spent it on themselves. And that seems to be true 
around the world. Another study examined the generosity
of over 200,000 people from 136 countries. In over 90% of these countries, people who donated tended to be happier
than those who didn't. But this may all be easier said than done. Let's say a million dollars 
falls into your lap tomorrow. What do you do with it?

**Transcript**:
A close encounter with
a man-eating giant, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, a long-lost king taking back his throne. On their own, any of these make
great stories, but each is just one episode
in the "Odyssey," a 12,000-line poem spanning years of
Ancient Greek history, myth, and legend. How do we make sense 
of such a massive text that comes from and tells of a world
so far away? The fact that we can read the "Odyssey"
at all is pretty incredible, as it was composed before the Greek
alphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE. It was made for listeners 
rather than readers, and was performed by oral poets
called rhapsodes. Tradition identifies its author
as a blind man named Homer. But no one definitively knows whether
he was real or legendary. The earliest mentions of him occur
centuries after his era. And the poems attributed to him
seem to have been changed and rearranged many times
by multiple authors before finally being written down
in their current form. In fact, the word rhapsode means
stitching together, as these poets combined existing stories,
jokes, myths, and songs into a single narrative. To recite these massive epics live, rhapsodes employed a steady meter, along with mnemonic devices, like repetition of memorized passages
or set pieces. These included descriptions of scenery
and lists of characters, and helped the rhapsode keep
their place in the narrative, just as the chorus or bridge of a song
helps us to remember the next verses. Because most of the tales were familiar
to the audience, it was common to hear the sections
of the poem out of order. At some point, the order 
became set in stone and the story was locked into place
as the one we read today. But since the world has changed
a bit in the last several thousand years, it helps to have some background
before jumping in. The "Odyssey" itself is a sequel to Homer's
other famous epic, the "Iliad," which tells the story of the Trojan War. If there's one major theme uniting
both poems, it's this: do not, under any circumstances,
incur the wrath of the gods. The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix
of divine power and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges
of epic proportions. And many of the problems faced by humans
in the poems are caused by their hubris, or excessive pride in believing themselves
superior to the gods. The desire to please the gods was so great that the Ancient Greeks traditionally
welcomed all strangers into their homes with generosity for fear that the strangers 
might be gods in disguise. This ancient code of hospitality
was called xenia. It involved hosts providing their guests
with safety, food, and comfort, and the guests returning the favor
with courtesy and gifts if they had them. Xenia has a significant role 
in the "Odyssey," where Odysseus in his wanderings
is the perpetual guest, while in his absence, his clever wife
Penelope plays non-stop host. The "Odyssey" recounts all 
of Odysseus's years of travel, but the narrative begins in medias res
in the middle of things. Ten years after the Trojan War,
we find our hero trapped on an island, still far from his native Ithaca and
the family he hasn't seen for 20 years. Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon
by blinding his son, a cyclops, Odysseus's passage home has been
fraught with mishap after mishap. With trouble brewing at home
and gods discussing his fate, Odysseus begins the account
of those missing years to his hosts. One of the most fascinating things
about the "Odyssey" is the gap between how little we know
about its time period and the wealth of detail the text
itself contains. Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries 
searching for the ruins of Troy and identifying which islands
Odysseus visited. Just like its hero, the 24-book epic

**Transcript**:
A close encounter with
a man-eating giant, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, a long-lost king taking back his throne. On their own, any of these make
great stories, but each is just one episode
in the "Odyssey," a 12,000-line poem spanning years of
Ancient Greek history, myth, and legend. How do we make sense 
of such a massive text that comes from and tells of a world
so far away? The fact that we can read the "Odyssey"
at all is pretty incredible, as it was composed before the Greek
alphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE. It was made for listeners 
rather than readers, and was performed by oral poets
called rhapsodes. Tradition identifies its author
as a blind man named Homer. But no one definitively knows whether
he was real or legendary. The earliest mentions of him occur
centuries after his era. And the poems attributed to him
seem to have been changed and rearranged many times
by multiple authors before finally being written down
in their current form. In fact, the word rhapsode means
stitching together, as these poets combined existing stories,
jokes, myths, and songs into a single narrative. To recite these massive epics live, rhapsodes employed a steady meter, along with mnemonic devices, like repetition of memorized passages
or set pieces. These included descriptions of scenery
and lists of characters, and helped the rhapsode keep
their place in the narrative, just as the chorus or bridge of a song
helps us to remember the next verses. Because most of the tales were familiar
to the audience, it was common to hear the sections
of the poem out of order. At some point, the order 
became set in stone and the story was locked into place
as the one we read today. But since the world has changed
a bit in the last several thousand years, it helps to have some background
before jumping in. The "Odyssey" itself is a sequel to Homer's
other famous epic, the "Iliad," which tells the story of the Trojan War. If there's one major theme uniting
both poems, it's this: do not, under any circumstances,
incur the wrath of the gods. The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix
of divine power and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges
of epic proportions. And many of the problems faced by humans
in the poems are caused by their hubris, or excessive pride in believing themselves
superior to the gods. The desire to please the gods was so great that the Ancient Greeks traditionally
welcomed all strangers into their homes with generosity for fear that the strangers 
might be gods in disguise. This ancient code of hospitality
was called xenia. It involved hosts providing their guests
with safety, food, and comfort, and the guests returning the favor
with courtesy and gifts if they had them. Xenia has a significant role 
in the "Odyssey," where Odysseus in his wanderings
is the perpetual guest, while in his absence, his clever wife
Penelope plays non-stop host. The "Odyssey" recounts all 
of Odysseus's years of travel, but the narrative begins in medias res
in the middle of things. Ten years after the Trojan War,
we find our hero trapped on an island, still far from his native Ithaca and
the family he hasn't seen for 20 years. Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon
by blinding his son, a cyclops, Odysseus's passage home has been
fraught with mishap after mishap. With trouble brewing at home
and gods discussing his fate, Odysseus begins the account
of those missing years to his hosts. One of the most fascinating things
about the "Odyssey" is the gap between how little we know
about its time period and the wealth of detail the text
itself contains. Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries 
searching for the ruins of Troy and identifying which islands
Odysseus visited. Just like its hero, the 24-book epic
has made its own long journey through centuries of myth and history to tell us its incredible story today.
