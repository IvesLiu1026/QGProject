Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
As of 2018, there are around 
2.5 billion smartphone users in the world. If we broke open all their newest phones, which are just a fraction 
of the total that’ve been built, and split them into their component parts, that would produce 
around 85,000 kilograms of gold, 875,000 of silver, and 40 million kilograms of copper. How did this precious cache 
get into our phones, and can we reclaim it? Gold, silver, and copper 
are actually just a few of the 70 or so chemical elements 
that make up the average smartphone. These can be divided 
into different groups, two of the most critical 
being rare earth elements and precious metals. Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements
that are actually common in Earth’s crust and are found in many areas across 
the world in low concentrations. These elements have a huge
range of magnetic, phosphorescent, and conductive properties that make them crucial 
to modern technologies. In fact, of the 17 types 
of rare earth metals, phones and other electronics 
may contain up to 16. In smartphones, these create the screen 
and color display, aid conductivity, and produce the signature vibrations, amongst other things. And yet, crucial as they are, extracting these elements from the earth is linked to some disturbing 
environmental impacts. Rare earth elements can often be found, but in many areas, it’s not economically feasible 
to extract them due to low concentrations. Much of the time, extracting them requires 
a method called open pit mining that exposes vast areas of land. This form of mining destroys 
huge swaths of natural habitats, and causes air and water pollution, threatening the health 
of nearby communities. Another group of ingredients 
in smartphones comes with similar environmental risks: these are metals such as copper, silver, palladium, aluminum, platinum, tungsten, tin, lead, and gold. We also mine magnesium, lithium, silica, and potassium to make phones, and all of it is associated 
with vast habitat destruction, as well as air and water pollution. Mining comes with 
worrying social problems, too, like large-scale human 
and animal displacement to make way for industrial operations, and frequently, 
poor working conditions for laborers. Lastly, phone production 
also requires petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. That entwines our smartphones inextricably
with this growing planetary conundrum. And, what’s more, the ingredients we mine 
to make our phones aren’t infinite. One day, they’ll simply run out, and we haven’t yet discovered effective 
replacements for some. Despite this, the number of smartphones 
is on a steady increase; by 2019 it’s predicted that 
there’ll be close to 3 billion in use. This means that reclaiming the bounty 
within our phones is swiftly becoming a necessity. So, if you have an old phone, you might want to consider your options 
before throwing it away. To minimize waste, you could donate it 
to a charity for reuse, take it to an e-waste recycling facility, or look for a company 
that refurbishes old models. However, even recycling companies 
need our scrutiny. Just as the production of smartphones comes with social 
and environmental problems, dismantling them does too. E-waste is sometimes intentionally 
exported to countries where labor is cheap 
but working conditions are poor. Vast workforces, 
often made up of women and children, may be underpaid, lack the training 
to safely disassemble phones, and be exposed to elements 
like lead and mercury, which can permanently damage 
their nervous systems. Phone waste can also end up 
in huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals 
into the soil and water, mirroring the problems of the mines 
where the elements originated. A phone is much more than it appears 
to be on the surface. It’s an assemblage of elements
from multiple countries, linked to impacts 
that are unfolding on a global scale. So, until someone invents 
a completely sustainable smartphone, we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology
affects widespread places and people.

in smartphones comes with similar environmental risks: these are metals such as copper, silver, palladium, aluminum, platinum, tungsten, tin, lead, and gold. We also mine magnesium, lithium, silica, and potassium to make phones, and all of it is associated 
with vast habitat destruction, as well as air and water pollution. Mining comes with 
worrying social problems, too, like large-scale human 
and animal displacement to make way for industrial operations, and frequently, 
poor working conditions for laborers. Lastly, phone production 
also requires petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. That entwines our smartphones inextricably
with this growing planetary conundrum. And, what’s more, the ingredients we mine 
to make our phones aren’t infinite. One day, they’ll simply run out, and we haven’t yet discovered effective 
replacements for some. Despite this, the number of smartphones 
is on a steady increase; by 2019 it’s predicted that 
there’ll be close to 3 billion in use. This means that reclaiming the bounty 
within our phones is swiftly becoming a necessity. So, if you have an old phone, you might want to consider your options 
before throwing it away. To minimize waste, you could donate it 
to a charity for reuse, take it to an e-waste recycling facility, or look for a company 
that refurbishes old models. However, even recycling companies 
need our scrutiny. Just as the production of smartphones comes with social 
and environmental problems, dismantling them does too. E-waste is sometimes intentionally 
exported to countries where labor is cheap 
but working conditions are poor. Vast workforces, 
often made up of women and children, may be underpaid, lack the training 
to safely disassemble phones, and be exposed to elements 
like lead and mercury, which can permanently damage 
their nervous systems. Phone waste can also end up 
in huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals 
into the soil and water, mirroring the problems of the mines 
where the elements originated. A phone is much more than it appears 
to be on the surface. It’s an assemblage of elements
from multiple countries, linked to impacts 
that are unfolding on a global scale. So, until someone invents 
a completely sustainable smartphone, we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology
affects widespread places and people.

want to think about this, but over 3500 species of cockroaches live on this planet. The good news? Only about 30 of those species have adapted to live around humans. The bad news? 30 species of cockroaches
can live around us! Roaches are one of the most
common pests in the US. So it's no surprise that humans are always trying to kill them. But no matter how many
times we stomp them, squash them, and bomb
them with toxic chemicals, these pesky pests always seem
to pop up time and time again. So what's going on? Let's take a closer look at the roach you probably know better than you'd like. Periplaneta Americana. Aka, the American Cockroach. But this name is misleading. This guy is actually
from Africa, not America. It made its way to the US by infesting boats in the 16th century, and it's been spreading to
almost every corner in the world ever since. It turns out, it's one of the largest
species of cockroach around. But that's not the only
big thing about it. New research has revealed
that it has a massive genome. One of the largest of any studied insect. And may of these genes are
exactly what make this roach a master survivor. Let's start with the genes associated with something called Chemoreception. That's how roaches smell
and taste their environment. Turns out they're actually way better at sniffing out and eating
food than most other insects. The American roach has 154
olfactory receptors for smell, and 544 gustatory receptors for taste. More than any other insect on the planet. As a result, these cockroaches
are not picky eaters. Sure, they like cheese, meat
and sugar like the rest of us, but they'll also go for
things like cardboard, book bindings, human
toenails, rotting meat, blood, excrement, and even each other. That's right, these
roaches have been known to eat other dead or crippled cockroaches, all in the name of survival. It sounds gross, but this diverse diet makes it easy to find a
meal just about anywhere, even if it's poisonous to most animals. This roach has a bunch of
genes called Cytochrome P450s, which help it withstand
poisonous chemicals, like peppermint. These genes code for
detoxification enzymes, which keep the insect safe. On top of that, this roach has
a super-strong immune system that seeks out and kills
harmful microbes and fungi, making the most unsanitary environment look like a five-start hotel
to the American cockroach. Not gross enough yet? Well consider this. Cockroaches can live nearly
a week without their heads. Yeah, that's not a myth. They don't have a highly
pressurized network of blood vessels like humans,
so they don't bleed out. Instead, their necks actually
seal off the opening. They can't regenerate a whole head, but roaches to have an impressive set of regenerative superpowers. For up to the first two years of its life, the American roach goes through a series of regenerative molts as
it matures into an adult. During a single molt stage,
it can replace lost limbs. And over a series of molts,
it can regrow antennae and even its eyes. Roaches may be hard to kill, but there's an easy way to keep
them clear of your kitchen. Cleanliness. A roach just won't survive
in unsanitary conditions, it actually enjoys it. Its heightened senses mean it actually relishes rotting food. So, store food in airtight containers. Cover trash bins, and
keep your basement dry. It might also be smart to
plug holes in your walls, unused electrical outlets,
and especially drains, since get this, roaches can use your plumbing
to climb up from sewers into your bathroom sink. It might not eliminate the risk entirely, but it can't hurt, and it will certainly
make you feel better. However, we can't promise
it will keep them out of your nightmares. (dramatic music)

**Transcript**:
Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind, gazed in horror as he realized he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable. The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against 
invincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage 
for an epic series of adventures that would come to be known 
as the Labors of Hercules. The first labor was 
to slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies 
at a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive. The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow. Hercules tracked it for a year, finally trapping it in the northern land 
of Hyperborea. The animal turned out to be sacred 
to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Hercules swore to return it. When Eurystheus saw the hind, 
he demanded to keep it instead, but as soon as Hercules let go,
the animal ran to its mistress. Thus, Hercules completed his task 
without breaking his promise. The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar, which had ravaged many fields. Advised by the wise centaur Chiron, Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow. For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers. The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle had not been maintained in ages. Hercules promised to clean them in one day if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock. Augeas expected the hero to fail. Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches, rerouting two nearby rivers to flow 
through the stables until they were spotless. Next came three more beastly foes, each requiring 
a clever strategy to defeat. The carnivorous Stymphalian birds 
nested in an impenetrable swamp, but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air, at which point he shot them down. No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage, but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick. And the mad King Diomedes, who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests, got a taste of his own medicine when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables. The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths. But the ninth labor involved someone 
more dangerous than any beast, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Hercules was to retrieve the belt given
to her by her father Ares, the god of war. He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira
prepared for battle, but the queen was so impressed 
with the hero and his exploits that she gave the belt willingly. For his tenth labor, Hercules had to steal a herd 
of magical red cattle from Geryon, a giant with three heads and three bodies. On his way, Hercules was so annoyed 
by the Libyan desert heat that he shot an arrow at the Sun. The sun god Helios admired 
the hero’s strength and lent his chariot for the journey 
to the island of Erytheia. There, Hercules fought off 
Geryon’s herdsman and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself. That should have been the end. But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted: the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it, and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment. And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task, obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs. Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location. Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas
holding up the heavens. Hercules offered to take his place 
if Atlas would retrieve the apples. Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then
tricked him into trading places again, escaping with apples in hand. The twelfth and final task 
was to bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hound 
guarding the underworld. Helped by Hermes and Athena, 
Hercules descended and met Hades himself. The lord of the dead allowed Hercules 
to take the beast if he could do it without weapons, which he achieved by grabbing 
all three of its heads at once. When he presented the hound 
to a horrified Eurystheus, the king finally declared 
the hero’s service complete. After 12 years of toil, Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths 
of his family and earned a place in the divine pantheon. But his victory held 
an even deeper importance. In overcoming the chaotic 
and monstrous forces of the world, the hero swept away what remained 
of the Titans’ primordial order, reshaping it into one 
where humanity could thrive. Through his labors, Hercules tamed the world’s madness 
by atoning for his own.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 6: Analyze the character of King Eurystheus. What motivates him to assign the twelve labors to Hercules?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it involves understanding the relationship between Eurystheus and Hercules, as well as Eurystheus's motivations. Although the question is phrased differently, it requires the same understanding of the characters and their relationships.

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly asks about the relationship between Eurystheus and Hercules. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if we look at the options provided in Question 6, option B states that Eurystheus "hopes to humiliate Hercules and prove his own superiority." This is related to the fact that Eurystheus is Hercules' cousin, as mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, while not a perfect match, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 6**.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not directly ask about the relationship between Eurystheus and Hercules, so the match is not exact.

If I had to choose an index, I would say **6**.

the most unspeakable crime imaginable. The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against 
invincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage 
for an epic series of adventures that would come to be known 
as the Labors of Hercules. The first labor was 
to slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies 
at a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive. The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow. Hercules tracked it for a year, finally trapping it in the northern land 
of Hyperborea. The animal turned out to be sacred 
to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Hercules swore to return it. When Eurystheus saw the hind, 
he demanded to keep it instead, but as soon as Hercules let go,
the animal ran to its mistress. Thus, Hercules completed his task 
without breaking his promise. The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar, which had ravaged many fields. Advised by the wise centaur Chiron, Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow. For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers. The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle had not been maintained in ages. Hercules promised to clean them in one day if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock. Augeas expected the hero to fail. Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches, rerouting two nearby rivers to flow 
through the stables until they were spotless. Next came three more beastly foes, each requiring 
a clever strategy to defeat. The carnivorous Stymphalian birds 
nested in an impenetrable swamp, but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air, at which point he shot them down. No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage, but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick. And the mad King Diomedes, who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests, got a taste of his own medicine when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables. The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths. But the ninth labor involved someone 
more dangerous than any beast, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Hercules was to retrieve the belt given
to her by her father Ares, the god of war. He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira
prepared for battle, but the queen was so impressed 
with the hero and his exploits that she gave the belt willingly. For his tenth labor, Hercules had to steal a herd 
of magical red cattle from Geryon, a giant with three heads and three bodies. On his way, Hercules was so annoyed 
by the Libyan desert heat that he shot an arrow at the Sun. The sun god Helios admired 
the hero’s strength and lent his chariot for the journey 
to the island of Erytheia. There, Hercules fought off 
Geryon’s herdsman and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself. That should have been the end. But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted: the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it, and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment. And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task, obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs. Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location. Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas
holding up the heavens. Hercules offered to take his place 
if Atlas would retrieve the apples. Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then
tricked him into trading places again, escaping with apples in hand. The twelfth and final task 
was to bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hound 
guarding the underworld. Helped by Hermes and Athena, 
Hercules descended and met Hades himself. The lord of the dead allowed Hercules 
to take the beast if he could do it without weapons, which he achieved by grabbing 
all three of its heads at once. When he presented the hound 
to a horrified Eurystheus, the king finally declared 
the hero’s service complete. After 12 years of toil, Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths 
of his family and earned a place in the divine pantheon. But his victory held 
an even deeper importance. In overcoming the chaotic 
and monstrous forces of the world, the hero swept away what remained 
of the Titans’ primordial order, reshaping it into one 
where humanity could thrive. Through his labors, Hercules tamed the world’s madness 
by atoning for his own.

However, this question still does not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a question index, I would say that there is no matching question, but the closest one would be a non-existent question that is similar to Question 4, but with the Stymphalian birds instead of the Lernaean Hydra.

This question is similar in intent and content to the ground truth MCQ. However, since this question is not present in the provided generated MCQs, I cannot provide an index.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar, I would choose Question 1, but it is not a good match since it asks about Hercules' father, not the god who helped him reach Geryon's island.

Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

**Transcript**:
Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind, gazed in horror as he realized he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable. The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against 
invincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage 
for an epic series of adventures that would come to be known 
as the Labors of Hercules. The first labor was 
to slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies 
at a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive. The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow. Hercules tracked it for a year, finally trapping it in the northern land 
of Hyperborea. The animal turned out to be sacred 
to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Hercules swore to return it. When Eurystheus saw the hind, 
he demanded to keep it instead, but as soon as Hercules let go,
the animal ran to its mistress. Thus, Hercules completed his task 
without breaking his promise. The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar, which had ravaged many fields. Advised by the wise centaur Chiron, Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow. For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers. The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle had not been maintained in ages. Hercules promised to clean them in one day if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock. Augeas expected the hero to fail. Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches, rerouting two nearby rivers to flow 
through the stables until they were spotless. Next came three more beastly foes, each requiring 
a clever strategy to defeat. The carnivorous Stymphalian birds 
nested in an impenetrable swamp, but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air, at which point he shot them down. No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage, but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick. And the mad King Diomedes, who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests, got a taste of his own medicine when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables. The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths. But the ninth labor involved someone 
more dangerous than any beast, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Hercules was to retrieve the belt given
to her by her father Ares, the god of war. He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira
prepared for battle, but the queen was so impressed 
with the hero and his exploits that she gave the belt willingly. For his tenth labor, Hercules had to steal a herd 
of magical red cattle from Geryon, a giant with three heads and three bodies. On his way, Hercules was so annoyed 
by the Libyan desert heat that he shot an arrow at the Sun. The sun god Helios admired 
the hero’s strength and lent his chariot for the journey 
to the island of Erytheia. There, Hercules fought off 
Geryon’s herdsman and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself. That should have been the end. But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted: the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it, and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment. And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task, obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs. Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location. Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas
holding up the heavens. Hercules offered to take his place 
if Atlas would retrieve the apples. Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then
tricked him into trading places again, escaping with apples in hand. The twelfth and final task 
was to bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hound 
guarding the underworld. Helped by Hermes and Athena, 
Hercules descended and met Hades himself. The lord of the dead allowed Hercules 
to take the beast if he could do it without weapons, which he achieved by grabbing 
all three of its heads at once. When he presented the hound 
to a horrified Eurystheus, the king finally declared 
the hero’s service complete. After 12 years of toil, Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths 
of his family and earned a place in the divine pantheon. But his victory held 
an even deeper importance. In overcoming the chaotic 
and monstrous forces of the world, the hero swept away what remained 
of the Titans’ primordial order, reshaping it into one 
where humanity could thrive. Through his labors, Hercules tamed the world’s madness 
by atoning for his own.

**Transcript**:
The discovery of an alien monolith 
on planet RH-1729 has scientists across the world 
racing to unlock its mysteries. Your engineering team has developed 
an elegant probe to study it. The probe is a collection 
of 27 cube modules capable of running all the scientific 
tests necessary to analyze the monolith. The modules can self-assemble 
into a large 3x3x3 cube, with each individual module
placed anywhere in the cube, and at any orientation. It can also break itself apart 
and reassemble into any other orientation. Now comes your job. The probe will need a special 
protective coating for each of the extreme
environments it passes through. The red coating will seal it against 
the cold of deep space, the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729, and the green coating will shield it 
from the alien planet’s electric storms. You can apply the coatings to each of
the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules in any way you like, but each face can only 
take a single color coating. You need to figure out how you 
can apply the colors so the cubes can re-assemble themselves
to show only red, then purple, then green. How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes so the probe will be able 
to make the trip? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. You can start by painting the outside 
of the complete cube red, since you’ll need that regardless. Then you can break it into 27 pieces, 
and look at what you have. There are 8 corner cubes, 
which each have three red faces, 12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces, 6 face cubes, which have 1 red face, and a single center cube, 
which has no red faces. You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red 
at this point, so you’ll need the same number of faces 
for the green and purple cubes, too. When you’re done, 
you’ll have painted 54 faces red, 54 faces green, and 54 faces purple. That’s 162 faces, which is precisely 
how many the cubes have in total. So there’s no margin for waste. If there’s any way to do this,
it’ll probably be highly symmetrical. Maybe you can use that to help you. You look at the center cube. You’d better paint it half green 
and half purple, so you can use it as a corner 
for each of those cubes, and not waste a single face. There’ll need to be center cubes
with no green and no purple too. So you take 2 corner cubes 
from the red cube and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple, and the 3 blank faces of the other green. Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes 
that each have 1 face painted red. That leaves 5 empty faces on each. You can split them in half. In the first group, 
you paint 3 faces green and 2 faces purple; In the second group, 
paint 3 faces purple and 2 green. Counting on symmetry, you replicate these piles again
with the colors rearranged. That gives you 6 with 1 green face, 6 with 1 red face, and 6 with 1 purple face. Counting up 
what you’ve completely painted, you see 8 corner cubes in each color, 6 edge cubes in each color, 6 face cubes in each color, and 1 center cube. That means you just need 6 more edge cubes
in green and purple. And there are exactly 6 cubes left,
each with 4 empty faces. You paint 2 faces of each green 
and 2 faces of each purple. And now you have a cube that’s perfectly 
painted to make an incredible trip. It rearranges itself 
to be red in deep space, purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere, and green when it flies through 
the electric storms. As it reaches the monolith, you realize you’ve achieved 
something humans have dreamt of for eons: alien contact.

But among the given options, Question 5 is the closest match because it describes the different types of cubes and their counts, which can be used to infer the number of cubes with exactly 2 faces painted red (i.e., the edge cubes).

A more direct match would be a question that specifically asks about the number of cubes with exactly 2 faces painted red. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose Question 5 (Index 5), but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

However, after re-reading the text, I noticed that I missed the fact that the text does mention "12 edge cubes, which have two red faces" which is a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

With this new information, I can conclude that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not present among the options, but the closest match would be the information present in the text that describes the edge cubes.

If I had to choose an index based on the closest match, I would say that the closest match is the information in Question 5, but since it's not a direct match, I would say that there is no direct match among the generated MCQs.

But if I really had to choose an index, I would choose index 5, with the caveat that the question does not directly ask about the number of cubes with exactly 2 faces painted red, but the correct information is present in the text that describes the edge cubes.

However, I must note that a direct match would be a question like this: 
Question: How many of the 27 cubes have exactly 2 of their faces painted red?
Options: A. 1, B. 6, C. 8, D. 12 

And this question is not present among the generated MCQs.

In this case, I would say that the correct index is "Not present among the options".

But if I really had to choose, I would say index 5, with the caveats mentioned above.

The correct answer is index 5.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The discovery of an alien monolith 
on planet RH-1729 has scientists across the world 
racing to unlock its mysteries. Your engineering team has developed 
an elegant probe to study it. The probe is a collection 
of 27 cube modules capable of running all the scientific 
tests necessary to analyze the monolith. The modules can self-assemble 
into a large 3x3x3 cube, with each individual module
placed anywhere in the cube, and at any orientation. It can also break itself apart 
and reassemble into any other orientation. Now comes your job. The probe will need a special 
protective coating for each of the extreme
environments it passes through. The red coating will seal it against 
the cold of deep space, the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729, and the green coating will shield it 
from the alien planet’s electric storms. You can apply the coatings to each of
the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules in any way you like, but each face can only 
take a single color coating. You need to figure out how you 
can apply the colors so the cubes can re-assemble themselves
to show only red, then purple, then green. How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes so the probe will be able 
to make the trip? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. You can start by painting the outside 
of the complete cube red, since you’ll need that regardless. Then you can break it into 27 pieces, 
and look at what you have. There are 8 corner cubes, 
which each have three red faces, 12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces, 6 face cubes, which have 1 red face, and a single center cube, 
which has no red faces. You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red 
at this point, so you’ll need the same number of faces 
for the green and purple cubes, too. When you’re done, 
you’ll have painted 54 faces red, 54 faces green, and 54 faces purple. That’s 162 faces, which is precisely 
how many the cubes have in total. So there’s no margin for waste. If there’s any way to do this,
it’ll probably be highly symmetrical. Maybe you can use that to help you. You look at the center cube. You’d better paint it half green 
and half purple, so you can use it as a corner 
for each of those cubes, and not waste a single face. There’ll need to be center cubes
with no green and no purple too. So you take 2 corner cubes 
from the red cube and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple, and the 3 blank faces of the other green. Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes 
that each have 1 face painted red. That leaves 5 empty faces on each. You can split them in half. In the first group, 
you paint 3 faces green and 2 faces purple; In the second group, 
paint 3 faces purple and 2 green. Counting on symmetry, you replicate these piles again
with the colors rearranged. That gives you 6 with 1 green face, 6 with 1 red face, and 6 with 1 purple face. Counting up 
what you’ve completely painted, you see 8 corner cubes in each color, 6 edge cubes in each color, 6 face cubes in each color, and 1 center cube. That means you just need 6 more edge cubes
in green and purple. And there are exactly 6 cubes left,
each with 4 empty faces. You paint 2 faces of each green 
and 2 faces of each purple. And now you have a cube that’s perfectly 
painted to make an incredible trip. It rearranges itself 
to be red in deep space, purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere, and green when it flies through 
the electric storms. As it reaches the monolith, you realize you’ve achieved 
something humans have dreamt of for eons: alien contact.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: How many corner cubes, edge cubes, and face cubes are there in the 3x3x3 cube configuration?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the number of cubes with 0 faces painted red, it does provide information about the different types of cubes (corner, edge, and face cubes) and their quantities. The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ can be inferred from this information, as the center cube is the only cube with 0 faces painted red.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 5** is the most similar, as it provides relevant information about the cube configuration.

That being said, I must note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of how many cubes have exactly 0 faces painted red. If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would rephrase Question 5 to focus on the number of cubes with 0 red faces.

**Transcript**:
From asteroids capable 
of destroying entire species, to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae 
that could exterminate life on Earth, outer space has no shortage of forces
that could wreak havoc on our tiny planet. But there’s something in space that seems more terrifying 
than any of these – something that wipes out 
everything it comes near. Could the Earth 
be swallowed by a black hole? A black hole is an object so dense that space and time around it 
are inescapably modified, warped into an infinite sink. Nothing, not even light,
can move fast enough to escape a black hole’s 
gravitational pull once it passes a certain boundary, known as the event horizon. Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity, gobbling up everything in its path, 
and letting nothing out. To determine whether a black hole 
could swallow the Earth, we first have to figure out 
where they are. But since they don’t emit light, 
how’s that possible? Fortunately, we’re able to observe 
their effect on the space around them. When matter approaches a black hole, the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed. This emits an enormous amount of light. And for objects too far away 
to be sucked in, the massive gravitational force 
still affects their orbits. If we observe several stars orbiting
around an apparently empty point, a black hole could be leading the dance. Similarly, light that passes
close enough to an event horizon will be deflected in a phenomenon 
known as gravitational lensing. Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types. The smaller ones, 
called stellar mass black holes, have a mass up to 100 times larger 
than that of our sun. They’re formed when a massive star 
consumes all its nuclear fuel and its core collapses. We’ve observed several of these
objects as close as 3000 light-years away, and there could be up to 100 million 
small black holes just in the Milky Way galaxy. So should we be worried? Probably not. Despite their large mass, stellar black holes only have a radius 
of around 300 kilometers or less, making the chances 
of a direct hit with us miniscule. Although because 
their gravitational fields can affect a planet from a large distance, they could be dangerous 
even without a direct collision. If a typical stellar-mass black hole 
were to pass in the region of Neptune, the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified, with dire results. Still, the combination of how small 
they are and how vast the galaxy is means that stellar black holes
don’t give us much to worry about. But we still have to meet the second type: supermassive black holes. These have masses millions or billions
times greater than that of our sun and have event horizons that
could span billions of kilometers. These giants have grown 
to immense proportions by swallowing matter 
and merging with other black holes. Unlike their stellar cousins, supermassive black holes aren’t
wandering through space. Instead, they lie at the center 
of galaxies, including our own. Our solar system is in a stable orbit 
around a supermassive black hole that resides 
at the center of the Milky Way, at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years. But that could change. If our galaxy collides with another, the Earth could be thrown towards 
the galactic center, close enough 
to the supermassive black hole to be eventually swallowed up. In fact, a collision 
with the Andromeda Galaxy is predicted to happen 
4 billion years from now, which may not be great news
for our home planet. But before we judge them too harshly, black holes aren’t simply agents 
of destruction. They played a crucial role 
in the formation of galaxies, the building blocks of our universe. Far from being shadowy characters 
in the cosmic play, black holes have fundamentally contributed in making the universe 
a bright and astonishing place.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly addresses how astronomers can observe black holes.

A more suitable match can be found in Question 2, which explains why black holes are difficult to detect directly, and the correct option states that they don't emit light. This is related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks how astronomers can observe black holes. 

However, an even more suitable match can be constructed by combining the content of Question 2 and Question 3. Question 3 states that the immense gravitational field of a black hole causes a significant increase in the speed of nearby stars, which is an indirect method of observing black holes.

Given the available options, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, but with the understanding that a more suitable match would be a question that directly addresses the observation of black holes through their gravitational effects.

**Transcript**:
From asteroids capable 
of destroying entire species, to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae 
that could exterminate life on Earth, outer space has no shortage of forces
that could wreak havoc on our tiny planet. But there’s something in space that seems more terrifying 
than any of these – something that wipes out 
everything it comes near. Could the Earth 
be swallowed by a black hole? A black hole is an object so dense that space and time around it 
are inescapably modified, warped into an infinite sink. Nothing, not even light,
can move fast enough to escape a black hole’s 
gravitational pull once it passes a certain boundary, known as the event horizon. Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity, gobbling up everything in its path, 
and letting nothing out. To determine whether a black hole 
could swallow the Earth, we first have to figure out 
where they are. But since they don’t emit light, 
how’s that possible? Fortunately, we’re able to observe 
their effect on the space around them. When matter approaches a black hole, the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed. This emits an enormous amount of light. And for objects too far away 
to be sucked in, the massive gravitational force 
still affects their orbits. If we observe several stars orbiting
around an apparently empty point, a black hole could be leading the dance. Similarly, light that passes
close enough to an event horizon will be deflected in a phenomenon 
known as gravitational lensing. Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types. The smaller ones, 
called stellar mass black holes, have a mass up to 100 times larger 
than that of our sun. They’re formed when a massive star 
consumes all its nuclear fuel and its core collapses. We’ve observed several of these
objects as close as 3000 light-years away, and there could be up to 100 million 
small black holes just in the Milky Way galaxy. So should we be worried? Probably not. Despite their large mass, stellar black holes only have a radius 
of around 300 kilometers or less, making the chances 
of a direct hit with us miniscule. Although because 
their gravitational fields can affect a planet from a large distance, they could be dangerous 
even without a direct collision. If a typical stellar-mass black hole 
were to pass in the region of Neptune, the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified, with dire results. Still, the combination of how small 
they are and how vast the galaxy is means that stellar black holes
don’t give us much to worry about. But we still have to meet the second type: supermassive black holes. These have masses millions or billions
times greater than that of our sun and have event horizons that
could span billions of kilometers. These giants have grown 
to immense proportions by swallowing matter 
and merging with other black holes. Unlike their stellar cousins, supermassive black holes aren’t
wandering through space. Instead, they lie at the center 
of galaxies, including our own. Our solar system is in a stable orbit 
around a supermassive black hole that resides 
at the center of the Milky Way, at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years. But that could change. If our galaxy collides with another, the Earth could be thrown towards 
the galactic center, close enough 
to the supermassive black hole to be eventually swallowed up. In fact, a collision 
with the Andromeda Galaxy is predicted to happen 
4 billion years from now, which may not be great news
for our home planet. But before we judge them too harshly, black holes aren’t simply agents 
of destruction. They played a crucial role 
in the formation of galaxies, the building blocks of our universe. Far from being shadowy characters 
in the cosmic play, black holes have fundamentally contributed in making the universe 
a bright and astonishing place.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although the wording of Question 6 is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. Both questions assess the likelihood of Earth being destroyed or affected by a black hole. The correct options in both questions convey that the threat posed by black holes (specifically stellar mass black holes in Question 6) is low.

However, it's worth noting that the scope of Question 6 is narrower than the ground truth MCQ, as it only considers stellar mass black holes, whereas the ground truth MCQ does not specify a type of black hole.

A more comprehensive match would be beneficial, but given the available options, Question 6 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. I am a descendent of giants. With a grandfather, dad, two uncles, and an
aunt all towering over 6 feet tall. We are the people you don’t want to stand
behind at a Bon Jovi concert, but we’re also the people who can get that thing off
the top shelf for you. At 6’3”, I turned out to be the short
one in the family. Now that I have a son myself, I’m wondering
if he’s going to be tall too. Is height only written in our genes or is
there something else that determines how tall These days, the average American woman is
about five foot four, while the average Joe American male is about five foot nine. But… human height has had its ups and downs
over the centuries. Three million years ago, our ancestor Australopithecus
only stood about four feet tall. One-and-a-half million years later , Homo
erectus, the first early human to use complex tools, reached up to five foot seven. And by the Stone Age, men of the Gravettian
hunter-gatherer culture in Europe stood at an average of 6 feet. Most of the historical data we have is for
male height, because… reasons. Then agriculture happened. When Europeans switched to a lower-protein,
higher-grain diet, men gradually lost 8 inches in height, on average. And they stayed that way for thousands of
years. By the time the 18th century rolled around,
the average European man was only five foot five inches tall. But when those Europeans emigrated to America,
their kids grew up to be five foot eight inches tall on average. A huge jump in just a generation. During the Industrial Revolution heights took
a dip due to urban crowding and disease, but soon after, the human height boom continued
and continues today. Every decade for the past couple centuries
Europeans have grown an average of about half an inch. Today, Dutch men are the tallest people in
the world, with an average height of just over 6 feet - back to where those Gravettians
started 8 millennia ago. These fluctuations of height, sometimes within
a single generation, show that our environment determines a big part of how tall we are. But people in different regions, and different
families, show us that height has genetic causes too. So which has a bigger role, nature? Or nurture? In the early 19th century, scientists first
noticed a correlation between people’s heights and their wealth – people from poor backgrounds
tended to be shorter than people who were more well-off. Instead of asking whether someone’s upbringing
might influence their height, many scholars at the time decided tallness was a physical
mark of “superior” humans. Francis Galton - who would later become infamous
for popularizing eugenics - was the first scientist to conduct a large-scale, systematic
study of height. He precisely measured the height of thousands
of people as part of a sort of scientific side show. But Galton’s results were confusing. Parents’ heights often didn’t predict
the heights of their kids. The heights of siblings on the other hand,
were much closer. This inspired scientists to look at height
in twins. Studying twins can teach us a ton about how
genes and environments influence human attributes. Fraternal twins can be as different genetically
as any other pair of siblings, with the added advantage of being exactly the same age. Identical twins are genetically, well, identical. So we can see how much genetic carbon copies
end up differing. And twins separated at birth offer a window
into what happens when genetically identical individuals grow up in very different environments. Turns out that twins, especially identical
twins, tend to be close in height - but not exactly the same. Twin studies, like history, show us genes
can only be part of the story when it comes to height. So how big a part? In 2007, scientists compared height and DNA
between more than 11,000 pairs of siblings and found that, across humans, 86% of height’s
variation can be explained by genetics. As traits go, this is very high; for comparison,
genetics only explains about 26% of left-handedness. So we should be able to predict a person’s
height from his or her DNA right? Not so fast. We know genes make a huge difference, just
not which genes. So far, scientists have identified about 800
genes that influence height, but many of them only make a tiny contribution. Take HGMA2, one of the first genes linked
to height. Having one copy of the “tall” version
only “lifts” a person about an eighth of an inch, so even if you inherit a copy
from both of your parents, that still only gains you a quarter of an inch at most. Altogether, the 800 height genes we know of
can only explain 27% of how height varies between people. There’s clearly lots of genetic influence
we don’t understand. Maybe the effects of some genes add up in
unexpected ways - genes may interact in combinations, where four and four makes sixteen, not eight. If we could just study the DNA of all the
7 billion people on Earth, maybe we would find all the genes that affect height. Or maybe we’d find that scientists have
overestimated the contribution of genetics? Because our environment, defined by health
and diet, certainly has a hand in shaping our height. South Koreans today are more than an inch
taller than North Koreans, despite minimal genetic differences. Clearly, one’s diet during childhood, is
a crucial in determining adult height. That’s why humans shrank with the switch
to agriculture and again during the Industrial Revolution. Today, most scientists agree that nature and
nurture combine to shape our height. Some even propose calling height an “omnigenic”
trait - one that nearly all our genes influence in some way. For now, the only surefire way to know how
tall you’ll end up… is just to wait and see. Stay curious!

their kids grew up to be five foot eight inches tall on average. A huge jump in just a generation. During the Industrial Revolution heights took
a dip due to urban crowding and disease, but soon after, the human height boom continued
and continues today. Every decade for the past couple centuries
Europeans have grown an average of about half an inch. Today, Dutch men are the tallest people in
the world, with an average height of just over 6 feet - back to where those Gravettians
started 8 millennia ago. These fluctuations of height, sometimes within
a single generation, show that our environment determines a big part of how tall we are. But people in different regions, and different
families, show us that height has genetic causes too. So which has a bigger role, nature? Or nurture? In the early 19th century, scientists first
noticed a correlation between people’s heights and their wealth – people from poor backgrounds
tended to be shorter than people who were more well-off. Instead of asking whether someone’s upbringing
might influence their height, many scholars at the time decided tallness was a physical
mark of “superior” humans. Francis Galton - who would later become infamous
for popularizing eugenics - was the first scientist to conduct a large-scale, systematic
study of height. He precisely measured the height of thousands
of people as part of a sort of scientific side show. But Galton’s results were confusing. Parents’ heights often didn’t predict
the heights of their kids. The heights of siblings on the other hand,
were much closer. This inspired scientists to look at height
in twins. Studying twins can teach us a ton about how
genes and environments influence human attributes. Fraternal twins can be as different genetically
as any other pair of siblings, with the added advantage of being exactly the same age. Identical twins are genetically, well, identical. So we can see how much genetic carbon copies
end up differing. And twins separated at birth offer a window
into what happens when genetically identical individuals grow up in very different environments. Turns out that twins, especially identical
twins, tend to be close in height - but not exactly the same. Twin studies, like history, show us genes
can only be part of the story when it comes to height. So how big a part? In 2007, scientists compared height and DNA
between more than 11,000 pairs of siblings and found that, across humans, 86% of height’s
variation can be explained by genetics. As traits go, this is very high; for comparison,
genetics only explains about 26% of left-handedness. So we should be able to predict a person’s
height from his or her DNA right? Not so fast. We know genes make a huge difference, just
not which genes. So far, scientists have identified about 800
genes that influence height, but many of them only make a tiny contribution. Take HGMA2, one of the first genes linked
to height. Having one copy of the “tall” version
only “lifts” a person about an eighth of an inch, so even if you inherit a copy
from both of your parents, that still only gains you a quarter of an inch at most. Altogether, the 800 height genes we know of
can only explain 27% of how height varies between people. There’s clearly lots of genetic influence
we don’t understand. Maybe the effects of some genes add up in
unexpected ways - genes may interact in combinations, where four and four makes sixteen, not eight. If we could just study the DNA of all the
7 billion people on Earth, maybe we would find all the genes that affect height. Or maybe we’d find that scientists have
overestimated the contribution of genetics? Because our environment, defined by health
and diet, certainly has a hand in shaping our height. South Koreans today are more than an inch
taller than North Koreans, despite minimal genetic differences. Clearly, one’s diet during childhood, is
a crucial in determining adult height. That’s why humans shrank with the switch
to agriculture and again during the Industrial Revolution. Today, most scientists agree that nature and
nurture combine to shape our height. Some even propose calling height an “omnigenic”
trait - one that nearly all our genes influence in some way. For now, the only surefire way to know how
tall you’ll end up… is just to wait and see. Stay curious!

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. I am a descendent of giants. With a grandfather, dad, two uncles, and an
aunt all towering over 6 feet tall. We are the people you don’t want to stand
behind at a Bon Jovi concert, but we’re also the people who can get that thing off
the top shelf for you. At 6’3”, I turned out to be the short
one in the family. Now that I have a son myself, I’m wondering
if he’s going to be tall too. Is height only written in our genes or is
there something else that determines how tall These days, the average American woman is
about five foot four, while the average Joe American male is about five foot nine. But… human height has had its ups and downs
over the centuries. Three million years ago, our ancestor Australopithecus
only stood about four feet tall. One-and-a-half million years later , Homo
erectus, the first early human to use complex tools, reached up to five foot seven. And by the Stone Age, men of the Gravettian
hunter-gatherer culture in Europe stood at an average of 6 feet. Most of the historical data we have is for
male height, because… reasons. Then agriculture happened. When Europeans switched to a lower-protein,
higher-grain diet, men gradually lost 8 inches in height, on average. And they stayed that way for thousands of
years. By the time the 18th century rolled around,
the average European man was only five foot five inches tall. But when those Europeans emigrated to America,
their kids grew up to be five foot eight inches tall on average. A huge jump in just a generation. During the Industrial Revolution heights took

**Transcript**:
- [Narrator] If you doubled in size, your weight would be eight times greater. That's the trouble with growing tall. Gravity's pull is keeping us all down, but there are a few earthly giants that have fought gravity and won. (gentle instrumental music) The key to growing tall is
how you use your energy. That's why the tallest trees
outrank any animal on Earth, because trees spend all
their energy on one thing; growing taller than
their fellow neighbors. And there are two trees
that are the best growers of them all: giant redwoods
and mountain ashes. Redwoods are renowned as the
tallest lifeforms on Earth, but some experts think that
mountain ashes could grow even taller if humans would
stop cutting them down. In fact, the tallest mountain ash was just one meter shorter than
the tallest redwood. Unlike plants, animals spend
energy on all sorts of tasks, like eating, walking, and staying warm, so they can't grow as tall. But it doesn't mean they're small, either. If you measured this African elephant from shoulder to ground, it would actually be
taller than a giraffe, but thanks to their long, strong necks, giraffes are the tallest animals alive. And if we look at animals
throughout Earth's history, dinosaurs eclipsed them all. These towering sauropods were
the biggest of the bunch. In fact, the top ten lists of tallest animals in history? All dinosaurs. But what if we looked at
the longest lifeforms, too? If you balance the longest
saltwater crocodile on its nose, it would tie the giraffe. And if we ignore legs it gets even better. Tip-to-tail, the green
anaconda nearly doubles the height of the tallest giraffe. But these land-dwellers have
nothing on animals of the deep. Supported by water, sea life
can practically ignore gravity, which means they can grow much larger. Take the blue whale, for example. It's the most massive animal of all time. For example, the entire cast of Broadway's The Lion King can fit on its tongue. But it should be careful
not to get tangled up in the tentacles of a
lion's mane jellyfish, which makes the giant squid
look small by comparison. Now, the biggest fish
alive is the whale shark, and if we look into the
past things get even bigger. So where do humans fit into all this? Somewhere near the top, actually. Humans are bigger than
87.6% of mammals on Earth and the average Dutchman
is the tallest of them all. So there's no reason to
ever feel small again, especially if you're from the Netherlands. (gentle instrumental music) Fun fact, the longest
life-form of all time isn't a plant or animal at all. It's a honey fungus and
the biggest one goes on for 3.8 kilometers underneath
a forest in Oregon.

**Transcript**:
“Here lies Arthur, 
king who was, and king who will be.” So reads the inscription 
on King Arthur’s gravestone in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. Writing in the 15th century, Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic
this inscription would turn out to be. King Arthur has risen again 
and again in our collective imagination, along with his retinue of knights, Guinevere, the Round Table, Camelot, and of course, Excalibur. But where do these stories come from,
and is there any truth to them? King Arthur as we know him 
is a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots 
in Celtic poetry from an earlier time: the Saxon invasions of Britain. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from 
what’s now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the vulnerability 
of the abandoned territory. The inhabitants of Britain fought 
fiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil. There are hardly any written records 
from this time, so it’s difficult to reconstruct 
an accurate history. However, surviving poetry from the era
gives us some clues. One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur, though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it. It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur, was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur. That’s not much to go on, but whoever this Arthur was, he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors. Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear. Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later. In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
was a lowly cleric with grand ambitions. Using Celtic and Latin sources, he spent years creating 
a lengthy chronicle titled, "The History 
of the Kings of Britain." The centerpiece 
of this tome was King Arthur. History is a generous term 
for Geoffrey’s account. Writing six hundred years after 
the Saxon invasions, he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records. A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places. But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery. Geoffrey blended them all: A magical sword called Caledfwlch and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material, so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus, the Latin translation of Caledfwlch. Geoffrey even added a wise
counselor named Merlin, based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, 
to Arthur’s story. If Arthur did live, he would likely 
have been a military leader, but a castle-bound king better fit
Geoffrey’s regal history. Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention 
he’d hoped for, and was soon translated from Latin
into French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE. Wace added another centerpiece of
Arthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword, castle, and wizard: the Round Table. He wrote that Arthur 
had the table constructed so that all guests in his court 
would be equally placed, and none could boast that he had 
the highest position at the table. After reading Wace’s translation, 
another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, wrote a series of romances 
that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur. In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem, his story has transformed over 
and over to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences. And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today. Whether or not the man ever lived, loved, reigned, or adventured, it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.

in with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur. In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem, his story has transformed over 
and over to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences. And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today. Whether or not the man ever lived, loved, reigned, or adventured, it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.

**Transcript**:
“Here lies Arthur, 
king who was, and king who will be.” So reads the inscription 
on King Arthur’s gravestone in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. Writing in the 15th century, Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic
this inscription would turn out to be. King Arthur has risen again 
and again in our collective imagination, along with his retinue of knights, Guinevere, the Round Table, Camelot, and of course, Excalibur. But where do these stories come from,
and is there any truth to them? King Arthur as we know him 
is a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots 
in Celtic poetry from an earlier time: the Saxon invasions of Britain. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from 
what’s now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the vulnerability 
of the abandoned territory. The inhabitants of Britain fought 
fiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil. There are hardly any written records 
from this time, so it’s difficult to reconstruct 
an accurate history. However, surviving poetry from the era
gives us some clues. One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur, though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it. It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur, was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur. That’s not much to go on, but whoever this Arthur was, he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors. Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear. Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later. In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
was a lowly cleric with grand ambitions. Using Celtic and Latin sources, he spent years creating 
a lengthy chronicle titled, "The History 
of the Kings of Britain." The centerpiece 
of this tome was King Arthur. History is a generous term 
for Geoffrey’s account. Writing six hundred years after 
the Saxon invasions, he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records. A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places. But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery. Geoffrey blended them all: A magical sword called Caledfwlch and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material, so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus, the Latin translation of Caledfwlch. Geoffrey even added a wise
counselor named Merlin, based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, 
to Arthur’s story. If Arthur did live, he would likely 
have been a military leader, but a castle-bound king better fit
Geoffrey’s regal history. Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention 
he’d hoped for, and was soon translated from Latin
into French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE. Wace added another centerpiece of
Arthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword, castle, and wizard: the Round Table. He wrote that Arthur 
had the table constructed so that all guests in his court 
would be equally placed, and none could boast that he had 
the highest position at the table. After reading Wace’s translation, 
another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, wrote a series of romances 
that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions focus on the importance of Chrétien de Troyes in the development of the Arthurian legends. The correct option in Question 9 (C. Chrétien de Troyes) is similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (C. He introduced courtly love and individual knightly quests into the legends), as both highlight Chrétien de Troyes' contributions to the Arthurian legends. 

Although the wording of the two questions is not identical, the overall intent and content are similar, making Question 9 the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You probably know how this symbol is supposed
to make you feel. And this one. This one too, even if you’re not sure exactly
what it means. But what about this? This symbol — The Jolly Roger — was once
one of the most feared symbols in the world. It represented death, pirates, and poison. But today, it’s associated more with treasure, blockbuster
movies, or Halloween than actual danger. We are surrounded by icons that warn us: what
to stay away from, what not to do, what to be afraid of. But how do you design a symbol in a way that
will last across generations and languages? It turns out that is an incredibly hard thing
to do. Back in the early 20th century, there was
an urgent need for a new kind of warning symbol. At the time, there was no universal standard
for communicating the presence of dangerous biological materials. Laboratories at the US Army used an inverted
blue triangle. Those at the Navy used a pink rectangle. The Universal Postal Convention used a white
staff-and-snake on a violet background. There was no consistency in the visual language
used to communicate risk. That was dangerous, and could lead to accidental
infections. So in 1966, a group of engineers and designers
at Dow Chemical set out to create the best possible icon for biohazardous materials. They laid out six design criteria. First, it needed to be visually striking,
so that it would draw immediate attention. That ruled out simple shapes like those from
the Navy and Army. It also had to be unique and unambiguous,
in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes. That ruled out the snake-and-staff, which
has multiple versions and has a pretty vague meaning as a general symbol for medicine. On top of that, it had to be quickly recognizable
and easily recalled. Had to be easy to stencil. And rotationally symmetrical, in order to
appear identical from all angles. And lastly, it had to be acceptable to groups
of all backgrounds. So the Dow Chemical team designed an experiment. Charles Baldwin, an environmental health engineer
behind the experiment, said that the team “wanted something that was memorable but
meaningless … so we could educate people as to what it means." They showed a set of 24 symbols to 300 people
from 25 American cities. There were 6 newly-designed biohazard markers,
and 18 common symbols — things like Mr. Peanut, the Texaco star, the Shell Oil symbol,
the Red Cross, and a swastika. Participants were asked to guess the meaning
of each one, which was used to assign each one a “meaningfulness score.” A week later, the same participants were shown
those original 24 symbols, plus 36 more. They were asked to identify which symbols
they remembered seeing in the previous round of the study. Among the six competing biohazard designs,
this one stood out. It scored the highest in memorability, but
the lowest in meaningfulness. So it was unforgettable, but also a totally
blank slate for designers who wanted to give it meaning. And with that, it became a national standard. It’s easy to overlook how much visual communication
work these symbols are doing. They’re simple — you only need a straightedge
and a compass to recreate them. And unlike most other hazard symbols, they
don’t reference an existing physical object or idea. But they’ve remained iconic for decades,
helping people recognize serious dangers that may remain a threat for thousands of years
to come. And that raises the question: could the meaning
of those symbols stand the test of time? Few people have pondered that question quite
like Gregory Benford. He’s a physicist and science fiction author. In the 1990s, he was invited to work on the
Waste Isolation Pilot Project, or WIPP. The WIPP is a massive storage site for radioactive
waste in the southeastern plains of New Mexico, organized by the US Department of Energy. Benford was brought in to help calculate the
probability that someone or something would intrude on the site for as long as it remains
dangerous — approximately the next 10,000 years. “Well, name anything that has persisted
for 10,000 years. Any institution. There isn't any. The record is probably something like the
Catholic Church or the core of the Jewish religion, which tells us something about what
really lasts.” The meaning of a symbol can change over time. Like the Jolly Roger, which wouldn't work
for the radioactive threat at the WIPP. "If you're approaching the WIPP facility and
you see a skull and crossbones you might think, ‘Hey this is where the pirates buried their
treasure.’” So how do you indicate a long lasting danger
across any language? Since the 1970s, engineers, anthropologists,
physicists, and behavioral scientists have proposed different solutions to that problem. One strategy was to add context to the symbol. By illustrating cause and effect in a three-part
cartoon like this, designers could communicate the idea even if the symbol lost its meaning. But this kind of visual communication still
made a lot of assumptions about the user: that they would read left to right, that they
would understand causality between frames — and, of course, that the drawing itself
would last millennia of wear and tear. So other designers started to focus on creating
a warning without inscribed communication, by altering the shape of the location itself. And that yielded designs like this. Spike fields, forbidding blocks, giant pyramids:
these designs capitalized on natural instincts of fear and discomfort to keep people away. But even then, they weren’t foolproof. Designers couldn’t be sure whether they
would be perceived as terrifying or fascinating. “Conflict between these two urges: you want
people to notice it but you don't want people to go there. Those are always going to fight each other.” So without symbols, without basic illustrations,
or physical structures, how can you effectively communicate a warning? That’s where the more philosophical design
solutions come in. In 1984, the German Journal of Semiotics published
a series of solutions from various scholars. Linguist Thomas Sebeok proposed creating an
atomic priesthood, where an exclusive political group would use its own rituals and myths
to preserve information about the radioactive areas. And philosophers François Bastide and Paolo
Fabbri proposed to genetically engineer bioluminescent cats that would glow in the presence of radioactivity. By creating songs and traditions about the
danger of glowing cats, the warning could last as long as the oldest relics of civilization
we have: culture. There’s no definitive solution for warning
people far into the future. But designing clear, inclusive symbols will
continue to be a fundamental part of how we keep people safe. We will change, and so will the ways we communicate
visually. Our warning symbols will have to change along
with us.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 1: What was the primary goal of the Dow Chemical team in designing a new symbol for biohazardous materials in 1966?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

A closer match is:

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what was the problem with the symbols used by the US Army, Navy, and Universal Postal Convention to communicate the presence of dangerous biological materials?**

However, this question still does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

The closest match is actually:

**None of the above questions match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, Question 5: According to Gregory Benford, what is the challenge in designing a warning symbol that will last for 10,000 years?** has a similar theme of designing a symbol, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the design criteria, I would choose:

**Question 3: What was the result of the experiment conducted by the Dow Chemical team to test the effectiveness of their new symbol?** is not a match, but Question 5 is not a match either.

However, I noticed that Question 8 has an option that is related to the design criteria.

**Question 8: According to the transcript, what is one of the challenges in designing a warning symbol that will be effective across cultures and languages?**

This question has an option C that says "Creating a symbol that will not be misinterpreted", which is related to the design criteria of being "Unique & unambiguous".

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:

**Question 8** is the closest match, but it's still not a direct match.

So, my final answer is:

**8**

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: What was the result of the experiment conducted by the Dow Chemical team to test the effectiveness of their new symbol?** is not the most similar, but **Question 8: According to the transcript, what is one of the challenges in designing a warning symbol that will be effective across cultures and languages?** has some similarities.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is actually **Question 5: According to Gregory Benford, what is the challenge in designing a warning symbol that will last for 10,000 years? Options: A. Creating a symbol that is visually striking, B. Creating a symbol that is easy to understand, C. Creating a symbol that will not change in meaning over time, D. Creating a symbol that will be remembered for 10,000 years Correct Option: C**

But this isn't an exact match either.

Upon closer inspection, I realize that I made a mistake. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the uniqueness of the biohazard symbol. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask this question directly.

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

**Question 2: According to the transcript, what was the problem with the symbols used by the US Army, Navy, and Universal Postal Convention to communicate the presence of dangerous biological materials?** is not a match.

But **Question 1: What was the primary goal of the Dow Chemical team in designing a new symbol for biohazardous materials in 1966?** has an option that mentions "unique and unambiguous".

I'd say the closest match is actually **Question 3**, but only because one of the options (B) mentions that "The symbol scored high in memorability and low in meaningfulness", which is somewhat related to the fact that the biohazard symbol is unique.

However, I must admit that I made a mistake, and I should have said that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose one of the generated MCQs, I would say that **Question 8** is the closest match, but only because it mentions the challenge of designing a warning symbol that will be effective across cultures and languages.

So, my final answer is: **8** (although I'm not very confident in this answer).

**Transcript**:
You’re overseeing the delivery 
of crucial supplies to a rebel base deep in the heart of enemy territory. To get past Imperial customs, all
packages must follow a strict protocol: if a box is marked with 
an even number on the bottom, it must be sealed with a red top. The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport when you receive an urgent message. One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one. All the boxes are still 
on the conveyor belt. Two are facing down: 
one marked with a four, and one with a seven. The other two are facing up: one with a black top, another with a red one. You know that any violation 
of the protocol will get the entire shipment confiscated
and put your allies in grave danger. But any boxes you pull off for inspection
won’t make it onto this delivery run, depriving the rebels 
of critically needed supplies. The transport leaves in a few moments,
with or without its cargo. Which box or boxes should you 
grab off the conveyor belt? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes to see what’s on the other side of each. But in fact, only two of them matter. Let’s look at the protocol again. All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top. It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes, so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven. What about the box with a red top? Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even? As it turns out, we don’t. The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number, then it should have a red top. It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops, or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number. The requirement 
only goes in one direction. So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid. We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid, to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box. If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone. That error is so common,
we even have a name for it: affirming the consequent, or the fallacy of the converse. This fallacy wrongly assumes that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result, it must also be sufficient for it. For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition for being a habitable planet. But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability. If that still seems hard 
to wrap your head around, let’s look at 
a slightly different problem. Imagine the boxes contain groceries. You see one marked for shipment 
to a steakhouse and one to a vegetarian restaurant. Then you see two more boxes 
turned upside down: one labeled as containing meat, and another as containing onions. Which ones do you need to check? Well, it’s easy – make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant, and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat. The onions can go to either place, and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product. Why does this scenario seem easier? Formally, it’s the same problem – two possible conditions
for the top of the box, and two for the bottom. But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs, and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables, they’re not the only ones who do so. In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary, and when they’re abstracted that way, the logical connections 
become harder to see. In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through to enable the resistance 
to fight another day. And you did it by thinking 
outside the box – both sides of it.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

This is because both the ground truth MCQ and Question 1 ask about the Imperial customs protocol, specifically what the protocol requires for boxes to be sealed. The correct options in both questions (B in the ground truth MCQ and C in Question 1) state that even-numbered boxes must have a red top. The other options in both questions are incorrect and provide alternative, but incorrect, protocols.

**Transcript**:
You’re overseeing the delivery 
of crucial supplies to a rebel base deep in the heart of enemy territory. To get past Imperial customs, all
packages must follow a strict protocol: if a box is marked with 
an even number on the bottom, it must be sealed with a red top. The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport when you receive an urgent message. One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one. All the boxes are still 
on the conveyor belt. Two are facing down: 
one marked with a four, and one with a seven. The other two are facing up: one with a black top, another with a red one. You know that any violation 
of the protocol will get the entire shipment confiscated
and put your allies in grave danger. But any boxes you pull off for inspection
won’t make it onto this delivery run, depriving the rebels 
of critically needed supplies. The transport leaves in a few moments,
with or without its cargo. Which box or boxes should you 
grab off the conveyor belt? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes to see what’s on the other side of each. But in fact, only two of them matter. Let’s look at the protocol again. All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top. It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes, so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven. What about the box with a red top? Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even? As it turns out, we don’t. The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number, then it should have a red top. It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops, or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number. The requirement 
only goes in one direction. So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid. We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid, to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box. If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone. That error is so common,
we even have a name for it: affirming the consequent, or the fallacy of the converse. This fallacy wrongly assumes that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result, it must also be sufficient for it. For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition for being a habitable planet. But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability. If that still seems hard 
to wrap your head around, let’s look at 
a slightly different problem. Imagine the boxes contain groceries. You see one marked for shipment 
to a steakhouse and one to a vegetarian restaurant. Then you see two more boxes 
turned upside down: one labeled as containing meat, and another as containing onions. Which ones do you need to check? Well, it’s easy – make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant, and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat. The onions can go to either place, and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product. Why does this scenario seem easier? Formally, it’s the same problem – two possible conditions
for the top of the box, and two for the bottom. But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs, and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables, they’re not the only ones who do so. In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary, and when they’re abstracted that way, the logical connections 
become harder to see. In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through to enable the resistance 
to fight another day. And you did it by thinking 
outside the box – both sides of it.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of even-numbered boxes, while the generated MCQs focus on different aspects of the problem. However, Question 9: "How many boxes need to be inspected to ensure that the protocol is followed?" is related to the idea of identifying specific boxes, although it doesn't directly ask about even-numbered boxes.

Considering the available options, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the question is phrased differently, the content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks why you shouldn't inspect all the boxes, and the correct answer is that any boxes you inspect won't make it into the shipment. Question 8 asks about the consequence of violating the protocol, which is related to the reason why you shouldn't inspect all the boxes. However, a more similar question is not present in the generated MCQs.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the consequence of inspecting a box, rather than violating the protocol. However, among the given options, Question 8 is the closest match.

However, another possible match could be Question 9 which mentions "How many boxes need to be inspected to ensure that the protocol is followed?" and one of the possible answers could lead to the fact that inspecting all the boxes (option D) is not the correct choice and the reason for that could be related to the ground truth MCQ, but it is not explicitly mentioned.

But if we were to choose the best possible match it would be Question 8.

**Transcript**:
The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang nearly fourteen billion
years ago, and has been expanding 
ever since. But what is it expanding into? That's a complicated question. Here's why: Einstein's equations of
general relativity describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected fabric for the universe. This means that what we know of
as space and time exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it. Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out into more space. But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into, what does expanding 
even mean? In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations gave us a definitive answer. His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies recede, or move away,
from the Earth. Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes. How can we interpret this? Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven. The batter rises by the same
amount in between each and every raisin. If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies, and batter as the space
between them, we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other, and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger distance than the nearby ones in the same amount of time. Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion. It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding 
unto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang. The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe, as a sparse gas --but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be? The inflationary model 
describes a brief era of incredibly rapid expansion that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe, to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies. If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation. We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality, save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state. In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes. Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them —would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics. Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse, in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible for us to encounter a neighbor universe. The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces may unify into one super-force. Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification, in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons. In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe. Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description, and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes. Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane, floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace. Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace, and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity. Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse, but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other. An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background —a soup of radiation throughout our universe, 
that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era. So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo. Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description, or be replaced by something else. As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models. While these models are inspired and 
guided by many scientific experiments, there are very few objective experiments 
to directly test them, yet. Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along, scientists will likely be left to argue about 
the elegance of their competing models… and continue to dream about what, 
if anything, lies beyond our universe.

This question is related to Hubble's observations, but it does not directly address the implication of these observations for the universe.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is most closely related to the topic.

However, I noticed that the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ "B. The universe is expanding unto itself." is mentioned in the transcript after discussing Hubble's observations and the analogy of the raisin bread. 

With this in mind, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the implication of Hubble's observations for the universe could be the most similar match.

If I had to choose one of the existing generated MCQs, I would choose **Question 3** as the most similar match, but keep in mind that it's not a direct match.

galaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding 
unto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang. The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe, as a sparse gas --but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be? The inflationary model 
describes a brief era of incredibly rapid expansion that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe, to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies. If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation. We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality, save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state. In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes. Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them —would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics. Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse, in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible for us to encounter a neighbor universe. The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces may unify into one super-force. Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification, in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons. In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe. Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description, and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes. Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane, floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace. Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace, and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity. Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse, but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other. An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background —a soup of radiation throughout our universe, 
that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era. So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo. Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description, or be replaced by something else. As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models. While these models are inspired and 
guided by many scientific experiments, there are very few objective experiments 
to directly test them, yet. Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along, scientists will likely be left to argue about 
the elegance of their competing models… and continue to dream about what, 
if anything, lies beyond our universe.

**Transcript**:
The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang nearly fourteen billion
years ago, and has been expanding 
ever since. But what is it expanding into? That's a complicated question. Here's why: Einstein's equations of
general relativity describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected fabric for the universe. This means that what we know of
as space and time exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it. Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out into more space. But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into, what does expanding 
even mean? In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations gave us a definitive answer. His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies recede, or move away,
from the Earth. Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes. How can we interpret this? Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven. The batter rises by the same
amount in between each and every raisin. If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies, and batter as the space
between them, we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other, and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger distance than the nearby ones in the same amount of time. Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion. It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding 
unto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory

**Transcript**:
You spend weeks studying 
for an important test. On the big day, you wait nervously
as your teacher hands it out. You’re working your way through, 
when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’ You know you’ve seen it before, 
but your mind goes blank. What just happened? The answer lies in 
the complex relationship between stress and memory. There are many types 
and degrees of stress and different kinds of memory, but we’re going to focus on 
how short-term stress impacts your memory for facts. To start, it helps to understand 
how this kind of memory works. Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through
a process with three main steps. First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter
a new piece of information. Each sensory experience activates 
a unique set of brain areas. In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated 
by the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences 
associated with strong emotions. The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening 
the synaptic connections stimulated during 
the original sensory experience. Once a memory has been encoded, it can be remembered, 
or retrieved, later. Memories are stored all over the brain, and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex 
that signals for their retrieval. So how does stress 
affect each of these stages? In the first two stages, moderate stress can actually 
help experiences enter your memory. Your brain responds to stressful stimuli by releasing hormones 
known as corticosteroids, which activate a process 
of threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala. The amygdala prompts your hippocampus to consolidate the stress-inducing 
experience into a memory. Meanwhile, the flood 
of corticosteroids from stress stimulates your hippocampus, also prompting memory consolidation. But even though some stress 
can be helpful, extreme and chronic stress 
can have the opposite effect. Researchers have tested this by injecting
rats directly with stress hormones. As they gradually increased 
the dose of corticosteroids, the rats’ performance on
memory tests increased at first, but dropped off at higher doses. In humans, we see a similar 
positive effect with moderate stress. But that only appears when 
the stress is related to the memory task— so while time pressure might 
help you memorize a list, having a friend scare you will not. And the weeks, months, or even years of sustained corticosteroids 
that result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability 
to form new memories. It would be nice if some stress 
also helped us remember facts, but unfortunately, the opposite is true. The act of remembering relies 
on the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought, 
attention, and reasoning. When corticosteroids 
stimulate the amygdala, the amygdala inhibits, 
or lessens the activity of, the prefrontal cortex. The reason for this inhibition
is so the fight/flight/freeze response can overrule slower, more reasoned 
thought in a dangerous situation. But that can also have 
the unfortunate effect of making your mind 
go blank during a test. And then the act of trying to remember
can itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle 
of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering. So what can you do to turn stress 
to your advantage and stay calm and collected 
when it matters the most? First, if you know a stressful
situation like a test is coming, try preparing in conditions similar 
to the stressful environment. Novelty can be a stressor. Completing practice questions 
under time pressure, or seated at a desk 
rather than on a couch, can make your stress response
to these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself. Exercise is another useful tool. Increasing your heart 
and breathing rate is linked to chemical changes 
in your brain that help reduce anxiety 
and increase your sense of well-being. Regular exercise is also widely 
thought to improve sleeping patterns, which comes in handy 
the night before a test. And on the actual test day, try taking deep breaths to counteract 
your body’s flight/fight/freeze response. Deep breathing exercises have shown
measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from
third graders to nursing students. So the next time you find your mind 
going blank at a critical moment, take a few deep breaths 
until you remember ataraxia: a state of calmness, free from anxiety.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the question content is not identical, the intent and options of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks what shouldn't be done to help stay calm and collected, and the correct option is preparing in comfortable positions. Question 7 asks what can be done to reduce the stress response to a test, and the correct option is completing practice questions under time pressure, which is similar to preparing in conditions similar to the stressful environment. However, option A in Question 7, "Studying in a completely new environment," is the opposite of what is suggested in the transcript and can be considered as something that shouldn't be done, making it similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more suitable match can be constructed by transforming the generated MCQs. For example, by transforming Question 7 into "What shouldn't you do to reduce the stress response to a test?" and changing the options accordingly, we can create a more similar MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You spend weeks studying 
for an important test. On the big day, you wait nervously
as your teacher hands it out. You’re working your way through, 
when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’ You know you’ve seen it before, 
but your mind goes blank. What just happened? The answer lies in 
the complex relationship between stress and memory. There are many types 
and degrees of stress and different kinds of memory, but we’re going to focus on 
how short-term stress impacts your memory for facts. To start, it helps to understand 
how this kind of memory works. Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through
a process with three main steps. First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter
a new piece of information. Each sensory experience activates 
a unique set of brain areas. In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated 
by the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences 
associated with strong emotions. The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening 
the synaptic connections stimulated during 
the original sensory experience. Once a memory has been encoded, it can be remembered, 
or retrieved, later. Memories are stored all over the brain, and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex 
that signals for their retrieval. So how does stress 
affect each of these stages? In the first two stages, moderate stress can actually 
help experiences enter your memory. Your brain responds to stressful stimuli by releasing hormones 
known as corticosteroids, which activate a process 
of threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala. The amygdala prompts your hippocampus to consolidate the stress-inducing 
experience into a memory. Meanwhile, the flood 
of corticosteroids from stress stimulates your hippocampus, also prompting memory consolidation. But even though some stress 
can be helpful, extreme and chronic stress 
can have the opposite effect. Researchers have tested this by injecting
rats directly with stress hormones. As they gradually increased 
the dose of corticosteroids, the rats’ performance on
memory tests increased at first, but dropped off at higher doses. In humans, we see a similar 
positive effect with moderate stress. But that only appears when 
the stress is related to the memory task— so while time pressure might 
help you memorize a list, having a friend scare you will not. And the weeks, months, or even years of sustained corticosteroids 
that result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability 
to form new memories. It would be nice if some stress 
also helped us remember facts, but unfortunately, the opposite is true. The act of remembering relies 
on the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought, 
attention, and reasoning. When corticosteroids 
stimulate the amygdala, the amygdala inhibits, 
or lessens the activity of, the prefrontal cortex. The reason for this inhibition
is so the fight/flight/freeze response can overrule slower, more reasoned 
thought in a dangerous situation. But that can also have 
the unfortunate effect of making your mind 
go blank during a test. And then the act of trying to remember
can itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle 
of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering. So what can you do to turn stress 
to your advantage and stay calm and collected 
when it matters the most? First, if you know a stressful
situation like a test is coming, try preparing in conditions similar 
to the stressful environment. Novelty can be a stressor. Completing practice questions 
under time pressure, or seated at a desk 
rather than on a couch, can make your stress response
to these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself. Exercise is another useful tool. Increasing your heart 
and breathing rate is linked to chemical changes 
in your brain that help reduce anxiety 
and increase your sense of well-being. Regular exercise is also widely 
thought to improve sleeping patterns, which comes in handy 
the night before a test. And on the actual test day, try taking deep breaths to counteract 
your body’s flight/fight/freeze response. Deep breathing exercises have shown
measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from
third graders to nursing students. So the next time you find your mind 
going blank at a critical moment, take a few deep breaths 
until you remember ataraxia: a state of calmness, free from anxiety.

**Transcript**:
One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco
for a vacation with his family, Colombian journalist Gabriel García 
Márquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the
family’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book 
had suddenly come to him: “Many years later, 
as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember 
that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom 
into One Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on 
to bring Latin American literature to the forefront 
of the global imagination, earning García Márquez 
the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude 
so remarkable? The novel chronicles the fortunes
and misfortunes of the Buendía family 
over seven generations. With its lush, detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is not an easy book to read. But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment 
of intense romances, civil war, political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters 
named Aureliano than you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is one of the most famous examples of a literary genre 
known as magical realism. Here, supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic 
and matter-of-fact tone, while the real events of human life 
and history reveal themselves 
to be full of fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the
fictional village of Macondo intertwine seamlessly with events taking
place in the real country of Colombia. The settlement begins 
in a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed 
to the outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, 
characters grow old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated 
in the next generation. When the American fruit company 
comes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is
always followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves forward 
through subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many characters have similar names 
and features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often repeat. Strange prophecies 
and visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes 
and firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens 
a plantation near the village and ends up massacring thousands 
of striking workers, mirroring the real-life 
‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this produces a sense 
of history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape. Beneath the magic is a story 
about the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history 
from colonial times onward. This is a history that 
the author experienced firsthand. Gabriel García Márquez grew up
in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its Conservative 
and Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and covered the 1958 Venezuelan 
coup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest influences 
were his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a
decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against
Colombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez 
to a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’
omnipresent superstition became the foundation 
of One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca 
where the author spent his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez 
found a unique way to capture the unique history 
of Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality 
of living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive 
the tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism,
the novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected 
on Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the
possibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able
to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned 
to one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever,
a second chance on earth."

decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against
Colombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez

found a unique way to capture the unique history 
of Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality 
of living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive 
the tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism,
the novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected 
on Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the
possibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able
to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned

One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco

Márquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the
family’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book

You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s 
secret vault, secured by a series of combination locks. Fortunately, your treasure map 
has three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm. The last one appears to be missing. Looks like you’re gonna have 
to figure it out on your own. There’s something those 
first two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called 
autobiographical numbers. This is a special type of number 
whose structure describes itself. Each of an autobiographical
number’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that
position occurs within the number. The first digit indicates 
the quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates 
the number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, 
and so on until the end. The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit
autobiographical number. What is it? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations 
would take forever. So let’s analyze the autobiographical 
numbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find. By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits. This makes sense 
since each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific 
digit occurs within the total. So the digits in our 
ten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten. This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have 
too many large digits. For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would 
have to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits. We can conclude 
that there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 
in the entire sequence. So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut. And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers 
that aren’t used. So now we know that our number
must contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater. Now, while this first digit counts 
the number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times
a particular non-zero digit occurs. If we add together 
all the digits besides the first one – and remember, 
zeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many 
non-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit. For example, 
if we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits. Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero 
digits there are after the first digit – two, in our example. Why go through all that? Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits
that occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, 
minus one. And how can you get a distribution
where the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together? The only way is for one 
of the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s. How many 1s? Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional 
digits like 3 or 4 to count them. So now we have the leading digit of 3 
or greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit. And speaking of that, it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is. Since we know that the 2 
and the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6. Now it’s just a matter 
of putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines. The safe swings open, 
and inside you find... Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and theme.

The ground truth MCQ asks about identifying another autobiographical number with 4 digits, whereas the generated MCQs focus on understanding the properties and characteristics of autobiographical numbers.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1: "What type of number is described in the transcript as having a structure that describes itself?" This question is related to the concept of autobiographical numbers, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. If you're looking for a direct match, I would recommend generating new MCQs that specifically target the concept of identifying autobiographical numbers.

**Transcript**:
You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s 
secret vault, secured by a series of combination locks. Fortunately, your treasure map 
has three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm. The last one appears to be missing. Looks like you’re gonna have 
to figure it out on your own. There’s something those 
first two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called 
autobiographical numbers. This is a special type of number 
whose structure describes itself. Each of an autobiographical
number’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that
position occurs within the number. The first digit indicates 
the quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates 
the number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, 
and so on until the end. The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit
autobiographical number. What is it? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations 
would take forever. So let’s analyze the autobiographical 
numbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find. By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits. This makes sense

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ appears to be a puzzle or riddle that requires the test-taker to figure out the correct answer based on the given options, whereas the generated MCQs are more focused on testing the understanding of autobiographical numbers and their properties.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 10 is the most similar. This is because Question 10 asks about the correct sequence of the autobiographical number, which is a 10-digit number that is the solution to the puzzle presented in the transcript. The ground truth MCQ also seems to be asking for a specific number or code, although the context and options are different.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Transcript**:
You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s 
secret vault, secured by a series of combination locks. Fortunately, your treasure map 
has three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm. The last one appears to be missing. Looks like you’re gonna have 
to figure it out on your own. There’s something those 
first two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called 
autobiographical numbers. This is a special type of number 
whose structure describes itself. Each of an autobiographical
number’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that
position occurs within the number. The first digit indicates 
the quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates 
the number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, 
and so on until the end. The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit
autobiographical number. What is it? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations 
would take forever. So let’s analyze the autobiographical 
numbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find. By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits. This makes sense 
since each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific 
digit occurs within the total. So the digits in our 
ten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten. This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have 
too many large digits. For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would 
have to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits. We can conclude 
that there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 
in the entire sequence. So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut. And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers 
that aren’t used. So now we know that our number
must contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater. Now, while this first digit counts 
the number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times
a particular non-zero digit occurs. If we add together 
all the digits besides the first one – and remember, 
zeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many 
non-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit. For example, 
if we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits. Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero 
digits there are after the first digit – two, in our example. Why go through all that? Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits
that occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, 
minus one. And how can you get a distribution
where the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together? The only way is for one 
of the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s. How many 1s? Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional 
digits like 3 or 4 to count them. So now we have the leading digit of 3 
or greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit. And speaking of that, it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is. Since we know that the 2 
and the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6. Now it’s just a matter 
of putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines. The safe swings open, 
and inside you find... Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest some generated MCQs that are related to the concept of autobiographical numbers, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The most similar generated MCQs are:

* Question 2: In an autobiographical number, what does the first digit indicate? (related to the concept of autobiographical numbers, but not exactly matching the ground truth MCQ)
* Question 4: What can be concluded about the autobiographical number by adding all its digits together? (related to the properties of autobiographical numbers, but not exactly matching the ground truth MCQ)

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ's specific question about counting the number of 4-digit numbers where the first digit equals the number of zeros.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ, but it's still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
At the annual Athenian 
drama festival in 426 BC, a comic play called The Babylonians, written by a young poet 
named Aristophanes, was awarded first prize. But the play’s depiction of Athens’ 
conduct during the Peloponnesian War was so controversial that afterwards, a politician named Kleon 
took Aristophanes to court for "slandering the people of Athens 
in the presence of foreigners." Aristophanes struck back two years later
with a play called The Knights. In it, he openly mocked Kleon, ending with Kleon’s character working as 
a lowly sausage seller outside the city gates. This style of satire was a consequence of the unrestricted democracy 
of 5th century Athens and is now called "Old Comedy." Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest 
surviving comic dramas, are stuffed full of parodies, songs, 
sexual jokes, and surreal fantasy. They often use wild situations, like a hero flying to heaven 
on a dung beetle, or a net cast over a house to keep 
the owner’s father trapped inside, in order to subvert audience expectations. And they’ve shaped how comedy’s
been written and performed ever since. The word "comedy" comes from 
the Ancient Greek "komos," – revel, and "oide," – singing, and it differed from its companion 
art form, "tragedy" in many ways. Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt 
with the downfall of the high and mighty, their comedies usually ended happily. And where tragedy almost always 
borrowed stories from legend, comedy addressed current events. Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary
people and attacked the powerful. His targets were arrogant politicians, war-mongering generals, and self-important intellectuals, exactly the people who sat in 
the front row of the theatre, where everyone could see their reactions. As a result, they were referred to 
as komoidoumenoi: "those made fun of in comedy." Aristophanes’ vicious 
and often obscene mockery held these leaders to account,
testing their commitment to the city. One issue, in particular, 
inspired much of Aristophanes’ work: the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta. In Peace, written in 421 BC, a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave, where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians. Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC, Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata." In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace. Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations, such as in "Clouds," where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking. The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school, where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right and that a debt is not a debt. No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end. Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis, a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly, often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes. For example, in "Birds," the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize, they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city. Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke, as the play came in second. By exploring new ideas and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society, Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens, but he shaped the nature of comedy itself. Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy, his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere, from slapstick to double acts to impersonations to political satire. Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes, his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed. And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC 
still resonates today: “I’m a comedian, 
so I’ll speak about justice, no matter how hard 
it sounds to your ears.”

inspired much of Aristophanes’ work: the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta. In Peace, written in 421 BC, a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave, where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians. Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC, Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata." In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace. Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations, such as in "Clouds," where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking. The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school, where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right and that a debt is not a debt. No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end. Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis, a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly, often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes. For example, in "Birds," the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize, they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city. Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke, as the play came in second. By exploring new ideas and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society, Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens, but he shaped the nature of comedy itself. Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy, his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere, from slapstick to double acts to impersonations to political satire. Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes, his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed. And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC 
still resonates today: “I’m a comedian, 
so I’ll speak about justice, no matter how hard 
it sounds to your ears.”

**Transcript**:
At the annual Athenian 
drama festival in 426 BC, a comic play called The Babylonians, written by a young poet 
named Aristophanes, was awarded first prize. But the play’s depiction of Athens’ 
conduct during the Peloponnesian War was so controversial that afterwards, a politician named Kleon 
took Aristophanes to court for "slandering the people of Athens 
in the presence of foreigners." Aristophanes struck back two years later
with a play called The Knights. In it, he openly mocked Kleon, ending with Kleon’s character working as 
a lowly sausage seller outside the city gates. This style of satire was a consequence of the unrestricted democracy 
of 5th century Athens and is now called "Old Comedy." Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest 
surviving comic dramas, are stuffed full of parodies, songs, 
sexual jokes, and surreal fantasy. They often use wild situations, like a hero flying to heaven 
on a dung beetle, or a net cast over a house to keep 
the owner’s father trapped inside, in order to subvert audience expectations. And they’ve shaped how comedy’s
been written and performed ever since. The word "comedy" comes from 
the Ancient Greek "komos," – revel, and "oide," – singing, and it differed from its companion 
art form, "tragedy" in many ways. Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt 
with the downfall of the high and mighty, their comedies usually ended happily. And where tragedy almost always 
borrowed stories from legend, comedy addressed current events. Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary
people and attacked the powerful. His targets were arrogant politicians, war-mongering generals, and self-important intellectuals, exactly the people who sat in 
the front row of the theatre, where everyone could see their reactions. As a result, they were referred to 
as komoidoumenoi: "those made fun of in comedy." Aristophanes’ vicious 
and often obscene mockery held these leaders to account,

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the question and options of the ground truth MCQ do not have a direct match among the generated MCQs, I will choose the one that has the closest relation to the subject matter.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a play that is NOT written by Aristophanes. Question 8 asks about a play where Aristophanes mocked fashionable philosophical thinking, but it does provide information about Aristophanes' plays.

A more suitable approach would be to look for a generated MCQ that provides information about the plays written by Aristophanes. Question 1 is a good candidate, as it asks about the name of a comic play written by Aristophanes.

Considering this, I would choose Question 1 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it provides information about Aristophanes' plays and allows the reader to infer which one might NOT be written by him.

**Transcript**:
How do we explain the unexplainable? This question has inspired numerous myths, religious practices, and scientific inquiries. But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout 
China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question – why do we need an explanation? For these monks, blindly seeking answers 
was a vice to overcome, and learning to accept
the mysteries of existence was the true path to enlightenment. But fighting the urge to explain 
the unexplainable can be difficult. So to help practice living 
with these mysteries, the meditating monks used a collection 
of roughly 1,700 bewildering and ambiguous philosophical
thought experiments called kōans. The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case." But unlike real-world court cases,
kōans were intentionally incomprehensible. They were surprising, surreal, 
and frequently contradicted themselves. On the surface, they contained a proverb
about the Zen Buddhist monastic code - such as living without physical
or mental attachments, avoiding binary thinking, and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature." But by framing those lessons 
as illogical anecdotes, they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox. By puzzling through 
these confusing “cases," meditating monks could both internalize 
and practice Buddhist teachings. Hopefully, they would let go 
of the search for one true answer and trigger a spiritual breakthrough. Since these are intentionally 
unexplainable, it would be misguided to try 
and decipher these stories ourselves. But like the monks before us, we can puzzle over them together, and investigate just how resistant
they are to simple explanations. Consider this kōan illustrating the
practice of no-attachment. Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido,
are traveling together down a muddy road. Ahead they see an attractive traveler,
unable to cross the muddy path. Tanzan politely offers his help, carrying the traveler 
on his back across the street, and placing her down without a word. Ekido was shocked. According to monastic law,
monks were not supposed to go near women, let alone touch a beautiful stranger. After miles of walking,
Ekido could no longer restrain himself. “How could you carry that woman?” Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there.
Are you still carrying her?” Like all kōans, 
this story has numerous interpretations. But one popular reading suggests that despite never having 
physically carried the traveler, Ekido broke monastic law 
by mentally "clinging to" the woman. This type of conflict – examining the grey area between the letter
of the law and the spirit of the law – was common in kōans. In addition to exploring ambiguity, kōans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding 
of the world around them. One such example finds three monks debating a temple flag 
rippling in the wind. The first monk refers to 
the flag as a moving banner, while the second monk insists 
that they are not seeing the flag move, but rather the wind blowing. They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes, “It is not the flag moving, 
nor the wind blowing, but rather the movement of your minds!” One interpretation of this kōan plays on 
the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks – the first asserting the importance 
of the observable world, the second favoring deeper knowledge 
we can infer from that world. But each monk’s commitment 
to his own “answer” blinds him to the other’s insight, 
and in doing so, defies an essential Buddhist ideal:
abolishing binary thinking. The third monk identifies 
their conflict as a perceptual one – both arguing monks 
fail to see the larger picture. Of course, all these interpretations only
hint at how to wrestle with these kōans. Neither the wisdom 
from practicing monks before us, nor the supposedly wise characters 
in these stories can resolve them for you. That’s because the purpose of these kōans
isn’t reaching a simple solution. It’s the very act of struggling 
with these paradoxical puzzles which challenge our desire for resolution, and our understanding 
of understanding itself.

How do we explain the unexplainable? This question has inspired numerous myths, religious practices, and scientific inquiries. But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout 
China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question – why do we need an explanation? For these monks, blindly seeking answers 
was a vice to overcome, and learning to accept
the mysteries of existence was the true path to enlightenment. But fighting the urge to explain 
the unexplainable can be difficult. So to help practice living 
with these mysteries, the meditating monks used a collection 
of roughly 1,700 bewildering and ambiguous philosophical
thought experiments called kōans. The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case." But unlike real-world court cases,
kōans were intentionally incomprehensible. They were surprising, surreal, 
and frequently contradicted themselves. On the surface, they contained a proverb
about the Zen Buddhist monastic code - such as living without physical
or mental attachments, avoiding binary thinking, and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature." But by framing those lessons 
as illogical anecdotes, they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox. By puzzling through 
these confusing “cases," meditating monks could both internalize 
and practice Buddhist teachings. Hopefully, they would let go 
of the search for one true answer and trigger a spiritual breakthrough. Since these are intentionally 
unexplainable, it would be misguided to try 
and decipher these stories ourselves. But like the monks before us, we can puzzle over them together, and investigate just how resistant
they are to simple explanations. Consider this kōan illustrating the
practice of no-attachment. Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido,
are traveling together down a muddy road. Ahead they see an attractive traveler,
unable to cross the muddy path. Tanzan politely offers his help, carrying the traveler 
on his back across the street, and placing her down without a word. Ekido was shocked. According to monastic law,
monks were not supposed to go near women, let alone touch a beautiful stranger. After miles of walking,
Ekido could no longer restrain himself. “How could you carry that woman?” Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there.
Are you still carrying her?” Like all kōans,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3 and Question 6, however Question 6 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about a Buddhist ideal, which is to avoid or abolish binary thinking. Question 6 explores a common conflict in kōans, which includes the grey area between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law, and this conflict is related to the idea of abolishing binary thinking, as seen in the kōan about the temple flag.

However, it's worth noting that Question 3 also touches on the idea of binary thinking, as it mentions that kōans help monks internalize and practice Buddhist teachings by framing lessons as illogical anecdotes that test their ability to live with ambiguity and paradox, which is related to the idea of abolishing binary thinking.

But Question 6 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6.

of the law and the spirit of the law – was common in kōans. In addition to exploring ambiguity, kōans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding 
of the world around them. One such example finds three monks debating a temple flag 
rippling in the wind. The first monk refers to 
the flag as a moving banner, while the second monk insists 
that they are not seeing the flag move, but rather the wind blowing. They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes, “It is not the flag moving, 
nor the wind blowing, but rather the movement of your minds!” One interpretation of this kōan plays on 
the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks – the first asserting the importance 
of the observable world, the second favoring deeper knowledge 
we can infer from that world. But each monk’s commitment 
to his own “answer” blinds him to the other’s insight, 
and in doing so, defies an essential Buddhist ideal:
abolishing binary thinking. The third monk identifies 
their conflict as a perceptual one – both arguing monks 
fail to see the larger picture. Of course, all these interpretations only
hint at how to wrestle with these kōans. Neither the wisdom 
from practicing monks before us, nor the supposedly wise characters 
in these stories can resolve them for you. That’s because the purpose of these kōans
isn’t reaching a simple solution. It’s the very act of struggling 
with these paradoxical puzzles which challenge our desire for resolution, and our understanding 
of understanding itself.

**Transcript**:
2,300 years ago, the rulers of Alexandria 
set out to fulfill one of humanity’s most audacious goals: to collect all the knowledge in the world 
under one roof. In its prime, the Library of Alexandria housed 
an unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of 
the Greek world’s greatest minds. But by the end of the 5th century CE,
the great library had vanished. Many believed it was destroyed 
in a catastrophic fire. The truth of the library’s rise 
and fall is much more complex. The idea for the library came 
from Alexander the Great. After establishing himself as a conqueror, the former student of Aristotle 
turned his attention to building an empire of knowledge 
headquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built 
with grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are 
no surviving accounts of its architecture. We do know it had lecture halls, 
classrooms, and, of course, shelves. As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with
primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls. He invited scholars to live 
and study in Alexandria at his expense. The library grew as they contributed 
their own manuscripts, but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted 
a copy of every book in the world. Luckily, Alexandria was a hub for ships
traveling through the Mediterranean. Ptolemy III instituted a policy requiring 
any ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over its books for copying. Once the Library’s scribes 
had duplicated the texts, they kept the originals 
and sent the copies back to the ships. Hired book hunters also scoured 
the Mediterranean in search of new texts, and the rulers of Alexandria attempted 
to quash rivals by ending all exports of the Egyptian 
papyrus used to make scrolls. These efforts brought hundreds 
of thousands of books to Alexandria. As the library grew, it became possible to find information 
on more subjects than ever before, but also much more difficult to find 
information on any specific subject. Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of
Cyrene set to work on a solution, creating the pinakes, a 120-volume catalog 
of the library’s contents, the first of its kind. Using the pinakes, others were able to navigate 
the Library’s swelling collection. They made some astounding discoveries. 1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized 
the earth was round, but calculated its circumference 
and diameter within a few miles of their actual size. Heron of Alexandria created 
the world’s first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally reinvented during 
the Industrial Revolution. For about 300 years after its founding 
in 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar 
laid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire. For years, scholars believed the library 
burned as the blaze spread into the city. It's possible the fire destroyed 
part of the sprawling collection, but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit 
the library for centuries after the siege. Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared
as the city changed from Greek, to Roman, Christian, and eventually Muslim hands. Each new set of rulers viewed 
its contents as a threat rather than a source of pride. In 415 CE, the Christian rulers even had 
a mathematician named Hypatia murdered for studying 
the library’s ancient Greek texts, which they viewed as blasphemous. Though the Library of Alexandria 
and its countless texts are long gone, we’re still grappling 
with the best ways to collect, access, and preserve our knowledge. There’s more information available today and more advanced technology 
to preserve it, though we can’t know for sure that our digital archives 
will be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls. And even if our reservoirs of knowledge 
are physically secure, they will still have to resist 
the more insidious forces that tore the library apart: fear of knowledge, and the arrogant belief 
that the past is obsolete. The difference is that, this time, 
we know what to prepare for.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of books contained in the Library of Alexandria, and the correct answer is "Papyrus scrolls." While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 8 mentions the use of Egyptian papyrus to make scrolls, which is related to the type of books contained in the library.

However, a more relevant question that is somewhat related to the content of the ground truth MCQ is Question 9: "What can be inferred about the Library of Alexandria's architecture based on the transcript?" Options: A. It was built in a purely Greek style, B. It was built in a purely Egyptian style, C. It was a unique blend of Greek and Egyptian influences, D. There is no surviving account of its architecture Correct Option: D

But it mentions in the transcript "Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built with grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are no surviving accounts of its architecture." which then also says " As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls."

Therefore the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match but is  Question 8 or Question 9 however since question 8 and 9 do not match the content of the ground truth MCQ.

headquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built 
with grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are 
no surviving accounts of its architecture. We do know it had lecture halls, 
classrooms, and, of course, shelves. As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with
primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls. He invited scholars to live 
and study in Alexandria at his expense. The library grew as they contributed 
their own manuscripts, but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted 
a copy of every book in the world. Luckily, Alexandria was a hub for ships
traveling through the Mediterranean. Ptolemy III instituted a policy requiring 
any ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over its books for copying. Once the Library’s scribes 
had duplicated the texts, they kept the originals 
and sent the copies back to the ships. Hired book hunters also scoured 
the Mediterranean in search of new texts, and the rulers of Alexandria attempted 
to quash rivals by ending all exports of the Egyptian 
papyrus used to make scrolls. These efforts brought hundreds 
of thousands of books to Alexandria. As the library grew, it became possible to find information 
on more subjects than ever before, but also much more difficult to find 
information on any specific subject. Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of
Cyrene set to work on a solution, creating the pinakes, a 120-volume catalog 
of the library’s contents, the first of its kind. Using the pinakes, others were able to navigate 
the Library’s swelling collection. They made some astounding discoveries. 1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized 
the earth was round, but calculated its circumference 
and diameter within a few miles of their actual size. Heron of Alexandria created 
the world’s first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally reinvented during 
the Industrial Revolution. For about 300 years after its founding 
in 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar 
laid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire. For years, scholars believed the library 
burned as the blaze spread into the city. It's possible the fire destroyed 
part of the sprawling collection, but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit 
the library for centuries after the siege. Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared
as the city changed from Greek, to Roman, Christian, and eventually Muslim hands. Each new set of rulers viewed 
its contents as a threat rather than a source of pride. In 415 CE, the Christian rulers even had 
a mathematician named Hypatia murdered for studying 
the library’s ancient Greek texts, which they viewed as blasphemous. Though the Library of Alexandria 
and its countless texts are long gone, we’re still grappling 
with the best ways to collect, access, and preserve our knowledge. There’s more information available today and more advanced technology 
to preserve it, though we can’t know for sure that our digital archives 
will be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls. And even if our reservoirs of knowledge 
are physically secure, they will still have to resist 
the more insidious forces that tore the library apart: fear of knowledge, and the arrogant belief 
that the past is obsolete. The difference is that, this time, 
we know what to prepare for.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the ground truth MCQ asks about a scholar who did NOT study at the Library of Alexandria, and none of the generated MCQs have the same intent, I will choose the one that has the closest relation to the ground truth MCQ.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent. Question 6 asks about the name of the mathematician murdered by Christian rulers, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about a scholar who did NOT study at the Library of Alexandria.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but I want to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
2,300 years ago, the rulers of Alexandria 
set out to fulfill one of humanity’s most audacious goals: to collect all the knowledge in the world 
under one roof. In its prime, the Library of Alexandria housed 
an unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of 
the Greek world’s greatest minds. But by the end of the 5th century CE,
the great library had vanished. Many believed it was destroyed 
in a catastrophic fire. The truth of the library’s rise 
and fall is much more complex. The idea for the library came 
from Alexander the Great. After establishing himself as a conqueror, the former student of Aristotle 
turned his attention to building an empire of knowledge 
headquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 5. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses on a specific event (Julius Caesar's siege) rather than the overall destruction of the library.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but with some modifications to the question and options, it could better match the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose an index, I would say:

Index: 5

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the ground truth MCQ's content and intent would be more suitable.

Here's an example of a revised generated MCQ that better matches the ground truth MCQ:

Revised Generated MCQ:
Question: What ultimately led to the destruction of the Library of Alexandria?

**Transcript**:
- Narrator: Imagine giving
birth to a 24 pound baby. That's three times the size of an average human newborn. Ouch. But for kiwi birds, giant chicks are the norm. Females lay a single egg up
to 20% of their body weight, yet when you check out other extreme births
in the animal kingdom, the kiwi can consider itself lucky. Shingleback lizards also
have a tough pregnancy. These reptiles usually have
one to two babies at a time, which doesn't sound so bad, until you realize that combined, the babies make up a third
of the mother's body weight. That's like a human giving
birth to a seven year old! But a baby doesn't need
to be big to be difficult. Take the porcupine. Those sharp spines
protect it from predators, but they're sometimes not so fun for Mom. You see, baby porcupines,
called porcupettes, aren't hairless like most rodent newborns. These guys are born fully quilled. Normally, this isn't a problem for Mom, since the quills are soft at birth, and gradually harden
over the next few hours. But complications can arise when the porcupettes are
facing the wrong direction, because their quills can get caught in the birth canal on the way out. Speaking of birth canals, the spotted hyena has an interesting one. Females have phallic-like genitalia. The scientific term for
this is pseudo-penis, and they give birth out
of the pseudo-penis, which will sometimes rip
apart in the process. It's not only painful, it can be lethal. In fact, about 15% of first-time
mothers die giving birth. But, believe it or not, a species of velvet
spider has it even worse. You know how some animals
chew up food for their babies? Well, Stegodyphus lineatus
takes this to a whole new level. Right after she lays an egg sac, the mother's tissues start to degrade. Once the spiderlings hatch, she regurgitates her
own liquified insides, and the babies chow down. Nine days later, they suck
up the last of her fluids, and strike out on their own, leaving nothing but an empty husk. Thanks Mom. But childbirth isn't just dangerous or uncomfortable for mothers. With some animals, the
baby has it pretty rough. Take the Tasmanian devil. The mom gives birth to
up to 50 joeys at a time, each the size of a raisin. They have to crawl from
the mother's birth canal, over her body, and into her pouch, where they'll snuggle up
for another four months. But there's a catch. Mom has only four nipples in her pouch. So right from birth the joeys are literally on
a mad dash for their lives, and only the strongest four will make it. Talk about sibling rivalry, huh? Overall, one thing is clear: humans aren't the only
ones who have it rough when it comes to giving birth. What's the craziest animal fact you know? Tell us in the comments
and thanks for watching.

Check out that building with a hole in
it. Here in Hong Kong there are dragons
floating everywhere. You can't really see them, because you know they're dragons.
They actually live up in the mountains and they come down into the water and
when you block them from entering the water you end up really messing up your
luck. So they have accommodated this situation by putting holes in the
buildings so that the dragons can fly through. These are called dragon gates
and they are one of many examples of how Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese practice,
is affecting the skyline of Hong Kong. So Feng Shui is this ancient Chinese
belief, superstition. The basic idea is that there is good energy out there
floating around, good luck, good fortune called Qi and if you arrange your
physical environment in an optimal way, you can channel that good luck in the
best way and things will go good for you. This usually takes the form of like
furniture, interior design but here in Hong Kong, it has affected the skyline. Alright, first let's look at this HSBC
building. The Hong Kong Shanghai Bank was founded back in the days of pirates and
opium barons. First thing you'll notice is that it's nicely squared off, with the
mountains in the back and harbor in the front. This is really good composition for the Qi to flow. Not only is the lobby
elevated but it's also the escalators are at this angle. It's kind of a weird
looking angle. That's intentional as well, because it's actually meant to fend off
the bad luck as it's coming through this hole in the bottom of the building. And then of course the opposite is true; if you don't arrange your physical
environment in an optimal way, then bad luck will befall you. Right next door is
the Communist Bank of Red China. The developers of this building explicitly
ignored the Feng Shui masters who were concerned that the sharp angles of this
design would cut the good Qi and create bad luck for all of the surrounding
buildings. The people who thought this had their suspicions reinforced when
shortly after the building was complete, bad stuff started happening around it. Like to this neighboring building, which has been riddled with financial insecurity, corporate collapse, bankruptcies, since it's very beginning. And Feng Shui
masters have come out and cited the bad Feng Shui of the area as a major cause
for these events. Governor of Hong Kong at the time, whose house sits in the
shadow of this building, died of a fatal heart attack just one year after this
building was complete. So the HSBC building, in response, put up these
maintenance cranes that actually look like cannons and they're pointed right
at the Bank of China, in order to combat all of this bad luck that's coming from
this sharp building. When developers are designing and
putting up these buildings, they hire these Feng Shui consultants. They spend
millions of dollars on consultants who will give them advice and approve their
design decisions, to make sure that they're in keeping with good Feng Shui. Out here in Disneyland Hong Kong, the Feng Shui masters said that the entrance
was in a bad position for keeping good luck in the park. So they shifted the entrance by 12 degrees in order to create a blockade
from the good luck escaping the park and ruining the prosperity of this place. Feng Shui comes from China, mainland China, but during the Cultural Revolution
China kind of stamped out some of these old practices that they believed were
holding the society back. And Feng Shui fell victim to that, but Hong Kong at
that time was ruled by the British. It was a British colony, so it didn't fall
subject to that Cultural Revolution and Feng Shui was preserved in a very
mainstream way. Check out this building, it's the Hopewell Center. When this thing went up, people freaked out because it kind of looked like a candle or like a
smoking cigarette. They put a swimming pool on the top, in order to extinguish
the fire and make sure that it didn't mess with the good luck of the city. The government takes this stuff really seriously too. Between 2011 and 2016 they
paid out $1.1 million dollars in Feng Shui disturbance subsidies. This is paid
out to people who complain that new constructions disrupt their Fung Shui
and they get compensated by the government. So next time you are crossing
this harbor to look at these beautiful buildings, just remember that Feng Shui is at
is at play in Hong Kong's skyline.

**Transcript**:
Check out that building with a hole in
it. Here in Hong Kong there are dragons
floating everywhere. You can't really see them, because you know they're dragons.
They actually live up in the mountains and they come down into the water and
when you block them from entering the water you end up really messing up your
luck. So they have accommodated this situation by putting holes in the
buildings so that the dragons can fly through. These are called dragon gates
and they are one of many examples of how Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese practice,
is affecting the skyline of Hong Kong. So Feng Shui is this ancient Chinese
belief, superstition. The basic idea is that there is good energy out there
floating around, good luck, good fortune called Qi and if you arrange your
physical environment in an optimal way, you can channel that good luck in the
best way and things will go good for you. This usually takes the form of like
furniture, interior design but here in Hong Kong, it has affected the skyline. Alright, first let's look at this HSBC
building. The Hong Kong Shanghai Bank was founded back in the days of pirates and
opium barons. First thing you'll notice is that it's nicely squared off, with the
mountains in the back and harbor in the front. This is really good composition for the Qi to flow. Not only is the lobby
elevated but it's also the escalators are at this angle. It's kind of a weird
looking angle. That's intentional as well, because it's actually meant to fend off
the bad luck as it's coming through this hole in the bottom of the building. And then of course the opposite is true; if you don't arrange your physical
environment in an optimal way, then bad luck will befall you. Right next door is
the Communist Bank of Red China. The developers of this building explicitly
ignored the Feng Shui masters who were concerned that the sharp angles of this
design would cut the good Qi and create bad luck for all of the surrounding

**Transcript**:
As of 2018, there are around 
2.5 billion smartphone users in the world. If we broke open all their newest phones, which are just a fraction 
of the total that’ve been built, and split them into their component parts, that would produce 
around 85,000 kilograms of gold, 875,000 of silver, and 40 million kilograms of copper. How did this precious cache 
get into our phones, and can we reclaim it? Gold, silver, and copper 
are actually just a few of the 70 or so chemical elements 
that make up the average smartphone. These can be divided 
into different groups, two of the most critical 
being rare earth elements and precious metals. Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements
that are actually common in Earth’s crust and are found in many areas across 
the world in low concentrations. These elements have a huge
range of magnetic, phosphorescent, and conductive properties that make them crucial 
to modern technologies. In fact, of the 17 types 
of rare earth metals, phones and other electronics 
may contain up to 16. In smartphones, these create the screen 
and color display, aid conductivity, and produce the signature vibrations, amongst other things. And yet, crucial as they are, extracting these elements from the earth is linked to some disturbing 
environmental impacts. Rare earth elements can often be found, but in many areas, it’s not economically feasible 
to extract them due to low concentrations. Much of the time, extracting them requires 
a method called open pit mining that exposes vast areas of land. This form of mining destroys 
huge swaths of natural habitats, and causes air and water pollution, threatening the health 
of nearby communities. Another group of ingredients 
in smartphones comes with similar environmental risks: these are metals such as copper, silver, palladium, aluminum, platinum, tungsten, tin, lead, and gold. We also mine magnesium, lithium, silica, and potassium to make phones, and all of it is associated 
with vast habitat destruction, as well as air and water pollution. Mining comes with 
worrying social problems, too, like large-scale human 
and animal displacement to make way for industrial operations, and frequently, 
poor working conditions for laborers. Lastly, phone production 
also requires petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. That entwines our smartphones inextricably
with this growing planetary conundrum. And, what’s more, the ingredients we mine 
to make our phones aren’t infinite. One day, they’ll simply run out, and we haven’t yet discovered effective 
replacements for some. Despite this, the number of smartphones 
is on a steady increase; by 2019 it’s predicted that 
there’ll be close to 3 billion in use. This means that reclaiming the bounty 
within our phones is swiftly becoming a necessity. So, if you have an old phone, you might want to consider your options 
before throwing it away. To minimize waste, you could donate it 
to a charity for reuse, take it to an e-waste recycling facility, or look for a company 
that refurbishes old models. However, even recycling companies 
need our scrutiny. Just as the production of smartphones comes with social 
and environmental problems, dismantling them does too. E-waste is sometimes intentionally 
exported to countries where labor is cheap 
but working conditions are poor. Vast workforces, 
often made up of women and children, may be underpaid, lack the training 
to safely disassemble phones, and be exposed to elements 
like lead and mercury, which can permanently damage 
their nervous systems. Phone waste can also end up 
in huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals 
into the soil and water, mirroring the problems of the mines 
where the elements originated. A phone is much more than it appears 
to be on the surface. It’s an assemblage of elements
from multiple countries, linked to impacts 
that are unfolding on a global scale. So, until someone invents 
a completely sustainable smartphone, we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology
affects widespread places and people.

and color display, aid conductivity, and produce the signature vibrations, amongst other things. And yet, crucial as they are, extracting these elements from the earth is linked to some disturbing 
environmental impacts. Rare earth elements can often be found, but in many areas, it’s not economically feasible 
to extract them due to low concentrations. Much of the time, extracting them requires 
a method called open pit mining that exposes vast areas of land. This form of mining destroys 
huge swaths of natural habitats, and causes air and water pollution, threatening the health 
of nearby communities. Another group of ingredients 
in smartphones comes with similar environmental risks: these are metals such as copper, silver, palladium, aluminum, platinum, tungsten, tin, lead, and gold. We also mine magnesium, lithium, silica, and potassium to make phones, and all of it is associated 
with vast habitat destruction, as well as air and water pollution. Mining comes with 
worrying social problems, too, like large-scale human 
and animal displacement to make way for industrial operations, and frequently, 
poor working conditions for laborers. Lastly, phone production 
also requires petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. That entwines our smartphones inextricably
with this growing planetary conundrum. And, what’s more, the ingredients we mine 
to make our phones aren’t infinite. One day, they’ll simply run out, and we haven’t yet discovered effective 
replacements for some. Despite this, the number of smartphones 
is on a steady increase; by 2019 it’s predicted that 
there’ll be close to 3 billion in use. This means that reclaiming the bounty 
within our phones is swiftly becoming a necessity. So, if you have an old phone, you might want to consider your options 
before throwing it away. To minimize waste, you could donate it 
to a charity for reuse, take it to an e-waste recycling facility, or look for a company 
that refurbishes old models. However, even recycling companies 
need our scrutiny. Just as the production of smartphones comes with social 
and environmental problems, dismantling them does too. E-waste is sometimes intentionally 
exported to countries where labor is cheap 
but working conditions are poor. Vast workforces, 
often made up of women and children, may be underpaid, lack the training 
to safely disassemble phones, and be exposed to elements 
like lead and mercury, which can permanently damage 
their nervous systems. Phone waste can also end up 
in huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals 
into the soil and water, mirroring the problems of the mines 
where the elements originated. A phone is much more than it appears 
to be on the surface. It’s an assemblage of elements
from multiple countries, linked to impacts 
that are unfolding on a global scale. So, until someone invents 
a completely sustainable smartphone, we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology
affects widespread places and people.

**Transcript**:
As of 2018, there are around 
2.5 billion smartphone users in the world. If we broke open all their newest phones, which are just a fraction 
of the total that’ve been built, and split them into their component parts, that would produce 
around 85,000 kilograms of gold, 875,000 of silver, and 40 million kilograms of copper. How did this precious cache 
get into our phones, and can we reclaim it? Gold, silver, and copper 
are actually just a few of the 70 or so chemical elements 
that make up the average smartphone. These can be divided 
into different groups, two of the most critical 
being rare earth elements and precious metals. Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements
that are actually common in Earth’s crust and are found in many areas across 
the world in low concentrations. These elements have a huge
range of magnetic, phosphorescent, and conductive properties that make them crucial 
to modern technologies. In fact, of the 17 types 
of rare earth metals, phones and other electronics

want to think about this, but over 3500 species of cockroaches live on this planet. The good news? Only about 30 of those species have adapted to live around humans. The bad news? 30 species of cockroaches
can live around us! Roaches are one of the most
common pests in the US. So it's no surprise that humans are always trying to kill them. But no matter how many
times we stomp them, squash them, and bomb
them with toxic chemicals, these pesky pests always seem
to pop up time and time again. So what's going on? Let's take a closer look at the roach you probably know better than you'd like. Periplaneta Americana. Aka, the American Cockroach. But this name is misleading. This guy is actually
from Africa, not America. It made its way to the US by infesting boats in the 16th century, and it's been spreading to
almost every corner in the world ever since. It turns out, it's one of the largest
species of cockroach around. But that's not the only
big thing about it. New research has revealed
that it has a massive genome. One of the largest of any studied insect. And may of these genes are
exactly what make this roach a master survivor. Let's start with the genes associated with something called Chemoreception. That's how roaches smell
and taste their environment. Turns out they're actually way better at sniffing out and eating
food than most other insects. The American roach has 154
olfactory receptors for smell, and 544 gustatory receptors for taste. More than any other insect on the planet. As a result, these cockroaches
are not picky eaters. Sure, they like cheese, meat
and sugar like the rest of us, but they'll also go for
things like cardboard, book bindings, human
toenails, rotting meat, blood, excrement, and even each other. That's right, these
roaches have been known to eat other dead or crippled cockroaches, all in the name of survival. It sounds gross, but this diverse diet makes it easy to find a
meal just about anywhere, even if it's poisonous to most animals. This roach has a bunch of
genes called Cytochrome P450s, which help it withstand
poisonous chemicals, like peppermint. These genes code for
detoxification enzymes, which keep the insect safe. On top of that, this roach has
a super-strong immune system that seeks out and kills
harmful microbes and fungi, making the most unsanitary environment look like a five-start hotel
to the American cockroach. Not gross enough yet? Well consider this. Cockroaches can live nearly
a week without their heads. Yeah, that's not a myth. They don't have a highly
pressurized network of blood vessels like humans,
so they don't bleed out. Instead, their necks actually
seal off the opening. They can't regenerate a whole head, but roaches to have an impressive set of regenerative superpowers. For up to the first two years of its life, the American roach goes through a series of regenerative molts as
it matures into an adult. During a single molt stage,
it can replace lost limbs. And over a series of molts,
it can regrow antennae and even its eyes. Roaches may be hard to kill, but there's an easy way to keep
them clear of your kitchen. Cleanliness. A roach just won't survive
in unsanitary conditions, it actually enjoys it. Its heightened senses mean it actually relishes rotting food. So, store food in airtight containers. Cover trash bins, and
keep your basement dry. It might also be smart to
plug holes in your walls, unused electrical outlets,
and especially drains, since get this, roaches can use your plumbing
to climb up from sewers into your bathroom sink. It might not eliminate the risk entirely, but it can't hurt, and it will certainly
make you feel better. However, we can't promise
it will keep them out of your nightmares. (dramatic music)

**Transcript**:
Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind, gazed in horror as he realized he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable. The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against 
invincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage 
for an epic series of adventures that would come to be known 
as the Labors of Hercules. The first labor was 
to slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies 
at a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive. The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow. Hercules tracked it for a year, finally trapping it in the northern land 
of Hyperborea. The animal turned out to be sacred 
to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Hercules swore to return it. When Eurystheus saw the hind, 
he demanded to keep it instead, but as soon as Hercules let go,
the animal ran to its mistress. Thus, Hercules completed his task 
without breaking his promise. The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar, which had ravaged many fields. Advised by the wise centaur Chiron, Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow. For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers. The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle had not been maintained in ages. Hercules promised to clean them in one day if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock. Augeas expected the hero to fail. Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches, rerouting two nearby rivers to flow 
through the stables until they were spotless. Next came three more beastly foes, each requiring 
a clever strategy to defeat. The carnivorous Stymphalian birds 
nested in an impenetrable swamp, but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air, at which point he shot them down. No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage, but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick. And the mad King Diomedes, who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests, got a taste of his own medicine when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables. The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths. But the ninth labor involved someone 
more dangerous than any beast, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Hercules was to retrieve the belt given
to her by her father Ares, the god of war. He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira
prepared for battle, but the queen was so impressed 
with the hero and his exploits that she gave the belt willingly. For his tenth labor, Hercules had to steal a herd 
of magical red cattle from Geryon, a giant with three heads and three bodies. On his way, Hercules was so annoyed 
by the Libyan desert heat that he shot an arrow at the Sun. The sun god Helios admired 
the hero’s strength and lent his chariot for the journey 
to the island of Erytheia. There, Hercules fought off 
Geryon’s herdsman and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself. That should have been the end. But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted: the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it, and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment. And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task, obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs. Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location. Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas
holding up the heavens. Hercules offered to take his place 
if Atlas would retrieve the apples. Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then
tricked him into trading places again, escaping with apples in hand. The twelfth and final task 
was to bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hound 
guarding the underworld. Helped by Hermes and Athena, 
Hercules descended and met Hades himself. The lord of the dead allowed Hercules 
to take the beast if he could do it without weapons, which he achieved by grabbing 
all three of its heads at once. When he presented the hound 
to a horrified Eurystheus, the king finally declared 
the hero’s service complete. After 12 years of toil, Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths 
of his family and earned a place in the divine pantheon. But his victory held 
an even deeper importance. In overcoming the chaotic 
and monstrous forces of the world, the hero swept away what remained 
of the Titans’ primordial order, reshaping it into one 
where humanity could thrive. Through his labors, Hercules tamed the world’s madness 
by atoning for his own.

Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind, gazed in horror as he realized he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable. The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against 
invincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage

to slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies 
at a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast, 
Hercules next had to catch one, alive. The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer 
so fast it could outrun an arrow. Hercules tracked it for a year, finally trapping it in the northern land 
of Hyperborea. The animal turned out to be sacred 
to Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Hercules swore to return it. When Eurystheus saw the hind, 
he demanded to keep it instead, but as soon as Hercules let go,
the animal ran to its mistress. Thus, Hercules completed his task 
without breaking his promise. The fourth mission was to capture 
the Erymanthian boar, which had ravaged many fields. Advised by the wise centaur Chiron, Hercules trapped it 
by chasing it into thick snow. For the fifth task, there were no animals,
just their leftovers. The stables where King Augeas 
kept his hundreds of divine cattle had not been maintained in ages. Hercules promised to clean them in one day if he could keep one-tenth 
of the livestock. Augeas expected the hero to fail. Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches, rerouting two nearby rivers to flow 
through the stables until they were spotless. Next came three more beastly foes, each requiring 
a clever strategy to defeat. The carnivorous Stymphalian birds 
nested in an impenetrable swamp, but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle 
to frighten them into the air, at which point he shot them down. No mortal could stand before 
the Cretan bull’s mad rampage, but a chokehold 
from behind did the trick. And the mad King Diomedes, who had trained his horses 
to devour his guests, got a taste of his own medicine when Hercules wrestled him 
into his own stables. The ensuing feast calmed the beasts 
enough for Hercules to bind their mouths. But the ninth labor involved someone 
more dangerous than any beast, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Hercules was to retrieve the belt given
to her by her father Ares, the god of war. He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira
prepared for battle, but the queen was so impressed 
with the hero and his exploits that she gave the belt willingly. For his tenth labor, Hercules had to steal a herd 
of magical red cattle from Geryon, a giant with three heads and three bodies. On his way, Hercules was so annoyed 
by the Libyan desert heat that he shot an arrow at the Sun. The sun god Helios admired 
the hero’s strength and lent his chariot for the journey 
to the island of Erytheia. There, Hercules fought off 
Geryon’s herdsman and his two-headed dog, 
before killing the giant himself. That should have been the end. But Eurystheus announced 
that two labors hadn’t counted: the Hydra, because Iolaus 
had helped Hercules kill it, and the stables, 
because he’d accepted payment. And so, the hero set 
about his eleventh task, obtaining golden apples from 
the garden of the Hesperides nymphs. Hercules began by catching 
the Old Man of the Sea and holding the shape-shifting water-god
until he revealed the garden’s location. Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas
holding up the heavens. Hercules offered to take his place 
if Atlas would retrieve the apples. Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then
tricked him into trading places again, escaping with apples in hand. The twelfth and final task 
was to bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hound 
guarding the underworld. Helped by Hermes and Athena, 
Hercules descended and met Hades himself. The lord of the dead allowed Hercules 
to take the beast if he could do it without weapons, which he achieved by grabbing 
all three of its heads at once. When he presented the hound 
to a horrified Eurystheus, the king finally declared 
the hero’s service complete. After 12 years of toil, Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths 
of his family and earned a place in the divine pantheon. But his victory held 
an even deeper importance. In overcoming the chaotic 
and monstrous forces of the world, the hero swept away what remained 
of the Titans’ primordial order, reshaping it into one 
where humanity could thrive. Through his labors, Hercules tamed the world’s madness 
by atoning for his own.

**Transcript**:
Hercules, son of Zeus 
and champion of humankind, gazed in horror as he realized he had just committed 
the most unspeakable crime imaginable. The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules 
for being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him 
with a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out 
the Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay
with his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, 
a favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules 
with ten impossible tasks that pitted him against 
invincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage 
for an epic series of adventures that would come to be known 
as the Labors of Hercules. The first labor was 
to slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women 
and devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered 
the lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough 
to skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested 
using one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns 
wearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much 
that he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies 
at a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,
a giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,
two more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought 
to cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains 
became the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast,

**Transcript**:
The discovery of an alien monolith 
on planet RH-1729 has scientists across the world 
racing to unlock its mysteries. Your engineering team has developed 
an elegant probe to study it. The probe is a collection 
of 27 cube modules capable of running all the scientific 
tests necessary to analyze the monolith. The modules can self-assemble 
into a large 3x3x3 cube, with each individual module
placed anywhere in the cube, and at any orientation. It can also break itself apart 
and reassemble into any other orientation. Now comes your job. The probe will need a special 
protective coating for each of the extreme
environments it passes through. The red coating will seal it against 
the cold of deep space, the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729, and the green coating will shield it 
from the alien planet’s electric storms. You can apply the coatings to each of
the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules in any way you like, but each face can only 
take a single color coating. You need to figure out how you 
can apply the colors so the cubes can re-assemble themselves
to show only red, then purple, then green. How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes so the probe will be able 
to make the trip? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. You can start by painting the outside 
of the complete cube red, since you’ll need that regardless. Then you can break it into 27 pieces, 
and look at what you have. There are 8 corner cubes, 
which each have three red faces, 12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces, 6 face cubes, which have 1 red face, and a single center cube, 
which has no red faces. You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red 
at this point, so you’ll need the same number of faces 
for the green and purple cubes, too. When you’re done, 
you’ll have painted 54 faces red, 54 faces green, and 54 faces purple. That’s 162 faces, which is precisely 
how many the cubes have in total. So there’s no margin for waste. If there’s any way to do this,
it’ll probably be highly symmetrical. Maybe you can use that to help you. You look at the center cube. You’d better paint it half green 
and half purple, so you can use it as a corner 
for each of those cubes, and not waste a single face. There’ll need to be center cubes
with no green and no purple too. So you take 2 corner cubes 
from the red cube and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple, and the 3 blank faces of the other green. Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes 
that each have 1 face painted red. That leaves 5 empty faces on each. You can split them in half. In the first group, 
you paint 3 faces green and 2 faces purple; In the second group, 
paint 3 faces purple and 2 green. Counting on symmetry, you replicate these piles again
with the colors rearranged. That gives you 6 with 1 green face, 6 with 1 red face, and 6 with 1 purple face. Counting up 
what you’ve completely painted, you see 8 corner cubes in each color, 6 edge cubes in each color, 6 face cubes in each color, and 1 center cube. That means you just need 6 more edge cubes
in green and purple. And there are exactly 6 cubes left,
each with 4 empty faces. You paint 2 faces of each green 
and 2 faces of each purple. And now you have a cube that’s perfectly 
painted to make an incredible trip. It rearranges itself 
to be red in deep space, purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere, and green when it flies through 
the electric storms. As it reaches the monolith, you realize you’ve achieved 
something humans have dreamt of for eons: alien contact.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

an elegant probe to study it. The probe is a collection 
of 27 cube modules capable of running all the scientific 
tests necessary to analyze the monolith. The modules can self-assemble 
into a large 3x3x3 cube, with each individual module
placed anywhere in the cube, and at any orientation. It can also break itself apart 
and reassemble into any other orientation. Now comes your job. The probe will need a special 
protective coating for each of the extreme
environments it passes through. The red coating will seal it against 
the cold of deep space, the purple coating will protect it 
from the intense heat as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729, and the green coating will shield it 
from the alien planet’s electric storms. You can apply the coatings to each of
the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules in any way you like, but each face can only 
take a single color coating. You need to figure out how you 
can apply the colors so the cubes can re-assemble themselves
to show only red, then purple, then green. How can you apply the colored coatings 
to the 27 cubes so the probe will be able 
to make the trip? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out yourself. You can start by painting the outside 
of the complete cube red, since you’ll need that regardless. Then you can break it into 27 pieces, 
and look at what you have. There are 8 corner cubes, 
which each have three red faces, 12 edge cubes, 
which have two red faces, 6 face cubes, which have 1 red face, and a single center cube, 
which has no red faces. You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red 
at this point, so you’ll need the same number of faces 
for the green and purple cubes, too. When you’re done, 
you’ll have painted 54 faces red, 54 faces green, and 54 faces purple. That’s 162 faces, which is precisely 
how many the cubes have in total. So there’s no margin for waste. If there’s any way to do this,
it’ll probably be highly symmetrical. Maybe you can use that to help you. You look at the center cube. You’d better paint it half green 
and half purple, so you can use it as a corner 
for each of those cubes, and not waste a single face. There’ll need to be center cubes
with no green and no purple too. So you take 2 corner cubes 
from the red cube and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple, and the 3 blank faces of the other green. Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes 
that each have 1 face painted red. That leaves 5 empty faces on each. You can split them in half. In the first group, 
you paint 3 faces green and 2 faces purple; In the second group, 
paint 3 faces purple and 2 green. Counting on symmetry, you replicate these piles again
with the colors rearranged. That gives you 6 with 1 green face, 6 with 1 red face, and 6 with 1 purple face. Counting up 
what you’ve completely painted, you see 8 corner cubes in each color, 6 edge cubes in each color, 6 face cubes in each color, and 1 center cube. That means you just need 6 more edge cubes
in green and purple. And there are exactly 6 cubes left,
each with 4 empty faces. You paint 2 faces of each green 
and 2 faces of each purple. And now you have a cube that’s perfectly 
painted to make an incredible trip. It rearranges itself 
to be red in deep space, purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere, and green when it flies through 
the electric storms. As it reaches the monolith, you realize you’ve achieved 
something humans have dreamt of for eons: alien contact.

**Transcript**:
From asteroids capable 
of destroying entire species, to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae 
that could exterminate life on Earth, outer space has no shortage of forces
that could wreak havoc on our tiny planet. But there’s something in space that seems more terrifying 
than any of these – something that wipes out 
everything it comes near. Could the Earth 
be swallowed by a black hole? A black hole is an object so dense that space and time around it 
are inescapably modified, warped into an infinite sink. Nothing, not even light,
can move fast enough to escape a black hole’s 
gravitational pull once it passes a certain boundary, known as the event horizon. Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity, gobbling up everything in its path, 
and letting nothing out. To determine whether a black hole 
could swallow the Earth, we first have to figure out 
where they are. But since they don’t emit light, 
how’s that possible? Fortunately, we’re able to observe 
their effect on the space around them. When matter approaches a black hole, the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed. This emits an enormous amount of light. And for objects too far away 
to be sucked in, the massive gravitational force 
still affects their orbits. If we observe several stars orbiting
around an apparently empty point, a black hole could be leading the dance. Similarly, light that passes
close enough to an event horizon will be deflected in a phenomenon 
known as gravitational lensing. Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types. The smaller ones, 
called stellar mass black holes, have a mass up to 100 times larger 
than that of our sun. They’re formed when a massive star 
consumes all its nuclear fuel and its core collapses. We’ve observed several of these
objects as close as 3000 light-years away, and there could be up to 100 million 
small black holes just in the Milky Way galaxy. So should we be worried? Probably not. Despite their large mass, stellar black holes only have a radius 
of around 300 kilometers or less, making the chances 
of a direct hit with us miniscule. Although because 
their gravitational fields can affect a planet from a large distance, they could be dangerous 
even without a direct collision. If a typical stellar-mass black hole 
were to pass in the region of Neptune, the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified, with dire results. Still, the combination of how small 
they are and how vast the galaxy is means that stellar black holes
don’t give us much to worry about. But we still have to meet the second type: supermassive black holes. These have masses millions or billions
times greater than that of our sun and have event horizons that
could span billions of kilometers. These giants have grown 
to immense proportions by swallowing matter 
and merging with other black holes. Unlike their stellar cousins, supermassive black holes aren’t
wandering through space. Instead, they lie at the center 
of galaxies, including our own. Our solar system is in a stable orbit 
around a supermassive black hole that resides 
at the center of the Milky Way, at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years. But that could change. If our galaxy collides with another, the Earth could be thrown towards 
the galactic center, close enough 
to the supermassive black hole to be eventually swallowed up. In fact, a collision 
with the Andromeda Galaxy is predicted to happen 
4 billion years from now, which may not be great news
for our home planet. But before we judge them too harshly, black holes aren’t simply agents 
of destruction. They played a crucial role 
in the formation of galaxies, the building blocks of our universe. Far from being shadowy characters 
in the cosmic play, black holes have fundamentally contributed in making the universe 
a bright and astonishing place.

don’t give us much to worry about. But we still have to meet the second type: supermassive black holes. These have masses millions or billions
times greater than that of our sun and have event horizons that
could span billions of kilometers. These giants have grown 
to immense proportions by swallowing matter 
and merging with other black holes. Unlike their stellar cousins, supermassive black holes aren’t
wandering through space. Instead, they lie at the center 
of galaxies, including our own. Our solar system is in a stable orbit 
around a supermassive black hole that resides 
at the center of the Milky Way, at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years. But that could change. If our galaxy collides with another, the Earth could be thrown towards 
the galactic center, close enough 
to the supermassive black hole to be eventually swallowed up. In fact, a collision 
with the Andromeda Galaxy is predicted to happen 
4 billion years from now, which may not be great news
for our home planet. But before we judge them too harshly, black holes aren’t simply agents

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
From asteroids capable 
of destroying entire species, to gamma-ray bursts and supernovae 
that could exterminate life on Earth, outer space has no shortage of forces
that could wreak havoc on our tiny planet. But there’s something in space that seems more terrifying 
than any of these – something that wipes out 
everything it comes near. Could the Earth 
be swallowed by a black hole? A black hole is an object so dense that space and time around it 
are inescapably modified, warped into an infinite sink. Nothing, not even light,
can move fast enough to escape a black hole’s 
gravitational pull once it passes a certain boundary, known as the event horizon. Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic
vacuum cleaner with infinite capacity, gobbling up everything in its path, 
and letting nothing out. To determine whether a black hole 
could swallow the Earth, we first have to figure out 
where they are. But since they don’t emit light, 
how’s that possible? Fortunately, we’re able to observe 
their effect on the space around them. When matter approaches a black hole, the immense gravitational field
accelerates it to high speed. This emits an enormous amount of light. And for objects too far away 
to be sucked in, the massive gravitational force 
still affects their orbits. If we observe several stars orbiting
around an apparently empty point, a black hole could be leading the dance. Similarly, light that passes
close enough to an event horizon will be deflected in a phenomenon 
known as gravitational lensing. Most of the black holes that we’ve found 
can be thought of as two main types. The smaller ones, 
called stellar mass black holes, have a mass up to 100 times larger 
than that of our sun. They’re formed when a massive star 
consumes all its nuclear fuel and its core collapses. We’ve observed several of these
objects as close as 3000 light-years away, and there could be up to 100 million 
small black holes just in the Milky Way galaxy. So should we be worried? Probably not. Despite their large mass, stellar black holes only have a radius 
of around 300 kilometers or less, making the chances 
of a direct hit with us miniscule. Although because 
their gravitational fields can affect a planet from a large distance, they could be dangerous 
even without a direct collision. If a typical stellar-mass black hole 
were to pass in the region of Neptune, the orbit of the Earth 
would be considerably modified, with dire results. Still, the combination of how small 
they are and how vast the galaxy is means that stellar black holes
don’t give us much to worry about. But we still have to meet the second type: supermassive black holes. These have masses millions or billions

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. I am a descendent of giants. With a grandfather, dad, two uncles, and an
aunt all towering over 6 feet tall. We are the people you don’t want to stand
behind at a Bon Jovi concert, but we’re also the people who can get that thing off
the top shelf for you. At 6’3”, I turned out to be the short
one in the family. Now that I have a son myself, I’m wondering
if he’s going to be tall too. Is height only written in our genes or is
there something else that determines how tall These days, the average American woman is
about five foot four, while the average Joe American male is about five foot nine. But… human height has had its ups and downs
over the centuries. Three million years ago, our ancestor Australopithecus
only stood about four feet tall. One-and-a-half million years later , Homo
erectus, the first early human to use complex tools, reached up to five foot seven. And by the Stone Age, men of the Gravettian
hunter-gatherer culture in Europe stood at an average of 6 feet. Most of the historical data we have is for
male height, because… reasons. Then agriculture happened. When Europeans switched to a lower-protein,
higher-grain diet, men gradually lost 8 inches in height, on average. And they stayed that way for thousands of
years. By the time the 18th century rolled around,
the average European man was only five foot five inches tall. But when those Europeans emigrated to America,
their kids grew up to be five foot eight inches tall on average. A huge jump in just a generation. During the Industrial Revolution heights took
a dip due to urban crowding and disease, but soon after, the human height boom continued
and continues today. Every decade for the past couple centuries
Europeans have grown an average of about half an inch. Today, Dutch men are the tallest people in
the world, with an average height of just over 6 feet - back to where those Gravettians
started 8 millennia ago. These fluctuations of height, sometimes within
a single generation, show that our environment determines a big part of how tall we are. But people in different regions, and different
families, show us that height has genetic causes too. So which has a bigger role, nature? Or nurture? In the early 19th century, scientists first
noticed a correlation between people’s heights and their wealth – people from poor backgrounds
tended to be shorter than people who were more well-off. Instead of asking whether someone’s upbringing
might influence their height, many scholars at the time decided tallness was a physical
mark of “superior” humans. Francis Galton - who would later become infamous
for popularizing eugenics - was the first scientist to conduct a large-scale, systematic
study of height. He precisely measured the height of thousands
of people as part of a sort of scientific side show. But Galton’s results were confusing. Parents’ heights often didn’t predict
the heights of their kids. The heights of siblings on the other hand,
were much closer. This inspired scientists to look at height
in twins. Studying twins can teach us a ton about how
genes and environments influence human attributes. Fraternal twins can be as different genetically
as any other pair of siblings, with the added advantage of being exactly the same age. Identical twins are genetically, well, identical. So we can see how much genetic carbon copies
end up differing. And twins separated at birth offer a window
into what happens when genetically identical individuals grow up in very different environments. Turns out that twins, especially identical
twins, tend to be close in height - but not exactly the same. Twin studies, like history, show us genes
can only be part of the story when it comes to height. So how big a part? In 2007, scientists compared height and DNA
between more than 11,000 pairs of siblings and found that, across humans, 86% of height’s
variation can be explained by genetics. As traits go, this is very high; for comparison,
genetics only explains about 26% of left-handedness. So we should be able to predict a person’s
height from his or her DNA right? Not so fast. We know genes make a huge difference, just
not which genes. So far, scientists have identified about 800
genes that influence height, but many of them only make a tiny contribution. Take HGMA2, one of the first genes linked
to height. Having one copy of the “tall” version
only “lifts” a person about an eighth of an inch, so even if you inherit a copy
from both of your parents, that still only gains you a quarter of an inch at most. Altogether, the 800 height genes we know of
can only explain 27% of how height varies between people. There’s clearly lots of genetic influence
we don’t understand. Maybe the effects of some genes add up in
unexpected ways - genes may interact in combinations, where four and four makes sixteen, not eight. If we could just study the DNA of all the
7 billion people on Earth, maybe we would find all the genes that affect height. Or maybe we’d find that scientists have
overestimated the contribution of genetics? Because our environment, defined by health
and diet, certainly has a hand in shaping our height. South Koreans today are more than an inch
taller than North Koreans, despite minimal genetic differences. Clearly, one’s diet during childhood, is
a crucial in determining adult height. That’s why humans shrank with the switch
to agriculture and again during the Industrial Revolution. Today, most scientists agree that nature and
nurture combine to shape our height. Some even propose calling height an “omnigenic”
trait - one that nearly all our genes influence in some way. For now, the only surefire way to know how
tall you’ll end up… is just to wait and see. Stay curious!

study of height. He precisely measured the height of thousands
of people as part of a sort of scientific side show. But Galton’s results were confusing. Parents’ heights often didn’t predict
the heights of their kids. The heights of siblings on the other hand,
were much closer. This inspired scientists to look at height
in twins. Studying twins can teach us a ton about how
genes and environments influence human attributes. Fraternal twins can be as different genetically
as any other pair of siblings, with the added advantage of being exactly the same age. Identical twins are genetically, well, identical. So we can see how much genetic carbon copies
end up differing. And twins separated at birth offer a window
into what happens when genetically identical individuals grow up in very different environments. Turns out that twins, especially identical
twins, tend to be close in height - but not exactly the same. Twin studies, like history, show us genes
can only be part of the story when it comes to height. So how big a part? In 2007, scientists compared height and DNA
between more than 11,000 pairs of siblings and found that, across humans, 86% of height’s
variation can be explained by genetics. As traits go, this is very high; for comparison,
genetics only explains about 26% of left-handedness. So we should be able to predict a person’s
height from his or her DNA right? Not so fast. We know genes make a huge difference, just
not which genes. So far, scientists have identified about 800
genes that influence height, but many of them only make a tiny contribution. Take HGMA2, one of the first genes linked
to height. Having one copy of the “tall” version
only “lifts” a person about an eighth of an inch, so even if you inherit a copy
from both of your parents, that still only gains you a quarter of an inch at most. Altogether, the 800 height genes we know of
can only explain 27% of how height varies between people. There’s clearly lots of genetic influence
we don’t understand. Maybe the effects of some genes add up in
unexpected ways - genes may interact in combinations, where four and four makes sixteen, not eight. If we could just study the DNA of all the
7 billion people on Earth, maybe we would find all the genes that affect height. Or maybe we’d find that scientists have
overestimated the contribution of genetics? Because our environment, defined by health
and diet, certainly has a hand in shaping our height. South Koreans today are more than an inch
taller than North Koreans, despite minimal genetic differences. Clearly, one’s diet during childhood, is
a crucial in determining adult height. That’s why humans shrank with the switch
to agriculture and again during the Industrial Revolution. Today, most scientists agree that nature and
nurture combine to shape our height. Some even propose calling height an “omnigenic”
trait - one that nearly all our genes influence in some way. For now, the only surefire way to know how
tall you’ll end up… is just to wait and see. Stay curious!

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. I am a descendent of giants. With a grandfather, dad, two uncles, and an
aunt all towering over 6 feet tall. We are the people you don’t want to stand
behind at a Bon Jovi concert, but we’re also the people who can get that thing off
the top shelf for you. At 6’3”, I turned out to be the short
one in the family. Now that I have a son myself, I’m wondering
if he’s going to be tall too. Is height only written in our genes or is
there something else that determines how tall These days, the average American woman is
about five foot four, while the average Joe American male is about five foot nine. But… human height has had its ups and downs
over the centuries. Three million years ago, our ancestor Australopithecus
only stood about four feet tall. One-and-a-half million years later , Homo
erectus, the first early human to use complex tools, reached up to five foot seven. And by the Stone Age, men of the Gravettian
hunter-gatherer culture in Europe stood at an average of 6 feet. Most of the historical data we have is for
male height, because… reasons. Then agriculture happened. When Europeans switched to a lower-protein,
higher-grain diet, men gradually lost 8 inches in height, on average. And they stayed that way for thousands of
years. By the time the 18th century rolled around,
the average European man was only five foot five inches tall. But when those Europeans emigrated to America,
their kids grew up to be five foot eight inches tall on average. A huge jump in just a generation. During the Industrial Revolution heights took
a dip due to urban crowding and disease, but soon after, the human height boom continued
and continues today. Every decade for the past couple centuries
Europeans have grown an average of about half an inch. Today, Dutch men are the tallest people in
the world, with an average height of just over 6 feet - back to where those Gravettians
started 8 millennia ago. These fluctuations of height, sometimes within
a single generation, show that our environment determines a big part of how tall we are. But people in different regions, and different
families, show us that height has genetic causes too. So which has a bigger role, nature? Or nurture? In the early 19th century, scientists first
noticed a correlation between people’s heights and their wealth – people from poor backgrounds
tended to be shorter than people who were more well-off. Instead of asking whether someone’s upbringing
might influence their height, many scholars at the time decided tallness was a physical
mark of “superior” humans. Francis Galton - who would later become infamous
for popularizing eugenics - was the first scientist to conduct a large-scale, systematic
study of height. He precisely measured the height of thousands
of people as part of a sort of scientific side show. But Galton’s results were confusing. Parents’ heights often didn’t predict
the heights of their kids. The heights of siblings on the other hand,

**Transcript**:
- [Narrator] If you doubled in size, your weight would be eight times greater. That's the trouble with growing tall. Gravity's pull is keeping us all down, but there are a few earthly giants that have fought gravity and won. (gentle instrumental music) The key to growing tall is
how you use your energy. That's why the tallest trees
outrank any animal on Earth, because trees spend all
their energy on one thing; growing taller than
their fellow neighbors. And there are two trees
that are the best growers of them all: giant redwoods
and mountain ashes. Redwoods are renowned as the
tallest lifeforms on Earth, but some experts think that
mountain ashes could grow even taller if humans would
stop cutting them down. In fact, the tallest mountain ash was just one meter shorter than
the tallest redwood. Unlike plants, animals spend
energy on all sorts of tasks, like eating, walking, and staying warm, so they can't grow as tall. But it doesn't mean they're small, either. If you measured this African elephant from shoulder to ground, it would actually be
taller than a giraffe, but thanks to their long, strong necks, giraffes are the tallest animals alive. And if we look at animals
throughout Earth's history, dinosaurs eclipsed them all. These towering sauropods were
the biggest of the bunch. In fact, the top ten lists of tallest animals in history? All dinosaurs. But what if we looked at
the longest lifeforms, too? If you balance the longest
saltwater crocodile on its nose, it would tie the giraffe. And if we ignore legs it gets even better. Tip-to-tail, the green
anaconda nearly doubles the height of the tallest giraffe. But these land-dwellers have
nothing on animals of the deep. Supported by water, sea life
can practically ignore gravity, which means they can grow much larger. Take the blue whale, for example. It's the most massive animal of all time. For example, the entire cast of Broadway's The Lion King can fit on its tongue. But it should be careful
not to get tangled up in the tentacles of a
lion's mane jellyfish, which makes the giant squid
look small by comparison. Now, the biggest fish
alive is the whale shark, and if we look into the
past things get even bigger. So where do humans fit into all this? Somewhere near the top, actually. Humans are bigger than
87.6% of mammals on Earth and the average Dutchman
is the tallest of them all. So there's no reason to
ever feel small again, especially if you're from the Netherlands. (gentle instrumental music) Fun fact, the longest
life-form of all time isn't a plant or animal at all. It's a honey fungus and
the biggest one goes on for 3.8 kilometers underneath
a forest in Oregon.

**Transcript**:
“Here lies Arthur, 
king who was, and king who will be.” So reads the inscription 
on King Arthur’s gravestone in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. Writing in the 15th century, Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic
this inscription would turn out to be. King Arthur has risen again 
and again in our collective imagination, along with his retinue of knights, Guinevere, the Round Table, Camelot, and of course, Excalibur. But where do these stories come from,
and is there any truth to them? King Arthur as we know him 
is a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots 
in Celtic poetry from an earlier time: the Saxon invasions of Britain. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from 
what’s now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the vulnerability 
of the abandoned territory. The inhabitants of Britain fought 
fiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil. There are hardly any written records 
from this time, so it’s difficult to reconstruct 
an accurate history. However, surviving poetry from the era
gives us some clues. One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur, though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it. It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur, was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur. That’s not much to go on, but whoever this Arthur was, he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors. Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear. Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later. In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
was a lowly cleric with grand ambitions. Using Celtic and Latin sources, he spent years creating 
a lengthy chronicle titled, "The History 
of the Kings of Britain." The centerpiece 
of this tome was King Arthur. History is a generous term 
for Geoffrey’s account. Writing six hundred years after 
the Saxon invasions, he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records. A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places. But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery. Geoffrey blended them all: A magical sword called Caledfwlch and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material, so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus, the Latin translation of Caledfwlch. Geoffrey even added a wise
counselor named Merlin, based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, 
to Arthur’s story. If Arthur did live, he would likely 
have been a military leader, but a castle-bound king better fit
Geoffrey’s regal history. Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention 
he’d hoped for, and was soon translated from Latin
into French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE. Wace added another centerpiece of
Arthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword, castle, and wizard: the Round Table. He wrote that Arthur 
had the table constructed so that all guests in his court 
would be equally placed, and none could boast that he had 
the highest position at the table. After reading Wace’s translation, 
another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, wrote a series of romances 
that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur. In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem, his story has transformed over 
and over to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences. And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today. Whether or not the man ever lived, loved, reigned, or adventured, it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.

that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,
he also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers
on magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations 
of the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur. In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem, his story has transformed over 
and over to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences. And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today. Whether or not the man ever lived, loved, reigned, or adventured, it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.

**Transcript**:
“Here lies Arthur, 
king who was, and king who will be.” So reads the inscription 
on King Arthur’s gravestone in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. Writing in the 15th century, Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic
this inscription would turn out to be. King Arthur has risen again 
and again in our collective imagination, along with his retinue of knights, Guinevere, the Round Table, Camelot, and of course, Excalibur. But where do these stories come from,
and is there any truth to them? King Arthur as we know him 
is a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots 
in Celtic poetry from an earlier time: the Saxon invasions of Britain. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from 
what’s now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the vulnerability 
of the abandoned territory. The inhabitants of Britain fought 
fiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil. There are hardly any written records 
from this time, so it’s difficult to reconstruct 
an accurate history. However, surviving poetry from the era
gives us some clues. One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains
the very first reference to Arthur, though Arthur himself 
doesn’t actually appear in it. It says a different warrior,
named Gwawrddur, was skilled at slaying his enemies, 
but was no Arthur. That’s not much to go on, but whoever this Arthur was, he must’ve been 
the gold standard of warriors. Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived 
at all is, unfortunately, less clear. Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught 
the attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later. In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth 
was a lowly cleric with grand ambitions. Using Celtic and Latin sources, he spent years creating 
a lengthy chronicle titled, "The History 
of the Kings of Britain." The centerpiece 
of this tome was King Arthur. History is a generous term 
for Geoffrey’s account. Writing six hundred years after 
the Saxon invasions, he cobbled together fragments 
of myth and poetry to compensate for the almost 
complete lack of official records. A few of his sources contained 
mentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts 
of battles and places. But many featured mythic heroes 
fighting long odds with the help of magical swords 
and sorcery. Geoffrey blended them all: A magical sword called Caledfwlch and a Roman fortress called Caerleon 
appeared in his source material, so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon
and wielded Caliburnus, the Latin translation of Caledfwlch. Geoffrey even added a wise
counselor named Merlin, based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, 
to Arthur’s story. If Arthur did live, he would likely 
have been a military leader, but a castle-bound king better fit
Geoffrey’s regal history. Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention 
he’d hoped for, and was soon translated from Latin
into French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE. Wace added another centerpiece of
Arthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword, castle, and wizard: the Round Table. He wrote that Arthur 
had the table constructed so that all guests in his court 
would be equally placed, and none could boast that he had 
the highest position at the table. After reading Wace’s translation, 
another French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, wrote a series of romances 
that catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights 
like Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance 
in with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,

of the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic 
from the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French 
and other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,
Caerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus 
was rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized 
these stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts 
of King Arthur. In the thousand years since Arthur 
first appeared in a Celtic poem, his story has transformed over 
and over to reflect the concerns of his chroniclers
and their audiences. And we’re still rewriting 
and adapting the legend today. Whether or not the man ever lived, loved, reigned, or adventured, it’s undeniable that the character 
has achieved immortality.

**Transcript**:
You probably know how this symbol is supposed
to make you feel. And this one. This one too, even if you’re not sure exactly
what it means. But what about this? This symbol — The Jolly Roger — was once
one of the most feared symbols in the world. It represented death, pirates, and poison. But today, it’s associated more with treasure, blockbuster
movies, or Halloween than actual danger. We are surrounded by icons that warn us: what
to stay away from, what not to do, what to be afraid of. But how do you design a symbol in a way that
will last across generations and languages? It turns out that is an incredibly hard thing
to do. Back in the early 20th century, there was
an urgent need for a new kind of warning symbol. At the time, there was no universal standard
for communicating the presence of dangerous biological materials. Laboratories at the US Army used an inverted
blue triangle. Those at the Navy used a pink rectangle. The Universal Postal Convention used a white
staff-and-snake on a violet background. There was no consistency in the visual language
used to communicate risk. That was dangerous, and could lead to accidental
infections. So in 1966, a group of engineers and designers
at Dow Chemical set out to create the best possible icon for biohazardous materials. They laid out six design criteria. First, it needed to be visually striking,
so that it would draw immediate attention. That ruled out simple shapes like those from
the Navy and Army. It also had to be unique and unambiguous,
in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes. That ruled out the snake-and-staff, which
has multiple versions and has a pretty vague meaning as a general symbol for medicine. On top of that, it had to be quickly recognizable
and easily recalled. Had to be easy to stencil. And rotationally symmetrical, in order to
appear identical from all angles. And lastly, it had to be acceptable to groups
of all backgrounds. So the Dow Chemical team designed an experiment. Charles Baldwin, an environmental health engineer
behind the experiment, said that the team “wanted something that was memorable but
meaningless … so we could educate people as to what it means." They showed a set of 24 symbols to 300 people
from 25 American cities. There were 6 newly-designed biohazard markers,
and 18 common symbols — things like Mr. Peanut, the Texaco star, the Shell Oil symbol,
the Red Cross, and a swastika. Participants were asked to guess the meaning
of each one, which was used to assign each one a “meaningfulness score.” A week later, the same participants were shown
those original 24 symbols, plus 36 more. They were asked to identify which symbols
they remembered seeing in the previous round of the study. Among the six competing biohazard designs,
this one stood out. It scored the highest in memorability, but
the lowest in meaningfulness. So it was unforgettable, but also a totally
blank slate for designers who wanted to give it meaning. And with that, it became a national standard. It’s easy to overlook how much visual communication
work these symbols are doing. They’re simple — you only need a straightedge
and a compass to recreate them. And unlike most other hazard symbols, they
don’t reference an existing physical object or idea. But they’ve remained iconic for decades,
helping people recognize serious dangers that may remain a threat for thousands of years
to come. And that raises the question: could the meaning
of those symbols stand the test of time? Few people have pondered that question quite
like Gregory Benford. He’s a physicist and science fiction author. In the 1990s, he was invited to work on the
Waste Isolation Pilot Project, or WIPP. The WIPP is a massive storage site for radioactive
waste in the southeastern plains of New Mexico, organized by the US Department of Energy. Benford was brought in to help calculate the
probability that someone or something would intrude on the site for as long as it remains
dangerous — approximately the next 10,000 years. “Well, name anything that has persisted
for 10,000 years. Any institution. There isn't any. The record is probably something like the
Catholic Church or the core of the Jewish religion, which tells us something about what
really lasts.” The meaning of a symbol can change over time. Like the Jolly Roger, which wouldn't work
for the radioactive threat at the WIPP. "If you're approaching the WIPP facility and
you see a skull and crossbones you might think, ‘Hey this is where the pirates buried their
treasure.’” So how do you indicate a long lasting danger
across any language? Since the 1970s, engineers, anthropologists,
physicists, and behavioral scientists have proposed different solutions to that problem. One strategy was to add context to the symbol. By illustrating cause and effect in a three-part
cartoon like this, designers could communicate the idea even if the symbol lost its meaning. But this kind of visual communication still
made a lot of assumptions about the user: that they would read left to right, that they
would understand causality between frames — and, of course, that the drawing itself
would last millennia of wear and tear. So other designers started to focus on creating
a warning without inscribed communication, by altering the shape of the location itself. And that yielded designs like this. Spike fields, forbidding blocks, giant pyramids:
these designs capitalized on natural instincts of fear and discomfort to keep people away. But even then, they weren’t foolproof. Designers couldn’t be sure whether they
would be perceived as terrifying or fascinating. “Conflict between these two urges: you want
people to notice it but you don't want people to go there. Those are always going to fight each other.” So without symbols, without basic illustrations,
or physical structures, how can you effectively communicate a warning? That’s where the more philosophical design
solutions come in. In 1984, the German Journal of Semiotics published
a series of solutions from various scholars. Linguist Thomas Sebeok proposed creating an
atomic priesthood, where an exclusive political group would use its own rituals and myths
to preserve information about the radioactive areas. And philosophers François Bastide and Paolo
Fabbri proposed to genetically engineer bioluminescent cats that would glow in the presence of radioactivity. By creating songs and traditions about the
danger of glowing cats, the warning could last as long as the oldest relics of civilization
we have: culture. There’s no definitive solution for warning
people far into the future. But designing clear, inclusive symbols will
continue to be a fundamental part of how we keep people safe. We will change, and so will the ways we communicate
visually. Our warning symbols will have to change along
with us.

**Transcript**:
You’re overseeing the delivery 
of crucial supplies to a rebel base deep in the heart of enemy territory. To get past Imperial customs, all
packages must follow a strict protocol: if a box is marked with 
an even number on the bottom, it must be sealed with a red top. The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport when you receive an urgent message. One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one. All the boxes are still 
on the conveyor belt. Two are facing down: 
one marked with a four, and one with a seven. The other two are facing up: one with a black top, another with a red one. You know that any violation 
of the protocol will get the entire shipment confiscated
and put your allies in grave danger. But any boxes you pull off for inspection
won’t make it onto this delivery run, depriving the rebels 
of critically needed supplies. The transport leaves in a few moments,
with or without its cargo. Which box or boxes should you 
grab off the conveyor belt? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes to see what’s on the other side of each. But in fact, only two of them matter. Let’s look at the protocol again. All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top. It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes, so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven. What about the box with a red top? Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even? As it turns out, we don’t. The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number, then it should have a red top. It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops, or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number. The requirement 
only goes in one direction. So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid. We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid, to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box. If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone. That error is so common,
we even have a name for it: affirming the consequent, or the fallacy of the converse. This fallacy wrongly assumes that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result, it must also be sufficient for it. For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition for being a habitable planet. But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability. If that still seems hard 
to wrap your head around, let’s look at 
a slightly different problem. Imagine the boxes contain groceries. You see one marked for shipment 
to a steakhouse and one to a vegetarian restaurant. Then you see two more boxes 
turned upside down: one labeled as containing meat, and another as containing onions. Which ones do you need to check? Well, it’s easy – make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant, and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat. The onions can go to either place, and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product. Why does this scenario seem easier? Formally, it’s the same problem – two possible conditions
for the top of the box, and two for the bottom. But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs, and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables, they’re not the only ones who do so. In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary, and when they’re abstracted that way, the logical connections 
become harder to see. In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through to enable the resistance 
to fight another day. And you did it by thinking 
outside the box – both sides of it.

of critically needed supplies. The transport leaves in a few moments,
with or without its cargo. Which box or boxes should you 
grab off the conveyor belt? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 It may seem like you need to inspect 
all four boxes to see what’s on the other side of each. But in fact, only two of them matter. Let’s look at the protocol again. All it says is that even-numbered boxes 
must have a red top. It doesn’t say anything 
about odd-numbered boxes, so we can just ignore 
the box marked with a seven. What about the box with a red top? Don’t we need to check 
that the number on the bottom is even? As it turns out, we don’t. The protocol says that 
if a box has an even number, then it should have a red top. It doesn’t say that only boxes 
with even numbers can have red tops, or that a box with a red top 
must have an even number. The requirement 
only goes in one direction. So we don’t need 
to check the box with the red lid. We do, however, 
need to check the one with the black lid, to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly 
placed on an even-numbered box. If you initially assumed the rules 
imply a symmetrical match between the number on the box 
and the type of lid, you’re not alone. That error is so common,
we even have a name for it: affirming the consequent, or the fallacy of the converse. This fallacy wrongly assumes that just because a certain condition 
is necessary for a given result, it must also be sufficient for it. For instance, having an atmosphere 
is a necessary condition for being a habitable planet. But this doesn’t mean that 
it’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres 
but lack other criteria for habitability. If that still seems hard 
to wrap your head around, let’s look at 
a slightly different problem. Imagine the boxes contain groceries. You see one marked for shipment 
to a steakhouse and one to a vegetarian restaurant. Then you see two more boxes 
turned upside down: one labeled as containing meat, and another as containing onions. Which ones do you need to check? Well, it’s easy – make sure the meat isn’t being shipped 
to the vegetarian restaurant, and that the box going there 
doesn’t contain meat. The onions can go to either place, and the box bound for the steakhouse 
can contain either product. Why does this scenario seem easier? Formally, it’s the same problem – two possible conditions
for the top of the box, and two for the bottom. But in this case, they’re based on 
familiar real-world needs, and we easily understand that 
while vegetarians only eat vegetables, they’re not the only ones who do so. In the original problem,
the rules seemed more arbitrary, and when they’re abstracted that way, the logical connections 
become harder to see. In your case, you’ve managed 
to get enough supplies through to enable the resistance 
to fight another day. And you did it by thinking 
outside the box – both sides of it.

You’re overseeing the delivery

packages must follow a strict protocol: if a box is marked with 
an even number on the bottom, it must be sealed with a red top. The boxes are already being loaded 
onto the transport when you receive an urgent message. One of the four boxes 
was sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one. All the boxes are still

**Transcript**:
The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang nearly fourteen billion
years ago, and has been expanding 
ever since. But what is it expanding into? That's a complicated question. Here's why: Einstein's equations of
general relativity describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected fabric for the universe. This means that what we know of
as space and time exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it. Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out into more space. But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into, what does expanding 
even mean? In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations gave us a definitive answer. His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies recede, or move away,
from the Earth. Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes. How can we interpret this? Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven. The batter rises by the same
amount in between each and every raisin. If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies, and batter as the space
between them, we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other, and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger distance than the nearby ones in the same amount of time. Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion. It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding 
unto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang. The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe, as a sparse gas --but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be? The inflationary model 
describes a brief era of incredibly rapid expansion that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe, to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies. If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation. We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality, save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state. In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes. Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them —would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics. Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse, in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible for us to encounter a neighbor universe. The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces may unify into one super-force. Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification, in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons. In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe. Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description, and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes. Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane, floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace. Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace, and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity. Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse, but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other. An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background —a soup of radiation throughout our universe,

**Transcript**:
The universe began its 
cosmic life in a big bang nearly fourteen billion
years ago, and has been expanding 
ever since. But what is it expanding into? That's a complicated question. Here's why: Einstein's equations of
general relativity describe space and time
as a kind of inter-connected fabric for the universe. This means that what we know of
as space and time exist only as part of the universe
and not beyond it. Now, when everyday objects
expand, they move out into more space. But if there is no such thing
as space to expand into, what does expanding 
even mean? In 1929 Edwin Hubble's 
astronomy observations gave us a definitive answer. His survey of the night sky
found all faraway galaxies recede, or move away,
from the Earth. Moreover, the further the galaxy, 
the faster it recedes. How can we interpret this? Consider a loaf of raisin bread
rising in the oven. The batter rises by the same
amount in between each and every raisin. If we think of raisins as a 
stand-in for galaxies, and batter as the space
between them, we can imagine that the
stretching or expansion of intergalactic space will make 
the galaxies recede from each other, and for any galaxy, its faraway
neighbors will recede a larger distance than the nearby ones in the same amount of time. Sure enough, the equations of
general relativity predict a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity 
and expansion. It's only in the dark void between
galaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding 
unto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing 
the limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything,
exists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses,
but hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory
of the Big Bang. The Big Bang predicts matter to be 
distributed evenly across the universe, as a sparse gas --but then, how 
did galaxies and stars come to be? The inflationary model 
describes a brief era of incredibly rapid expansion that relates quantum fluctuations 
in the energy of the early universe, to the formation of clumps of gas 
that eventually led to galaxies. If we accept this paradigm, it may 
also imply our universe represents one region in a greater cosmic reality 
that undergoes endless, eternal inflation. We know nothing of this 
speculative inflating reality, save for the mathematical prediction 
that its endless expansion may be driven by an unstable 
quantum energy state. In many local regions, however, 
the energy may settle by random chance into a stable state, stopping 
inflation and forming bubble universes. Each bubble universe
—ours being one of them —would be described by its own 
Big Bang and laws of physics. Our universe would be part 
of a greater multiverse, in which the fantastic rate of eternal 
inflation makes it impossible for us to encounter a neighbor universe. The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, 
hot universe, our fundamental forces may unify into one super-force. Mathematical string theories suggest 
descriptions of this unification, in addition to a fundamental structure 
for sub-atomic quarks and electrons. In these proposed models, vibrating strings 
are the building blocks of the universe. Competing models for strings have now 
been consolidated into a unified description, and suggest these structures may interact 
with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes. Our universe may be contained 
within one such brane, floating in an unknown higher dimensional 
place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace. Other branes—containing other types of 
universes—may co-exist in hyperspace, and neighboring branes may even share 
certain fundamental forces like gravity. Both eternal inflation and branes 
describe a multiverse, but while universes in eternal inflation are 
isolated, brane universes could bump into each other. An echo of such a collision may appear 
in the cosmic microwave background —a soup of radiation throughout our universe, 
that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era. So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo. Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description, or be replaced by something else. As it stands now, they’re speculative

that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era. So far, though, we’ve found 
no such cosmic echo. Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses 
may eventually coalesce into a common description, or be replaced by something else. As it stands now, they’re speculative 
explorations of mathematical models. While these models are inspired and 
guided by many scientific experiments, there are very few objective experiments 
to directly test them, yet. Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along, scientists will likely be left to argue about 
the elegance of their competing models… and continue to dream about what, 
if anything, lies beyond our universe.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If a so-called “echo” interference effect is observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background, this would strongly support which speculative theory?
Options: A. The Big Bang, B. Cosmic inflation, C. Eternal inflation, D. Brane cosmology

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 15, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 6
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You spend weeks studying 
for an important test. On the big day, you wait nervously
as your teacher hands it out. You’re working your way through, 
when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’ You know you’ve seen it before, 
but your mind goes blank. What just happened? The answer lies in 
the complex relationship between stress and memory. There are many types 
and degrees of stress and different kinds of memory, but we’re going to focus on 
how short-term stress impacts your memory for facts. To start, it helps to understand 
how this kind of memory works. Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through
a process with three main steps. First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter
a new piece of information. Each sensory experience activates 
a unique set of brain areas. In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated 
by the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences 
associated with strong emotions. The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening 
the synaptic connections stimulated during 
the original sensory experience. Once a memory has been encoded, it can be remembered, 
or retrieved, later. Memories are stored all over the brain, and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex 
that signals for their retrieval. So how does stress 
affect each of these stages? In the first two stages, moderate stress can actually 
help experiences enter your memory. Your brain responds to stressful stimuli by releasing hormones 
known as corticosteroids, which activate a process 
of threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala. The amygdala prompts your hippocampus to consolidate the stress-inducing 
experience into a memory. Meanwhile, the flood 
of corticosteroids from stress stimulates your hippocampus, also prompting memory consolidation. But even though some stress 
can be helpful, extreme and chronic stress 
can have the opposite effect. Researchers have tested this by injecting
rats directly with stress hormones. As they gradually increased 
the dose of corticosteroids, the rats’ performance on
memory tests increased at first, but dropped off at higher doses. In humans, we see a similar 
positive effect with moderate stress. But that only appears when 
the stress is related to the memory task— so while time pressure might 
help you memorize a list, having a friend scare you will not. And the weeks, months, or even years of sustained corticosteroids 
that result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability 
to form new memories. It would be nice if some stress 
also helped us remember facts, but unfortunately, the opposite is true. The act of remembering relies 
on the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought, 
attention, and reasoning. When corticosteroids 
stimulate the amygdala, the amygdala inhibits, 
or lessens the activity of, the prefrontal cortex. The reason for this inhibition
is so the fight/flight/freeze response can overrule slower, more reasoned 
thought in a dangerous situation. But that can also have 
the unfortunate effect of making your mind 
go blank during a test. And then the act of trying to remember
can itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle 
of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering. So what can you do to turn stress 
to your advantage and stay calm and collected 
when it matters the most? First, if you know a stressful
situation like a test is coming, try preparing in conditions similar 
to the stressful environment. Novelty can be a stressor. Completing practice questions 
under time pressure, or seated at a desk 
rather than on a couch, can make your stress response
to these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself. Exercise is another useful tool. Increasing your heart 
and breathing rate is linked to chemical changes 
in your brain that help reduce anxiety 
and increase your sense of well-being. Regular exercise is also widely 
thought to improve sleeping patterns, which comes in handy 
the night before a test. And on the actual test day, try taking deep breaths to counteract 
your body’s flight/fight/freeze response. Deep breathing exercises have shown
measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from
third graders to nursing students. So the next time you find your mind 
going blank at a critical moment, take a few deep breaths 
until you remember ataraxia: a state of calmness, free from anxiety.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
You spend weeks studying 
for an important test. On the big day, you wait nervously
as your teacher hands it out. You’re working your way through, 
when you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’ You know you’ve seen it before, 
but your mind goes blank. What just happened? The answer lies in 
the complex relationship between stress and memory. There are many types 
and degrees of stress and different kinds of memory, but we’re going to focus on 
how short-term stress impacts your memory for facts. To start, it helps to understand 
how this kind of memory works. Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through
a process with three main steps. First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter
a new piece of information. Each sensory experience activates 
a unique set of brain areas. In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated 
by the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences 
associated with strong emotions. The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening 
the synaptic connections stimulated during 
the original sensory experience. Once a memory has been encoded, it can be remembered, 
or retrieved, later. Memories are stored all over the brain, and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex 
that signals for their retrieval. So how does stress 
affect each of these stages? In the first two stages, moderate stress can actually 
help experiences enter your memory. Your brain responds to stressful stimuli by releasing hormones 
known as corticosteroids, which activate a process 
of threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala. The amygdala prompts your hippocampus to consolidate the stress-inducing 
experience into a memory. Meanwhile, the flood 
of corticosteroids from stress stimulates your hippocampus, also prompting memory consolidation. But even though some stress 
can be helpful, extreme and chronic stress 
can have the opposite effect. Researchers have tested this by injecting
rats directly with stress hormones. As they gradually increased 
the dose of corticosteroids, the rats’ performance on
memory tests increased at first, but dropped off at higher doses. In humans, we see a similar 
positive effect with moderate stress. But that only appears when 
the stress is related to the memory task— so while time pressure might 
help you memorize a list, having a friend scare you will not. And the weeks, months, or even years of sustained corticosteroids 
that result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability 
to form new memories. It would be nice if some stress 
also helped us remember facts, but unfortunately, the opposite is true. The act of remembering relies 
on the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought, 
attention, and reasoning. When corticosteroids 
stimulate the amygdala, the amygdala inhibits, 
or lessens the activity of, the prefrontal cortex. The reason for this inhibition
is so the fight/flight/freeze response can overrule slower, more reasoned 
thought in a dangerous situation. But that can also have 
the unfortunate effect of making your mind 
go blank during a test. And then the act of trying to remember
can itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle 
of more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering. So what can you do to turn stress 
to your advantage and stay calm and collected 
when it matters the most? First, if you know a stressful
situation like a test is coming, try preparing in conditions similar 
to the stressful environment. Novelty can be a stressor. Completing practice questions 
under time pressure, or seated at a desk 
rather than on a couch, can make your stress response
to these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself. Exercise is another useful tool. Increasing your heart 
and breathing rate is linked to chemical changes 
in your brain that help reduce anxiety 
and increase your sense of well-being. Regular exercise is also widely 
thought to improve sleeping patterns, which comes in handy 
the night before a test. And on the actual test day, try taking deep breaths to counteract 
your body’s flight/fight/freeze response. Deep breathing exercises have shown
measurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from
third graders to nursing students. So the next time you find your mind 
going blank at a critical moment, take a few deep breaths 
until you remember ataraxia: a state of calmness, free from anxiety.

**Transcript**:
One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco
for a vacation with his family, Colombian journalist Gabriel García 
Márquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the
family’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book 
had suddenly come to him: “Many years later, 
as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember 
that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom 
into One Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on 
to bring Latin American literature to the forefront 
of the global imagination, earning García Márquez 
the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude 
so remarkable? The novel chronicles the fortunes
and misfortunes of the Buendía family 
over seven generations. With its lush, detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is not an easy book to read. But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment 
of intense romances, civil war, political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters 
named Aureliano than you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is one of the most famous examples of a literary genre 
known as magical realism. Here, supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic 
and matter-of-fact tone, while the real events of human life 
and history reveal themselves 
to be full of fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the
fictional village of Macondo intertwine seamlessly with events taking
place in the real country of Colombia. The settlement begins 
in a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed 
to the outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, 
characters grow old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated 
in the next generation. When the American fruit company 
comes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is
always followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves forward 
through subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many characters have similar names 
and features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often repeat. Strange prophecies 
and visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes 
and firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens 
a plantation near the village and ends up massacring thousands 
of striking workers, mirroring the real-life 
‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this produces a sense 
of history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape. Beneath the magic is a story 
about the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history 
from colonial times onward. This is a history that 
the author experienced firsthand. Gabriel García Márquez grew up
in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its Conservative 
and Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and covered the 1958 Venezuelan 
coup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest influences 
were his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a
decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against
Colombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez 
to a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’
omnipresent superstition became the foundation 
of One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca 
where the author spent his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez 
found a unique way to capture the unique history 
of Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality 
of living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive 
the tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism,
the novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected 
on Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the
possibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able
to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned 
to one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever,
a second chance on earth."

**Transcript**:
One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco
for a vacation with his family, Colombian journalist Gabriel García 
Márquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the
family’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book 
had suddenly come to him: “Many years later, 
as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember 
that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom 
into One Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on 
to bring Latin American literature to the forefront 
of the global imagination, earning García Márquez 
the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude 
so remarkable? The novel chronicles the fortunes
and misfortunes of the Buendía family 
over seven generations. With its lush, detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is not an easy book to read. But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment 
of intense romances, civil war, political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters 
named Aureliano than you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude 
is one of the most famous examples of a literary genre 
known as magical realism. Here, supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic 
and matter-of-fact tone, while the real events of human life 
and history reveal themselves 
to be full of fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the
fictional village of Macondo intertwine seamlessly with events taking
place in the real country of Colombia. The settlement begins 
in a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed 
to the outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, 
characters grow old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated 
in the next generation. When the American fruit company 
comes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is
always followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves forward 
through subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many characters have similar names 
and features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often repeat. Strange prophecies 
and visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes 
and firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens 
a plantation near the village and ends up massacring thousands 
of striking workers, mirroring the real-life 
‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this produces a sense 
of history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape. Beneath the magic is a story 
about the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history 
from colonial times onward. This is a history that 
the author experienced firsthand. Gabriel García Márquez grew up
in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its Conservative 
and Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and covered the 1958 Venezuelan 
coup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest influences 
were his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a
decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against
Colombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez 
to a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’
omnipresent superstition became the foundation 
of One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca 
where the author spent his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez 
found a unique way to capture the unique history 
of Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality 
of living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive 
the tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism,
the novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected 
on Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the
possibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able
to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned 
to one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever,
a second chance on earth."

**Transcript**:
You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s 
secret vault, secured by a series of combination locks. Fortunately, your treasure map 
has three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm. The last one appears to be missing. Looks like you’re gonna have 
to figure it out on your own. There’s something those 
first two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called 
autobiographical numbers. This is a special type of number 
whose structure describes itself. Each of an autobiographical
number’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that
position occurs within the number. The first digit indicates 
the quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates 
the number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, 
and so on until the end. The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit
autobiographical number. What is it? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations 
would take forever. So let’s analyze the autobiographical 
numbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find. By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits. This makes sense 
since each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific 
digit occurs within the total. So the digits in our 
ten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten. This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have 
too many large digits. For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would 
have to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits. We can conclude 
that there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 
in the entire sequence. So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut. And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers 
that aren’t used. So now we know that our number
must contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater. Now, while this first digit counts 
the number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times
a particular non-zero digit occurs. If we add together 
all the digits besides the first one – and remember, 
zeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many 
non-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit. For example, 
if we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits. Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero 
digits there are after the first digit – two, in our example. Why go through all that? Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits
that occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, 
minus one. And how can you get a distribution
where the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together? The only way is for one 
of the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s. How many 1s? Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional 
digits like 3 or 4 to count them. So now we have the leading digit of 3 
or greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit. And speaking of that, it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is. Since we know that the 2 
and the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6. Now it’s just a matter 
of putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines. The safe swings open, 
and inside you find... Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.

since each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific 
digit occurs within the total. So the digits in our 
ten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten. This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have 
too many large digits. For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would 
have to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits. We can conclude 
that there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 
in the entire sequence. So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut. And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers 
that aren’t used. So now we know that our number
must contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading 
digit must be 3 or greater. Now, while this first digit counts 
the number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times
a particular non-zero digit occurs. If we add together 
all the digits besides the first one – and remember, 
zeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many 
non-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit. For example, 
if we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits. Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero 
digits there are after the first digit – two, in our example. Why go through all that? Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits
that occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, 
minus one. And how can you get a distribution
where the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero 
positive integers being added together? The only way is for one 
of the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s. How many 1s? Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional 
digits like 3 or 4 to count them. So now we have the leading digit of 3 
or greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit. And speaking of that, it’s time to find out 
what the leading digit is. Since we know that the 2 
and the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6. Now it’s just a matter 
of putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines. The safe swings open, 
and inside you find... Da Vinci’s long-lost autobiography.

**Transcript**:
At the annual Athenian 
drama festival in 426 BC, a comic play called The Babylonians, written by a young poet 
named Aristophanes, was awarded first prize. But the play’s depiction of Athens’ 
conduct during the Peloponnesian War was so controversial that afterwards, a politician named Kleon 
took Aristophanes to court for "slandering the people of Athens 
in the presence of foreigners." Aristophanes struck back two years later
with a play called The Knights. In it, he openly mocked Kleon, ending with Kleon’s character working as 
a lowly sausage seller outside the city gates. This style of satire was a consequence of the unrestricted democracy 
of 5th century Athens and is now called "Old Comedy." Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest 
surviving comic dramas, are stuffed full of parodies, songs, 
sexual jokes, and surreal fantasy. They often use wild situations, like a hero flying to heaven 
on a dung beetle, or a net cast over a house to keep 
the owner’s father trapped inside, in order to subvert audience expectations. And they’ve shaped how comedy’s
been written and performed ever since. The word "comedy" comes from 
the Ancient Greek "komos," – revel, and "oide," – singing, and it differed from its companion 
art form, "tragedy" in many ways. Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt 
with the downfall of the high and mighty, their comedies usually ended happily. And where tragedy almost always 
borrowed stories from legend, comedy addressed current events. Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary
people and attacked the powerful. His targets were arrogant politicians, war-mongering generals, and self-important intellectuals, exactly the people who sat in 
the front row of the theatre, where everyone could see their reactions. As a result, they were referred to 
as komoidoumenoi: "those made fun of in comedy." Aristophanes’ vicious 
and often obscene mockery held these leaders to account,
testing their commitment to the city. One issue, in particular, 
inspired much of Aristophanes’ work: the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta. In Peace, written in 421 BC, a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave, where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians. Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC, Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata." In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace. Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations, such as in "Clouds," where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking. The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school, where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right and that a debt is not a debt. No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end. Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis, a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly, often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes. For example, in "Birds," the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize, they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city. Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke, as the play came in second. By exploring new ideas and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society, Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens, but he shaped the nature of comedy itself. Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy, his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere, from slapstick to double acts to impersonations to political satire. Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes, his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed. And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC 
still resonates today: “I’m a comedian, 
so I’ll speak about justice, no matter how hard 
it sounds to your ears.”

until their husbands make peace. Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations, such as in "Clouds," where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking. The hero Strepsiades enrolls in
Socrates’s new philosophical school, where he learns 
how to prove that wrong is right and that a debt is not a debt. No matter how outlandish these plays get,
the heroes always prevail in the end. Aristophanes also became
the master of the parabasis, a comic technique where actors 
address the audience directly, often praising the playwright 
or making topical comments and jokes. For example, in "Birds," the Chorus takes 
the role of different birds and threatens the Athenian judges that
if their play doesn’t win first prize, they’ll defecate on them 
as they walk around the city. Perhaps the judges 
didn’t appreciate the joke, as the play came in second. By exploring new ideas and encouraging self-criticism 
in Athenian society, Aristophanes not only 
mocked his fellow citizens, but he shaped the nature of comedy itself. Hailed by some scholars 
as the father of comedy, his fingerprints are visible 
upon comic techniques everywhere, from slapstick to double acts to impersonations to political satire. Through the praise of free speech 
and the celebration of ordinary heroes, his plays made his audience think 
while they laughed. And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC 
still resonates today: “I’m a comedian, 
so I’ll speak about justice, no matter how hard 
it sounds to your ears.”

**Transcript**:
At the annual Athenian 
drama festival in 426 BC, a comic play called The Babylonians, written by a young poet 
named Aristophanes, was awarded first prize. But the play’s depiction of Athens’ 
conduct during the Peloponnesian War was so controversial that afterwards, a politician named Kleon 
took Aristophanes to court for "slandering the people of Athens 
in the presence of foreigners." Aristophanes struck back two years later
with a play called The Knights. In it, he openly mocked Kleon, ending with Kleon’s character working as 
a lowly sausage seller outside the city gates. This style of satire was a consequence of the unrestricted democracy 
of 5th century Athens and is now called "Old Comedy." Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest 
surviving comic dramas, are stuffed full of parodies, songs, 
sexual jokes, and surreal fantasy. They often use wild situations, like a hero flying to heaven 
on a dung beetle, or a net cast over a house to keep 
the owner’s father trapped inside, in order to subvert audience expectations. And they’ve shaped how comedy’s
been written and performed ever since. The word "comedy" comes from 
the Ancient Greek "komos," – revel, and "oide," – singing, and it differed from its companion 
art form, "tragedy" in many ways. Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt 
with the downfall of the high and mighty, their comedies usually ended happily. And where tragedy almost always 
borrowed stories from legend, comedy addressed current events. Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary
people and attacked the powerful. His targets were arrogant politicians, war-mongering generals, and self-important intellectuals, exactly the people who sat in 
the front row of the theatre, where everyone could see their reactions. As a result, they were referred to 
as komoidoumenoi: "those made fun of in comedy." Aristophanes’ vicious 
and often obscene mockery held these leaders to account,
testing their commitment to the city. One issue, in particular, 
inspired much of Aristophanes’ work: the Peloponnesian War 
between Athens and Sparta. In Peace, written in 421 BC, a middle-aged Athenian frees 
the embodiment of peace from a cave, where she’d been exiled 
by profiteering politicians. Then, in the aftermath of a crushing 
naval defeat for Athens in 411 BC, Aristophanes wrote "Lysistrata." In this play, the women 
of Athens grow sick of war and go on a sex strike 
until their husbands make peace. Other plays use similarly fantastic 
scenarios to skewer topical situations, such as in "Clouds," where Aristophanes mocked 
fashionable philosophical thinking. The hero Strepsiades enrolls in

**Transcript**:
How do we explain the unexplainable? This question has inspired numerous myths, religious practices, and scientific inquiries. But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout 
China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question – why do we need an explanation? For these monks, blindly seeking answers 
was a vice to overcome, and learning to accept
the mysteries of existence was the true path to enlightenment. But fighting the urge to explain 
the unexplainable can be difficult. So to help practice living 
with these mysteries, the meditating monks used a collection 
of roughly 1,700 bewildering and ambiguous philosophical
thought experiments called kōans. The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case." But unlike real-world court cases,
kōans were intentionally incomprehensible. They were surprising, surreal, 
and frequently contradicted themselves. On the surface, they contained a proverb
about the Zen Buddhist monastic code - such as living without physical
or mental attachments, avoiding binary thinking, and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature." But by framing those lessons 
as illogical anecdotes, they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox. By puzzling through 
these confusing “cases," meditating monks could both internalize 
and practice Buddhist teachings. Hopefully, they would let go 
of the search for one true answer and trigger a spiritual breakthrough. Since these are intentionally 
unexplainable, it would be misguided to try 
and decipher these stories ourselves. But like the monks before us, we can puzzle over them together, and investigate just how resistant
they are to simple explanations. Consider this kōan illustrating the
practice of no-attachment. Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido,
are traveling together down a muddy road. Ahead they see an attractive traveler,
unable to cross the muddy path. Tanzan politely offers his help, carrying the traveler 
on his back across the street, and placing her down without a word. Ekido was shocked. According to monastic law,
monks were not supposed to go near women, let alone touch a beautiful stranger. After miles of walking,
Ekido could no longer restrain himself. “How could you carry that woman?” Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there.
Are you still carrying her?” Like all kōans, 
this story has numerous interpretations. But one popular reading suggests that despite never having 
physically carried the traveler, Ekido broke monastic law 
by mentally "clinging to" the woman. This type of conflict – examining the grey area between the letter
of the law and the spirit of the law – was common in kōans. In addition to exploring ambiguity, kōans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding 
of the world around them. One such example finds three monks debating a temple flag 
rippling in the wind. The first monk refers to 
the flag as a moving banner, while the second monk insists 
that they are not seeing the flag move, but rather the wind blowing. They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes, “It is not the flag moving, 
nor the wind blowing, but rather the movement of your minds!” One interpretation of this kōan plays on 
the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks – the first asserting the importance 
of the observable world, the second favoring deeper knowledge 
we can infer from that world. But each monk’s commitment 
to his own “answer” blinds him to the other’s insight, 
and in doing so, defies an essential Buddhist ideal:
abolishing binary thinking. The third monk identifies 
their conflict as a perceptual one – both arguing monks 
fail to see the larger picture. Of course, all these interpretations only
hint at how to wrestle with these kōans. Neither the wisdom 
from practicing monks before us, nor the supposedly wise characters 
in these stories can resolve them for you. That’s because the purpose of these kōans
isn’t reaching a simple solution. It’s the very act of struggling 
with these paradoxical puzzles which challenge our desire for resolution, and our understanding 
of understanding itself.

**Transcript**:
How do we explain the unexplainable? This question has inspired numerous myths, religious practices, and scientific inquiries. But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout 
China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question – why do we need an explanation? For these monks, blindly seeking answers 
was a vice to overcome, and learning to accept
the mysteries of existence was the true path to enlightenment. But fighting the urge to explain 
the unexplainable can be difficult. So to help practice living 
with these mysteries, the meditating monks used a collection 
of roughly 1,700 bewildering and ambiguous philosophical
thought experiments called kōans. The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,
translates to “public record or case." But unlike real-world court cases,
kōans were intentionally incomprehensible. They were surprising, surreal, 
and frequently contradicted themselves. On the surface, they contained a proverb
about the Zen Buddhist monastic code - such as living without physical
or mental attachments, avoiding binary thinking, and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature." But by framing those lessons 
as illogical anecdotes, they became tests to help practicing monks
learn to live with ambiguity and paradox. By puzzling through 
these confusing “cases," meditating monks could both internalize 
and practice Buddhist teachings. Hopefully, they would let go 
of the search for one true answer and trigger a spiritual breakthrough. Since these are intentionally 
unexplainable, it would be misguided to try 
and decipher these stories ourselves. But like the monks before us, we can puzzle over them together, and investigate just how resistant
they are to simple explanations. Consider this kōan illustrating the
practice of no-attachment. Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido,
are traveling together down a muddy road. Ahead they see an attractive traveler,
unable to cross the muddy path. Tanzan politely offers his help, carrying the traveler 
on his back across the street, and placing her down without a word. Ekido was shocked. According to monastic law,
monks were not supposed to go near women, let alone touch a beautiful stranger. After miles of walking,
Ekido could no longer restrain himself. “How could you carry that woman?” Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there.
Are you still carrying her?” Like all kōans, 
this story has numerous interpretations. But one popular reading suggests that despite never having 
physically carried the traveler, Ekido broke monastic law 
by mentally "clinging to" the woman. This type of conflict – examining the grey area between the letter
of the law and the spirit of the law – was common in kōans. In addition to exploring ambiguity, kōans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding 
of the world around them. One such example finds three monks debating a temple flag 
rippling in the wind. The first monk refers to 
the flag as a moving banner, while the second monk insists 
that they are not seeing the flag move, but rather the wind blowing. They argue back and forth, 
until finally, a third monk intervenes, “It is not the flag moving, 
nor the wind blowing, but rather the movement of your minds!” One interpretation of this kōan plays on 
the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks – the first asserting the importance 
of the observable world, the second favoring deeper knowledge 
we can infer from that world. But each monk’s commitment 
to his own “answer” blinds him to the other’s insight, 
and in doing so, defies an essential Buddhist ideal:
abolishing binary thinking. The third monk identifies 
their conflict as a perceptual one – both arguing monks 
fail to see the larger picture. Of course, all these interpretations only
hint at how to wrestle with these kōans. Neither the wisdom 
from practicing monks before us, nor the supposedly wise characters 
in these stories can resolve them for you. That’s because the purpose of these kōans
isn’t reaching a simple solution. It’s the very act of struggling 
with these paradoxical puzzles which challenge our desire for resolution, and our understanding 
of understanding itself.

**Transcript**:
2,300 years ago, the rulers of Alexandria 
set out to fulfill one of humanity’s most audacious goals: to collect all the knowledge in the world 
under one roof. In its prime, the Library of Alexandria housed 
an unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of 
the Greek world’s greatest minds. But by the end of the 5th century CE,
the great library had vanished. Many believed it was destroyed 
in a catastrophic fire. The truth of the library’s rise 
and fall is much more complex. The idea for the library came 
from Alexander the Great. After establishing himself as a conqueror, the former student of Aristotle 
turned his attention to building an empire of knowledge 
headquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built 
with grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are 
no surviving accounts of its architecture. We do know it had lecture halls, 
classrooms, and, of course, shelves. As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with
primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls. He invited scholars to live 
and study in Alexandria at his expense. The library grew as they contributed 
their own manuscripts, but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted 
a copy of every book in the world. Luckily, Alexandria was a hub for ships
traveling through the Mediterranean. Ptolemy III instituted a policy requiring 
any ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over its books for copying. Once the Library’s scribes 
had duplicated the texts, they kept the originals 
and sent the copies back to the ships. Hired book hunters also scoured 
the Mediterranean in search of new texts, and the rulers of Alexandria attempted 
to quash rivals by ending all exports of the Egyptian 
papyrus used to make scrolls. These efforts brought hundreds 
of thousands of books to Alexandria. As the library grew, it became possible to find information 
on more subjects than ever before, but also much more difficult to find 
information on any specific subject. Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of
Cyrene set to work on a solution, creating the pinakes, a 120-volume catalog 
of the library’s contents, the first of its kind. Using the pinakes, others were able to navigate 
the Library’s swelling collection. They made some astounding discoveries. 1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized 
the earth was round, but calculated its circumference 
and diameter within a few miles of their actual size. Heron of Alexandria created 
the world’s first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally reinvented during 
the Industrial Revolution. For about 300 years after its founding 
in 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar 
laid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire. For years, scholars believed the library 
burned as the blaze spread into the city. It's possible the fire destroyed 
part of the sprawling collection, but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit 
the library for centuries after the siege. Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared
as the city changed from Greek, to Roman, Christian, and eventually Muslim hands. Each new set of rulers viewed 
its contents as a threat rather than a source of pride. In 415 CE, the Christian rulers even had 
a mathematician named Hypatia murdered for studying 
the library’s ancient Greek texts, which they viewed as blasphemous. Though the Library of Alexandria 
and its countless texts are long gone, we’re still grappling 
with the best ways to collect, access, and preserve our knowledge. There’s more information available today and more advanced technology 
to preserve it, though we can’t know for sure that our digital archives 
will be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls. And even if our reservoirs of knowledge 
are physically secure, they will still have to resist 
the more insidious forces that tore the library apart: fear of knowledge, and the arrogant belief 
that the past is obsolete. The difference is that, this time, 
we know what to prepare for.

of the library’s contents, the first of its kind. Using the pinakes, others were able to navigate 
the Library’s swelling collection. They made some astounding discoveries. 1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized 
the earth was round, but calculated its circumference 
and diameter within a few miles of their actual size. Heron of Alexandria created 
the world’s first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally reinvented during 
the Industrial Revolution. For about 300 years after its founding 
in 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar 
laid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire. For years, scholars believed the library 
burned as the blaze spread into the city. It's possible the fire destroyed 
part of the sprawling collection, but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit 
the library for centuries after the siege. Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared
as the city changed from Greek, to Roman, Christian, and eventually Muslim hands. Each new set of rulers viewed 
its contents as a threat rather than a source of pride. In 415 CE, the Christian rulers even had 
a mathematician named Hypatia murdered for studying 
the library’s ancient Greek texts, which they viewed as blasphemous. Though the Library of Alexandria 
and its countless texts are long gone, we’re still grappling 
with the best ways to collect, access, and preserve our knowledge. There’s more information available today and more advanced technology 
to preserve it, though we can’t know for sure that our digital archives 
will be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls. And even if our reservoirs of knowledge 
are physically secure, they will still have to resist 
the more insidious forces that tore the library apart: fear of knowledge, and the arrogant belief 
that the past is obsolete. The difference is that, this time,

**Transcript**:
2,300 years ago, the rulers of Alexandria 
set out to fulfill one of humanity’s most audacious goals: to collect all the knowledge in the world 
under one roof. In its prime, the Library of Alexandria housed 
an unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of 
the Greek world’s greatest minds. But by the end of the 5th century CE,
the great library had vanished. Many believed it was destroyed 
in a catastrophic fire. The truth of the library’s rise 
and fall is much more complex. The idea for the library came 
from Alexander the Great. After establishing himself as a conqueror, the former student of Aristotle 
turned his attention to building an empire of knowledge 
headquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans 
for a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built 
with grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are 
no surviving accounts of its architecture. We do know it had lecture halls, 
classrooms, and, of course, shelves. As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with
primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls. He invited scholars to live 
and study in Alexandria at his expense. The library grew as they contributed 
their own manuscripts, but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted 
a copy of every book in the world. Luckily, Alexandria was a hub for ships
traveling through the Mediterranean. Ptolemy III instituted a policy requiring 
any ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over its books for copying. Once the Library’s scribes 
had duplicated the texts, they kept the originals 
and sent the copies back to the ships. Hired book hunters also scoured 
the Mediterranean in search of new texts, and the rulers of Alexandria attempted 
to quash rivals by ending all exports of the Egyptian 
papyrus used to make scrolls. These efforts brought hundreds 
of thousands of books to Alexandria. As the library grew, it became possible to find information 
on more subjects than ever before, but also much more difficult to find 
information on any specific subject. Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of
Cyrene set to work on a solution, creating the pinakes, a 120-volume catalog

**Transcript**:
- Narrator: Imagine giving
birth to a 24 pound baby. That's three times the size of an average human newborn. Ouch. But for kiwi birds, giant chicks are the norm. Females lay a single egg up
to 20% of their body weight, yet when you check out other extreme births
in the animal kingdom, the kiwi can consider itself lucky. Shingleback lizards also
have a tough pregnancy. These reptiles usually have
one to two babies at a time, which doesn't sound so bad, until you realize that combined, the babies make up a third
of the mother's body weight. That's like a human giving
birth to a seven year old! But a baby doesn't need
to be big to be difficult. Take the porcupine. Those sharp spines
protect it from predators, but they're sometimes not so fun for Mom. You see, baby porcupines,
called porcupettes, aren't hairless like most rodent newborns. These guys are born fully quilled. Normally, this isn't a problem for Mom, since the quills are soft at birth, and gradually harden
over the next few hours. But complications can arise when the porcupettes are
facing the wrong direction, because their quills can get caught in the birth canal on the way out. Speaking of birth canals, the spotted hyena has an interesting one. Females have phallic-like genitalia. The scientific term for
this is pseudo-penis, and they give birth out
of the pseudo-penis, which will sometimes rip
apart in the process. It's not only painful, it can be lethal. In fact, about 15% of first-time
mothers die giving birth. But, believe it or not, a species of velvet
spider has it even worse. You know how some animals
chew up food for their babies? Well, Stegodyphus lineatus
takes this to a whole new level. Right after she lays an egg sac, the mother's tissues start to degrade. Once the spiderlings hatch, she regurgitates her
own liquified insides, and the babies chow down. Nine days later, they suck
up the last of her fluids, and strike out on their own, leaving nothing but an empty husk. Thanks Mom. But childbirth isn't just dangerous or uncomfortable for mothers. With some animals, the
baby has it pretty rough. Take the Tasmanian devil. The mom gives birth to
up to 50 joeys at a time, each the size of a raisin. They have to crawl from
the mother's birth canal, over her body, and into her pouch, where they'll snuggle up
for another four months. But there's a catch. Mom has only four nipples in her pouch. So right from birth the joeys are literally on
a mad dash for their lives, and only the strongest four will make it. Talk about sibling rivalry, huh? Overall, one thing is clear: humans aren't the only
ones who have it rough when it comes to giving birth. What's the craziest animal fact you know? Tell us in the comments
and thanks for watching.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
- Narrator: Imagine giving
birth to a 24 pound baby. That's three times the size of an average human newborn. Ouch. But for kiwi birds, giant chicks are the norm. Females lay a single egg up
to 20% of their body weight, yet when you check out other extreme births
in the animal kingdom, the kiwi can consider itself lucky. Shingleback lizards also
have a tough pregnancy. These reptiles usually have
one to two babies at a time, which doesn't sound so bad, until you realize that combined, the babies make up a third
of the mother's body weight. That's like a human giving
birth to a seven year old! But a baby doesn't need
to be big to be difficult. Take the porcupine. Those sharp spines
protect it from predators, but they're sometimes not so fun for Mom. You see, baby porcupines,
called porcupettes, aren't hairless like most rodent newborns. These guys are born fully quilled. Normally, this isn't a problem for Mom, since the quills are soft at birth, and gradually harden
over the next few hours. But complications can arise when the porcupettes are
facing the wrong direction, because their quills can get caught in the birth canal on the way out. Speaking of birth canals, the spotted hyena has an interesting one. Females have phallic-like genitalia. The scientific term for
this is pseudo-penis, and they give birth out
of the pseudo-penis, which will sometimes rip
apart in the process. It's not only painful, it can be lethal. In fact, about 15% of first-time
mothers die giving birth. But, believe it or not, a species of velvet
spider has it even worse. You know how some animals
chew up food for their babies? Well, Stegodyphus lineatus
takes this to a whole new level. Right after she lays an egg sac, the mother's tissues start to degrade. Once the spiderlings hatch, she regurgitates her
own liquified insides, and the babies chow down. Nine days later, they suck
up the last of her fluids, and strike out on their own, leaving nothing but an empty husk. Thanks Mom. But childbirth isn't just dangerous or uncomfortable for mothers. With some animals, the
baby has it pretty rough. Take the Tasmanian devil. The mom gives birth to
up to 50 joeys at a time, each the size of a raisin. They have to crawl from
the mother's birth canal, over her body, and into her pouch, where they'll snuggle up
for another four months. But there's a catch. Mom has only four nipples in her pouch. So right from birth the joeys are literally on
a mad dash for their lives, and only the strongest four will make it. Talk about sibling rivalry, huh? Overall, one thing is clear: humans aren't the only
ones who have it rough when it comes to giving birth. What's the craziest animal fact you know? Tell us in the comments
and thanks for watching.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Though the Tasmanian devil gives birth to __ joeys at a time, only __ newborns can survive.

**Transcript**:
Check out that building with a hole in
it. Here in Hong Kong there are dragons
floating everywhere. You can't really see them, because you know they're dragons.
They actually live up in the mountains and they come down into the water and
when you block them from entering the water you end up really messing up your
luck. So they have accommodated this situation by putting holes in the
buildings so that the dragons can fly through. These are called dragon gates
and they are one of many examples of how Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese practice,
is affecting the skyline of Hong Kong. So Feng Shui is this ancient Chinese
belief, superstition. The basic idea is that there is good energy out there
floating around, good luck, good fortune called Qi and if you arrange your
physical environment in an optimal way, you can channel that good luck in the
best way and things will go good for you. This usually takes the form of like
furniture, interior design but here in Hong Kong, it has affected the skyline. Alright, first let's look at this HSBC
building. The Hong Kong Shanghai Bank was founded back in the days of pirates and
opium barons. First thing you'll notice is that it's nicely squared off, with the
mountains in the back and harbor in the front. This is really good composition for the Qi to flow. Not only is the lobby
elevated but it's also the escalators are at this angle. It's kind of a weird
looking angle. That's intentional as well, because it's actually meant to fend off
the bad luck as it's coming through this hole in the bottom of the building. And then of course the opposite is true; if you don't arrange your physical
environment in an optimal way, then bad luck will befall you. Right next door is
the Communist Bank of Red China. The developers of this building explicitly
ignored the Feng Shui masters who were concerned that the sharp angles of this
design would cut the good Qi and create bad luck for all of the surrounding
buildings. The people who thought this had their suspicions reinforced when
shortly after the building was complete, bad stuff started happening around it. Like to this neighboring building, which has been riddled with financial insecurity, corporate collapse, bankruptcies, since it's very beginning. And Feng Shui
masters have come out and cited the bad Feng Shui of the area as a major cause
for these events. Governor of Hong Kong at the time, whose house sits in the
shadow of this building, died of a fatal heart attack just one year after this
building was complete. So the HSBC building, in response, put up these
maintenance cranes that actually look like cannons and they're pointed right
at the Bank of China, in order to combat all of this bad luck that's coming from
this sharp building. When developers are designing and
putting up these buildings, they hire these Feng Shui consultants. They spend
millions of dollars on consultants who will give them advice and approve their
design decisions, to make sure that they're in keeping with good Feng Shui. Out here in Disneyland Hong Kong, the Feng Shui masters said that the entrance
was in a bad position for keeping good luck in the park. So they shifted the entrance by 12 degrees in order to create a blockade
from the good luck escaping the park and ruining the prosperity of this place. Feng Shui comes from China, mainland China, but during the Cultural Revolution
China kind of stamped out some of these old practices that they believed were
holding the society back. And Feng Shui fell victim to that, but Hong Kong at
that time was ruled by the British. It was a British colony, so it didn't fall
subject to that Cultural Revolution and Feng Shui was preserved in a very
mainstream way. Check out this building, it's the Hopewell Center. When this thing went up, people freaked out because it kind of looked like a candle or like a
smoking cigarette. They put a swimming pool on the top, in order to extinguish
the fire and make sure that it didn't mess with the good luck of the city. The government takes this stuff really seriously too. Between 2011 and 2016 they
paid out $1.1 million dollars in Feng Shui disturbance subsidies. This is paid
out to people who complain that new constructions disrupt their Fung Shui
and they get compensated by the government. So next time you are crossing
this harbor to look at these beautiful buildings, just remember that Feng Shui is at
is at play in Hong Kong's skyline.
