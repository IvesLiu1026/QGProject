**Transcript**:
Today is the annual Sly Wizard Tournament
featuring competitors from the wizarding world’s
three greatest schools, and you’ve been entrusted
with an enormous responsibility. You are to administer the tournament. First, you and you alone will determine
how many events there will be and their scoring system. Then the three wizards will
enter your maze and compete in your chosen
events in utmost secrecy; only you and they will see what happens. The competition begins and... Wow, that was one for the record books. The winner was... wait, you have no idea. The last thing you remember was
a dark wizard showing up and casting a forgetting curse. The competitors seem even more confused—
each is convinced they won. This is bad. There can be no do-overs, and the last failure to declare a winner
set off the first Great Wizarding War. You’ve got to figure this out— and fast. But for the life of you,
you can’t remember a thing. You know you had to follow a few rules: there had to be three or more events,
each with a single winner and loser. Every event used the same scoring system, where first place received more points
than second, and second more than third. All points were positive integers. Maybe there’s a record somewhere...
oh, of course, your scorecard. Well, that leaves something to be desired. All that you wrote down was
that in Calchemy, Newt-niz won,
Leib-ton took second, and that was the only time
Magnificent Marigold’s Magical Macademy got third all day. Oh, and some final scores: one school got 22 points,
and both of the others got 9. Why are you so bad at taking notes?! No time for self-recrimination. The wizarding world is waiting. Who won the tournament? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 At first, it may seem like there are
an overwhelming number of possible scoring systems, so let's see if we can narrow our options. We can start by looking for clues
in the total scores. Every event was scored the same way, so the sum of all points
in the entire tournament must be a multiple of one event’s total. In other words, if there were three events
that scored 3, 2, 1, which adds up to 6,
the total points for the day would be 18, which is three events times 6 points. Our total is 40. So we can make a table of possibilities:
one event totaling 40 points, two totaling 20, four totaling 10,
and so on. We know there were at least three events,
which eliminates these options, and we can also get rid of events
with fewer than 6 points, because the smallest possible total
is 3 plus 2 plus 1. That leaves two prospects. Let’s try to narrow those further
by breaking down the possible points earned in each event: if first place received 7 points, the teams that had totals of 9
couldn’t have won an event because their total score
would be 10 or more. That means the team with 22
would have to have won all four. But then their total would be 28,
so we can eliminate that option. And with four events, these numbers
can't be made to add up to 22. Finally, if first place got 5 points, the highest possible score 
with four events would be 20, getting rid of these two as well. In fact, five events scoring 4 each
could only reach 20 as well. That leaves us with just one possibility: five events each scored 5, 2, 1. There’s exactly one way to make
those scores add up to 22: the winner finished first
four times and second once. The scores of 9 mean one team won once
and lost four times, and the other lost once
and took second four times. That must be Marigold’s Macademy, whose only third place finish
was Calchemy based on your note. And Leib-ton’s second place finish
in Calchemy means they scored 22 and won the Sly Wizard Tournament. You have just enough evidence to prove it,
keep your job, and avert war. Phew!

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This is because both questions deal with the relationship between the total points for the day and the possible scoring systems for each event. The ground truth MCQ asks about the sum of all points in the tournament, while Question 3 asks about what can be concluded about the possible scoring systems given the total points for the day. 

The correct options for both questions also convey the same idea: the sum of points for each event must be a factor or multiple of the total points for the day. 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 does not directly address the scoring requirement, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, as it mentions a scoring system with points allocated to 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places.

But, if I were to choose a question that implies the scoring requirement stated in the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 2 is the closest. It implies that the scoring system is based on multiple events with the same points allocation, which indirectly relates to the scoring requirement stated in the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ based on implication:

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

**Transcript**:
Today is the annual Sly Wizard Tournament
featuring competitors from the wizarding world’s
three greatest schools, and you’ve been entrusted
with an enormous responsibility. You are to administer the tournament. First, you and you alone will determine
how many events there will be and their scoring system. Then the three wizards will
enter your maze and compete in your chosen
events in utmost secrecy; only you and they will see what happens. The competition begins and... Wow, that was one for the record books. The winner was... wait, you have no idea. The last thing you remember was
a dark wizard showing up and casting a forgetting curse. The competitors seem even more confused—
each is convinced they won. This is bad. There can be no do-overs, and the last failure to declare a winner
set off the first Great Wizarding War. You’ve got to figure this out— and fast. But for the life of you,
you can’t remember a thing. You know you had to follow a few rules: there had to be three or more events,
each with a single winner and loser. Every event used the same scoring system, where first place received more points
than second, and second more than third. All points were positive integers. Maybe there’s a record somewhere...
oh, of course, your scorecard. Well, that leaves something to be desired. All that you wrote down was
that in Calchemy, Newt-niz won,
Leib-ton took second, and that was the only time
Magnificent Marigold’s Magical Macademy got third all day. Oh, and some final scores: one school got 22 points,
and both of the others got 9. Why are you so bad at taking notes?! No time for self-recrimination. The wizarding world is waiting. Who won the tournament? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 At first, it may seem like there are
an overwhelming number of possible scoring systems, so let's see if we can narrow our options. We can start by looking for clues
in the total scores. Every event was scored the same way, so the sum of all points
in the entire tournament must be a multiple of one event’s total. In other words, if there were three events
that scored 3, 2, 1, which adds up to 6,
the total points for the day would be 18, which is three events times 6 points. Our total is 40. So we can make a table of possibilities:
one event totaling 40 points, two totaling 20, four totaling 10,
and so on. We know there were at least three events,
which eliminates these options, and we can also get rid of events
with fewer than 6 points, because the smallest possible total
is 3 plus 2 plus 1. That leaves two prospects. Let’s try to narrow those further
by breaking down the possible points earned in each event: if first place received 7 points, the teams that had totals of 9
couldn’t have won an event because their total score
would be 10 or more. That means the team with 22
would have to have won all four. But then their total would be 28,
so we can eliminate that option. And with four events, these numbers
can't be made to add up to 22. Finally, if first place got 5 points, the highest possible score 
with four events would be 20, getting rid of these two as well. In fact, five events scoring 4 each
could only reach 20 as well. That leaves us with just one possibility: five events each scored 5, 2, 1. There’s exactly one way to make
those scores add up to 22: the winner finished first
four times and second once. The scores of 9 mean one team won once
and lost four times, and the other lost once
and took second four times. That must be Marigold’s Macademy, whose only third place finish
was Calchemy based on your note. And Leib-ton’s second place finish
in Calchemy means they scored 22 and won the Sly Wizard Tournament. You have just enough evidence to prove it,
keep your job, and avert war. Phew!

The following statement
is utterly ludicrous. It is also true. The world's most important
advanced technology is nearly all produced
in a single facility. What's more, that facility is located in one of the most geopolitically
fraught areas on Earth, an area in which many analysts believe
that war is inevitable within the decade. The future of artificial intelligence
hangs in the balance. The Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, makes all of the world's
most-advanced AI chips. This includes Nvidia's GPUs,
Google's TPUs, AMD's GPUs, the AI chips for Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Cerebrus, SambaNova and every other credible competitor. Modern artificial intelligence
simply would not be possible without these highly specialized chips. Little wonder, then, that Time magazine recently
described TSMC as, "The world's most important company
that you've probably never heard of." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
put it more colorfully, saying, “Basically,
there is air ... and TSMC.” (Laughter) TSMC's chip fabrication
facilities, or fabs, the buildings where chips
are physically built, is located on the western coast of Taiwan, a mere 110 miles from mainland China. In this map, Taiwan is shown in orange
and China is shown in green. Today, China and Taiwan
are nearer to the brink of war than they have been in decades. Many policymakers in Washington predict
that China will invade Taiwan within the next five years. A China-Taiwan conflict
would be devastating for many reasons. Aside from the heavy human toll, one underappreciated consequence is that it would paralyze
the global AI ecosystem. Put simply, the entire field
of artificial intelligence faces an astonishingly precarious
single point of failure in Taiwan. Amid all of the fervor around AI today, this fact is not widely
enough appreciated. If you are working on
or are interested in AI, you need to be paying attention. How did we get here
and what can we do about it? Let's start with a brief, whirlwind
overview of the chip industry. Semiconductors, or chips,
are the most complex object in the world that humanity knows how to mass-produce. Making semiconductors requires
the world's purest metals, the world's most expensive machinery, legions of highly specialized engineers and atom-level manufacturing precision. It is important to distinguish between two
different types of chip companies. First, fabless chip makers, which design but do not
manufacture their own chips. And second, foundries, which manufacture chips
designed by other companies. Almost every well-known chip
company today is fabless, from Nvidia to AMD to Qualcomm. These companies do not
produce their own chips. Instead, they design chips, and then they rely on foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture
those chips for them. There are only three companies
in the world today that are capable of manufacturing chips anywhere near the leading edge
of semiconductor technology: TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Of those three, only one can reliably produce
the world's most advanced AI chips, including chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs. That one company is TSMC. As of this morning, TSMC's market capitalization
was 470 billion dollars, making it the 13th-largest
company in the world, larger than ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Walmart. How has TSMC become such a dominant force? The short answer is that powerful
economies of scale exist in the world of chip fabrication, leading inexorably
to winner-take-all dynamics. Making advanced semiconductors
requires tremendous upfront and ongoing capital expenditure. In 2021, TSMC announced
that it would invest 100 billion dollars over the next three years to continue expanding
its fabrication capabilities. No other company in the world
can justify that level of investment. TSMC can, because of the sheer volume
of chips that it produces, far more than any other
company in the world. A related dynamic that helps explain
TSMC's unassailable position is what has come to be known
as the TSMC Grand Alliance. TSMC has invested heavily over decades to develop deep partnerships
with dozens of companies across the semiconductor supply chain, from software providers like Cadence to equipment manufacturers like ASML to chip designers like Nvidia. In turn, these companies
have developed their own products in accordance with TSMC's road map, leading to powerful lock-in. In summary, a combination
of economies of scale, network effects, and unrivaled specialization
have made TSMC irreplaceable and have made the entire world deeply,
precariously dependent upon it. This brings us to the present,
delicate geopolitical moment. Last October, the Biden administration
took the dramatic step of banning the export of all high-end
AI chips to any entity in China. The rationale behind
these measures was clear. To leverage US control of the global semiconductor supply chain as a choke point to handicap
China's AI capabilities. The US government is currently formulating
expansions to this policy. At the same time, the US is taking steps
to reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities
located in East Asia. In late 2022, TSMC announced that it would
invest 40 billion dollars to build two new state-of-the-art fabs in the United States, in Arizona. The first of these two fabs is slated
to begin production in 2025. Bringing advanced
chip production to US soil will help mitigate the AI industry's
absolute dependence on Taiwan-based fabs. But the Arizona fabs
will not solve everything. Their production capacity will be modest, representing less than five percent
of TSMC's total global output. And the most advanced semiconductor
production capabilities and technologies will remain in Taiwan. So where might things go from here? Let's briefly consider
a few possibilities on this three-dimensional chessboard. Let's start with optimistic scenario. Taiwan's central role in the global
semiconductor industry is often referred to
as its “silicon shield.” The basic theory is this: because China depends so heavily on Taiwan
for the chips that it needs to keep its own economy running, China will stop short of invading Taiwan
and putting TSMC's production at risk. And because the rest of the world
is likewise so dependent on TSMC, the United States and other powers
will go to great lengths to protect the island
and defend its sovereignty. Under this theory, while China may continue
to build out its military and engage in cross-strait saber-rattling, it will stop short of kinetic
action against Taiwan. But the silicon shield is just a theory, not a guarantee. What would happen if China
were to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly
be rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,
or even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this
valuable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings
were to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be
able to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global
semiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,
equipment and services. These would be denied
to an invading power. Let me say this one more time: if or when China invades Taiwan, TSMC's fabs will,
in all likelihood, go offline. This will mean that no more Nvidia H100s or any other cutting-edge AI chips will be able to be produced
anywhere in the world. What would this mean for the world of AI? After TSMC, the company
best positioned to step up and produce cutting-edge
AI chips is Samsung. Samsung is currently the only company
in the world, other than TSMC, that is capable of producing
three-nanometer chips, today's cutting-edge technology. But Samsung's production capabilities
are far inferior to TSMC's today. In a best-case scenario, it would take Samsung years to scale up to TSMC's current AI
chip yields and volumes. This brings us to America's
former chip champion, Intel. It was hardly a decade ago that Intel's chip-manufacturing
capabilities were the envy of the world. But in recent years,
Intel has fallen behind. The company struggled mightily
in its transition to both ten-nanometer and seven-nanometer node technologies, even resorting to outsourcing some
of its leading edge production to TSMC. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel aspires to regain
its chipmaking supremacy with an ambitious plan to leapfrog TSMC and begin producing
two-nanometer chips in 2024. Whether this ambitious plan will actually
prove achievable, however, remains to be seen. Before we despair too much, let us note a couple encouraging points. First, keep in mind that a considerable
stock of AI chips already exists in the world. And even in a worst-case scenario,
these chips would remain in use. Second, while the most advanced AI chips,
like Google’s TPUs or Nvidia’s H100s, can only be manufactured in Taiwan, there are many fabs around the world, from the US to Europe to Israel, that are capable of producing
lagging-edge logic chips at scale. Though they are far less powerful
than today's leading AI chips, these previous-generation chips
could be used in a pinch to support some AI computing workloads. Ultimately, though, it would be
devastating for humanity to lose its ability to produce the chips that power today's cutting-edge
artificial intelligence. Progress in AI would be
profoundly disrupted. Let us hope that diplomacy prevails. (Applause)

were to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly
be rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,
or even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this
valuable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings
were to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be
able to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global
semiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,
equipment and services. These would be denied
to an invading power. Let me say this one more time: if or when China invades Taiwan, TSMC's fabs will,
in all likelihood, go offline. This will mean that no more Nvidia H100s or any other cutting-edge AI chips will be able to be produced
anywhere in the world. What would this mean for the world of AI? After TSMC, the company
best positioned to step up and produce cutting-edge
AI chips is Samsung. Samsung is currently the only company
in the world, other than TSMC, that is capable of producing
three-nanometer chips, today's cutting-edge technology. But Samsung's production capabilities
are far inferior to TSMC's today. In a best-case scenario, it would take Samsung years to scale up to TSMC's current AI
chip yields and volumes. This brings us to America's
former chip champion, Intel. It was hardly a decade ago that Intel's chip-manufacturing
capabilities were the envy of the world. But in recent years,
Intel has fallen behind. The company struggled mightily
in its transition to both ten-nanometer and seven-nanometer node technologies, even resorting to outsourcing some
of its leading edge production to TSMC. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel aspires to regain
its chipmaking supremacy with an ambitious plan to leapfrog TSMC and begin producing
two-nanometer chips in 2024. Whether this ambitious plan will actually
prove achievable, however, remains to be seen. Before we despair too much, let us note a couple encouraging points. First, keep in mind that a considerable
stock of AI chips already exists in the world. And even in a worst-case scenario,
these chips would remain in use. Second, while the most advanced AI chips,
like Google’s TPUs or Nvidia’s H100s, can only be manufactured in Taiwan, there are many fabs around the world, from the US to Europe to Israel, that are capable of producing
lagging-edge logic chips at scale. Though they are far less powerful
than today's leading AI chips, these previous-generation chips
could be used in a pinch to support some AI computing workloads. Ultimately, though, it would be
devastating for humanity to lose its ability to produce the chips that power today's cutting-edge
artificial intelligence. Progress in AI would be
profoundly disrupted. Let us hope that diplomacy prevails. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
The following statement
is utterly ludicrous. It is also true. The world's most important
advanced technology is nearly all produced
in a single facility. What's more, that facility is located in one of the most geopolitically
fraught areas on Earth, an area in which many analysts believe
that war is inevitable within the decade. The future of artificial intelligence
hangs in the balance. The Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, makes all of the world's
most-advanced AI chips. This includes Nvidia's GPUs,
Google's TPUs, AMD's GPUs, the AI chips for Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Cerebrus, SambaNova and every other credible competitor. Modern artificial intelligence
simply would not be possible without these highly specialized chips. Little wonder, then, that Time magazine recently
described TSMC as, "The world's most important company
that you've probably never heard of." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
put it more colorfully, saying, “Basically,
there is air ... and TSMC.” (Laughter) TSMC's chip fabrication
facilities, or fabs, the buildings where chips
are physically built, is located on the western coast of Taiwan, a mere 110 miles from mainland China. In this map, Taiwan is shown in orange
and China is shown in green. Today, China and Taiwan
are nearer to the brink of war than they have been in decades. Many policymakers in Washington predict
that China will invade Taiwan within the next five years. A China-Taiwan conflict
would be devastating for many reasons. Aside from the heavy human toll, one underappreciated consequence is that it would paralyze
the global AI ecosystem. Put simply, the entire field
of artificial intelligence faces an astonishingly precarious
single point of failure in Taiwan. Amid all of the fervor around AI today, this fact is not widely
enough appreciated. If you are working on
or are interested in AI, you need to be paying attention. How did we get here
and what can we do about it? Let's start with a brief, whirlwind
overview of the chip industry. Semiconductors, or chips,
are the most complex object in the world that humanity knows how to mass-produce. Making semiconductors requires
the world's purest metals, the world's most expensive machinery, legions of highly specialized engineers and atom-level manufacturing precision. It is important to distinguish between two
different types of chip companies. First, fabless chip makers, which design but do not
manufacture their own chips. And second, foundries, which manufacture chips
designed by other companies. Almost every well-known chip
company today is fabless, from Nvidia to AMD to Qualcomm. These companies do not
produce their own chips. Instead, they design chips, and then they rely on foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture
those chips for them. There are only three companies
in the world today that are capable of manufacturing chips anywhere near the leading edge
of semiconductor technology: TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Of those three, only one can reliably produce
the world's most advanced AI chips, including chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs. That one company is TSMC. As of this morning, TSMC's market capitalization
was 470 billion dollars, making it the 13th-largest
company in the world, larger than ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Walmart. How has TSMC become such a dominant force? The short answer is that powerful
economies of scale exist in the world of chip fabrication, leading inexorably
to winner-take-all dynamics. Making advanced semiconductors
requires tremendous upfront and ongoing capital expenditure. In 2021, TSMC announced
that it would invest 100 billion dollars over the next three years to continue expanding
its fabrication capabilities. No other company in the world
can justify that level of investment. TSMC can, because of the sheer volume
of chips that it produces, far more than any other
company in the world. A related dynamic that helps explain
TSMC's unassailable position is what has come to be known
as the TSMC Grand Alliance. TSMC has invested heavily over decades to develop deep partnerships
with dozens of companies across the semiconductor supply chain, from software providers like Cadence to equipment manufacturers like ASML to chip designers like Nvidia. In turn, these companies
have developed their own products in accordance with TSMC's road map, leading to powerful lock-in. In summary, a combination
of economies of scale, network effects, and unrivaled specialization
have made TSMC irreplaceable and have made the entire world deeply,
precariously dependent upon it. This brings us to the present,
delicate geopolitical moment. Last October, the Biden administration
took the dramatic step of banning the export of all high-end
AI chips to any entity in China. The rationale behind
these measures was clear. To leverage US control of the global semiconductor supply chain as a choke point to handicap
China's AI capabilities. The US government is currently formulating
expansions to this policy. At the same time, the US is taking steps
to reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities
located in East Asia. In late 2022, TSMC announced that it would
invest 40 billion dollars to build two new state-of-the-art fabs in the United States, in Arizona. The first of these two fabs is slated
to begin production in 2025. Bringing advanced
chip production to US soil will help mitigate the AI industry's
absolute dependence on Taiwan-based fabs. But the Arizona fabs
will not solve everything. Their production capacity will be modest, representing less than five percent
of TSMC's total global output. And the most advanced semiconductor
production capabilities and technologies will remain in Taiwan. So where might things go from here? Let's briefly consider
a few possibilities on this three-dimensional chessboard. Let's start with optimistic scenario. Taiwan's central role in the global
semiconductor industry is often referred to
as its “silicon shield.” The basic theory is this: because China depends so heavily on Taiwan
for the chips that it needs to keep its own economy running, China will stop short of invading Taiwan
and putting TSMC's production at risk. And because the rest of the world
is likewise so dependent on TSMC, the United States and other powers
will go to great lengths to protect the island
and defend its sovereignty. Under this theory, while China may continue
to build out its military and engage in cross-strait saber-rattling, it will stop short of kinetic
action against Taiwan. But the silicon shield is just a theory, not a guarantee. What would happen if China
were to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly
be rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,
or even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this
valuable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings
were to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be
able to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global
semiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,

in all likelihood, go offline. This will mean that no more Nvidia H100s or any other cutting-edge AI chips will be able to be produced
anywhere in the world. What would this mean for the world of AI? After TSMC, the company
best positioned to step up and produce cutting-edge

in the world, other than TSMC, that is capable of producing
three-nanometer chips, today's cutting-edge technology. But Samsung's production capabilities
are far inferior to TSMC's today. In a best-case scenario, it would take Samsung years to scale up to TSMC's current AI

SciShow is supported by Brilliant.org. { ♪INTRO } The word “contagious” probably conjures
up all sorts of horrific images of Ebola or the
plague— diseases that have a reputation for gruesome, indiscriminate killing. So you might be surprised to hear that when it comes to the world’s most contagious diseases, those don’t even make the top 10. The winners on that list can be ten or more times as contagious as Ebola or the plague, and they aren’t off in some remote jungle or a thing of the past, either. They’re right here, right now. In fact, measles—that almost-eliminated virus now making headlines in places like Washington and New York— is one of the most contagious diseases we know of. And it’s contagiousness is a big part of why it’s making a resurgence. Now, the word “contagious” has a very specific meaning to epidemiologists —the scientists that study how diseases spread. A disease is considered especially contagious if one sick person is likely to infect a lot of other people. And that’s something that can be quantified. The average number of people a single sick person infects is known as a disease’s basic reproduction number or R0. R0 is based on a number of factors, like the rate of contact between infected and susceptible people how long an infected person is contagious, Probability that an uninfected person will contract the disease if they’re around someone who’s sick. Because of that, it’s not a fixed number— there are a lot of varibles that can impact how contagious a pathogen will be in a specific environment. So contagiousness can vary from location to location and outbreak to outbreak When R0 is less than 1, a disease is considered self limiting. Basically it's not going to spread through a population, and will eventually just die out. When R0 is 1, a disease will kind of hang
around, but it won't cause an outbreak Above 1, and things start to look bad because the number of infected people increases exponentially To put that in perspective, the most contagious diseases we know of have double or even triple digit R0s That’s why a disease like ebola—which
has an R0 between 1.5 and 2.5—can cause epidemics but isn’t considered super contagious. It is very infectious, though. Infectiousness is measured by the infective
dose— basically, how many virus particles, spores,
bacterial cells, or other sadistic little vehicles of doom
it actually takes to make you sick. Ebola is also really deadly. So basically, it’s extra-super terrifying. But if someone in your town has ebola,
you could probably hit up the local grocery store
without worrying— that’s not true for really contagious diseases
like measles. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease
that was basically eliminated from the United States
at the turn of this century, but now it’s clawing its way back.
Yay. Measles R0s from previous outbreaks vary a
lot, from about 5 to several hundred depending
on factors like population density and vaccination status. But taken together, it’s clear that if no
one is vaccinated, then an infected person with measles will likely infect more than
a dozen other people, each of whom can go on to infect another dozen or more people,
and so on. And it takes vaccination rates above 95% to
push that R0 to 1 or less to keep it in check. One of the main reasons measles is so contagious
is that, kind of like ebola, it’s really infectious—it doesn’t take a lot of viruses
to get you sick. If you are in close contact with someone who
has measles and you’re unvaccinated, your chances of getting sick are about 90 percent. Meanwhile, during flu season, you probably
breathe in influenza viruses any time you enter an enclosed, public space like an airplane
or a daycare without getting sick… most of the time. Another big reason it gets around is its route
of transmission. Measles can go airborne, where it can linger
for up to two hours. Theoretically, someone with measles can walk
into an elevator, cough, and then two hours later you can walk into the same elevator
and catch it. You don’t even have to be in the same room at the same time! And measles has a way to ensure a lot of little
infectious viruses get into the air with every cough. As they say in real estate, it’s all about
location, location, location. The measles virus makes itself at home in
your trachea, at the top of your respiratory system, so it’s in a prime position to come
out when you cough or sneeze. Other respiratory viruses, like influenza,
have to travel much further in order to get out of your body. And Ebola, by comparison, is spread through
bodily fluids. So you have to come into contact with things
like blood, vomit, or feces in order to become infected. Which is much less likely than the elevator
scenario, though infinitely more disgusting. Also, people with ebola aren’t contagious
until they develop symptoms. So they’re not really likely to wander around during
the contagious period when they can spread the infection. People with measles can be contagious up to
four days before the characteristic rash develops. So they might think they have a cold, shrug
it off, and spend days walk around coughing, sneezing, pushing elevator buttons, shaking
hands, or going to Disneyland, before it even occurs to them they should stay home. This sort of thing happens with other diseases,
too—like the bacterial illness pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Pertussis generally has an R0 of 12 to 17,
which probably has something to do with the fact that adolescents and adults often get
a mild, cold-like version of the disease, or have no symptoms at all. That’s simply not the case with influenza,
which has a low R0 of around 1 or 2. People with the flu are only contagious for about
a day before they develop symptoms. And they’re most contagious when they’re
three or four days in—when they’re most likely in bed. One of the only viruses to top measles’
claim to contagious fame is rotavirus, the nasty stomach bug that’s most common in
children. It has an average R0 of about 25. And that’s probably because, like measles,
it’s extremely infectious, but it’s even hardier. It causes explosive diarrhea and is most common
in children, so, well, you can extrapolate from there how it gets around. Also, the virus is present in an infected
person’s feces before they develop symptoms, and it can last hours on unwashed hands, days on some surfaces, and weeks in drinking water. In fact, small kids with questionable hygiene is a common theme when it comes to super-contagious diseases. That certainly helps measles move around schools and daycares, and it’s part of why chickenpox generally has an R0 of 10 to 12. The virus can be passed through the air, but it’s also present inside the pustules that develop, so it can get all over kids’ hands when they scratch those itchy lumps. The virus that causes chickenpox probably doesn’t survive too long outside the human body, though—which is why it doesn’t quite have the legs that measles does. So, in conclusion, you should stockpile beans, rice, and bottled water and never leave your house. Or, you could take reasonable precautions
against contagious diseases. The contagiousness of viruses like measles is a big part of why we’ve developed vaccines against them—because even if they’re not
as deadly as ebola, they are still deadly. The likelihood someone will die depends a
lot on where they live — in developed countries like the United States it’s around around
a half a percent, but in developing countries it’s closer to 6%. Unfortunately, some people, like young babies or people with compromised immune systems, aren’t able to get those vaccines. So if you want to help protect everyone around you and stay safe yourself, you can get vaccinated and get your children vaccinated on the recommended
schedule. And don’t forget to do the usual common
sense things like wash your hands frequently, and, for the most part, steer clear of other
people’s bodily fluids. I mean, you might luck out and stay healthy no matter what. But taking such simple steps can reduce your odds of getting sick. And
if you want to really understand what it means to reduce those odds, you might want to check out the Probability course on Brilliant.org. Probabilities are all around us all the time, and this course helps you get to know them inside and out by explaining the math that underlies things like poker strategy and weather prediction.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: How did Malik Amar initially rise to power in the sultanate of Amagar? 

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about Malik Ambar's position in Ahmednagar.

Since there isn't an exact match, I will choose the question that is closest in terms of content and intent. 

In this case, the closest match is Question 3, but a more suitable match would be a question that asks about Malik Ambar's position. 

However, Question 9 mentions Malik Amar's marriage of his daughter to the new Sultan, which created a direct tie to the royal family and solidified his position as Regent.

Considering the available options, I would choose Question 9 as a better match in terms of intent, but it's not an exact match.

However, re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 3 has an option that mentions Malik Amar becoming a mercenary soldier and eventually taking advantage of a royal power vacuum, which led to him becoming the Regent.

**Transcript**:
American engineer Percy Spencer developed
World War II RADAR technology that helped detect Nazi airplanes— but it would soon have other
surprising applications. One day in 1945, Spencer was standing
near a RADAR instrument called a magnetron, a device that produced high-intensity
microwaves that could reflect off planes. Suddenly, he noticed that the
candy bar in his pocket had melted. He exposed other things to the magnetron
and, sure enough, popcorn kernels popped, and an egg—well— exploded
onto a colleague. Soon after, the first microwave oven
became available, operating using the very same technology. So, how does it work? All light energy travels in waves of
oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These oscillations span a range
of frequencies comprising the electromagnetic spectrum. The higher the frequency,
the more energetic. Gamma rays and X-rays
have the highest frequencies; microwaves and radio waves,
the lowest. Generally, light’s oscillating electric
field exerts forces on charged particles, like the electrons in a molecule. When light encounters polar molecules,
like water, it can make them rotate, as their positive and negative regions are
pushed and pulled in different directions. The frequency the light is traveling at also determines how it
interacts with matter. Microwaves interact strongly with the
water molecules found in most foods. Essentially, they make the molecules
jostle against each other, creating frictional heat. Household microwave ovens are
fitted with cavity magnetrons. When you activate
a microwave oven, a heated element within the magnetron
ejects electrons, and a strong magnet forces them
to spiral outwards. As they pass over the magnetron’s
metallic cavities, the electrons induce
an oscillating charge, generating a continuous stream
of electromagnetic microwaves. A metal pipe directs the microwaves
into the main food compartment, where they bounce off the metal walls and penetrate a few centimeters
into the food inside. When the microwaves encounter
polar molecules in the food, like water, they make them vibrate
at high frequencies. This can have interesting effects
depending on the food's composition. Oil and sugar absorb fewer
microwaves than water, so if you microwave them alone,
not much happens. But when microwaves encounter
a marshmallow, they heat the moisture trapped
within its gelatin-sugar matrix, making the hot air expand
and the marshmallow puff. Butter is essentially a suspension
of water droplets in fat. When microwaved,
the water rapidly vaporizes, making the butter melt quickly—
and sometimes, a bit violently. So microwaves heat food molecules
mechanically, through friction— but they don't alter them chemically. Soup heated in the microwave
is molecularly indistinguishable from soup heated using a stove or oven. The term “microwave radiation”
can be alarming. But in physics, radiation simply describes
any transfer of energy across a gap. High frequency, ionizing radiation
may be harmful because it can strip electrons
from molecules, including DNA. However, microwaves aren’t energetic
enough to alter chemical bonds. And microwave ovens are designed
to prevent leakage— for safety and efficiency’s sake. Nonetheless, to totally limit exposure, experts recommend simply standing a
few feet away when a microwave oven is on. Microwaving metal is dangerous, 
though, right? Well, it depends. Metals are conductors, meaning their electrons are loosely bound
to their atoms and move freely in response
to electric fields. Instead of absorbing microwave radiation, the metal’s electrons concentrate
on the surface, leading to high voltages at sharp edges,
corners, and small gaps. This includes areas between the creases
on a sheet of aluminum foil, the prongs of a fork, or a metal object
and the microwave oven’s metal walls. Sometimes, voltages get high enough
to strip electrons from the surrounding air molecules. This electrically charged gas, or plasma,
may then form lightning-like sparks and grow as it absorbs more microwaves. Once the oven is turned off,
the plasma dissipates. But not all metal objects
spark in the microwave— though they might make things
cook a little unevenly. In fact, a lot of microwavable packaging

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about ionizing radiation and its potential health risks, while Question 6 asks about the reason for standing a few feet away from a microwave oven when it is in operation. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the safety concerns associated with microwave radiation.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the types of light that are considered ionizing radiation, which is the main focus of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 6, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
American engineer Percy Spencer developed
World War II RADAR technology that helped detect Nazi airplanes— but it would soon have other
surprising applications. One day in 1945, Spencer was standing
near a RADAR instrument called a magnetron, a device that produced high-intensity
microwaves that could reflect off planes. Suddenly, he noticed that the
candy bar in his pocket had melted. He exposed other things to the magnetron
and, sure enough, popcorn kernels popped, and an egg—well— exploded
onto a colleague. Soon after, the first microwave oven
became available, operating using the very same technology. So, how does it work? All light energy travels in waves of
oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These oscillations span a range
of frequencies comprising the electromagnetic spectrum. The higher the frequency,
the more energetic. Gamma rays and X-rays
have the highest frequencies; microwaves and radio waves,
the lowest. Generally, light’s oscillating electric
field exerts forces on charged particles, like the electrons in a molecule. When light encounters polar molecules,
like water, it can make them rotate, as their positive and negative regions are
pushed and pulled in different directions. The frequency the light is traveling at also determines how it
interacts with matter. Microwaves interact strongly with the
water molecules found in most foods. Essentially, they make the molecules
jostle against each other, creating frictional heat. Household microwave ovens are
fitted with cavity magnetrons. When you activate
a microwave oven, a heated element within the magnetron
ejects electrons, and a strong magnet forces them
to spiral outwards. As they pass over the magnetron’s
metallic cavities, the electrons induce
an oscillating charge, generating a continuous stream
of electromagnetic microwaves. A metal pipe directs the microwaves
into the main food compartment, where they bounce off the metal walls and penetrate a few centimeters
into the food inside. When the microwaves encounter
polar molecules in the food, like water, they make them vibrate
at high frequencies. This can have interesting effects
depending on the food's composition. Oil and sugar absorb fewer
microwaves than water, so if you microwave them alone,
not much happens. But when microwaves encounter
a marshmallow, they heat the moisture trapped
within its gelatin-sugar matrix, making the hot air expand
and the marshmallow puff. Butter is essentially a suspension
of water droplets in fat. When microwaved,
the water rapidly vaporizes, making the butter melt quickly—
and sometimes, a bit violently. So microwaves heat food molecules
mechanically, through friction— but they don't alter them chemically. Soup heated in the microwave
is molecularly indistinguishable from soup heated using a stove or oven. The term “microwave radiation”
can be alarming. But in physics, radiation simply describes
any transfer of energy across a gap. High frequency, ionizing radiation
may be harmful because it can strip electrons
from molecules, including DNA. However, microwaves aren’t energetic
enough to alter chemical bonds. And microwave ovens are designed
to prevent leakage— for safety and efficiency’s sake. Nonetheless, to totally limit exposure, experts recommend simply standing a
few feet away when a microwave oven is on. Microwaving metal is dangerous, 
though, right? Well, it depends. Metals are conductors, meaning their electrons are loosely bound
to their atoms and move freely in response
to electric fields. Instead of absorbing microwave radiation, the metal’s electrons concentrate
on the surface, leading to high voltages at sharp edges,
corners, and small gaps. This includes areas between the creases
on a sheet of aluminum foil, the prongs of a fork, or a metal object
and the microwave oven’s metal walls. Sometimes, voltages get high enough
to strip electrons from the surrounding air molecules. This electrically charged gas, or plasma,
may then form lightning-like sparks and grow as it absorbs more microwaves. Once the oven is turned off,
the plasma dissipates. But not all metal objects
spark in the microwave— though they might make things
cook a little unevenly. In fact, a lot of microwavable packaging
takes advantage of this, using a thin metal coating
to crisp the food’s surface. And overall, as long as it doesn't
approach the oven's walls, leaving a metal spoon

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of microwaves and their properties.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the approximate wavelength of microwaves oscillating at 2.5 GHz. While none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic, Question 9 discusses the primary function of the magnetron in a microwave oven, which is to produce high-intensity microwaves.

Although not a direct match, I would recommend Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the topic of microwaves and their generation. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses the wavelength of microwaves.

**Transcript**:
With his appetite for conquest
and knack for combat, the shark god Dakuwaqa was determined
to vanquish all his rivals. Long ago, the ancestral gods of Fiji,
known as kalou vu or simply vu, settled on the Pacific archipelago, each establishing a village
in a different area. Eventually, they metamorphosed
into various forms. Dakuwaqa settled
on resource-rich Cakaudrove and transformed into a shark. But he was unsatisfied. He became proud and greedy,
and wanted to challenge every vu, establish himself as the mightiest,
and dominate all of Fiji’s islands. In his quest for power, Dakuwaqa sped
through the waters toward Rewa, where a quick and cunning eel-shaped vu
tried to stop him in the mouth of a river. Soon, the two were tumbling
through the water, locked in combat. The brawling vu created towering waves, stretching the river further inshore
and flooding nearby coastal communities. In the end, the eel was no match
for Dakuwaqa’s ferocity. After the fight, the Rewa River became
the longest and widest in Fiji, which made nearby communities
especially prone to flooding. But Dakuwaqa didn’t care
what damage he caused, so long as he remained undefeated. Dakuwaqa continued on his rampage,
later vanquishing Masilaca, the small, mischievous shark vu
that lived near Beqa Island. Despite their rocky start,
the two became friends. But one day, Masilaca— perhaps growing
tired of Dakuwaqa’s proud, selfish ways and the chaos he’d caused
across the archipelago— presented a challenge he knew
Dakuwaqa couldn’t resist. Masilaca spoke about a fierce vu
called Rokobakaniceva, who guarded the outer island of Kadavu, and teased that,
until Dakuwaqa defeated them, he couldn’t claim the title
of strongest vu. Before Masilaca could even finish 
describing Rokobakaniceva, Dakuwaqa was jetting through the water
in the direction of Kadavu. As he came close,
Dakuwaqa saw a giant octopus hovering at the entrance to a reef. The octopus vu, Rokobakaniceva,
cared greatly for the people of Kadavu and asked Dakuwaqa politely to stay away
and not intimidate the villagers. Dakuwaqa was only emboldened
by the request. He showed his imposing teeth
and lunged forward to attack. But Rokobakaniceva was prepared. With four tentacles, the octopus vu
remained rooted to a rock on the seafloor and with the remaining four,
captured Dakuwaqa’s body and flipped him over. In this position, his breathing slowed
and his muscles relaxed. He was paralyzed and powerless in a
mysterious state called tonic immobility that some sharks assume when flipped over or when the sensitive pores
of their snout are stimulated. Dakuwaqa was stuck upside down
and struggling to breathe, and Rokobakaniceva’s tentacles wrapped
tighter and tighter around his body. Though still shocked, Dakuwaqa realized the battle was lost
for the first time in his life. In exchange for Rokobakaniceva’s mercy,
he promised that he would change his ways. Instead of menacing the villagers
and other vu, he vowed to protect Fijian fishers
from Kadavu and beyond. Pleased with the pact,
Rokobakaniceva agreed and freed Dakuwaqa. He stayed true to his word—
no longer bragging about dueling vu, conquering coastlines,
and taking tributes. Instead, he began finding satisfaction
in guiding lost people back to their homes and warning local fishers of bad weather
and sinister sea creatures. In return, some of Fiji’s people would
pay homage to Dakuwaqa by pouring a traditional drink— yaqona,
also known as kava— into the ocean. And upon returning safely from fishing
trips with an abundance of catch, they’d throw fish heads back
into the ocean for the sharks— gestures of mutual care to elicit luck and protection from Dakuwaqa himself.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and options provided, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of vu Rokobakaniceva is. While there isn't a direct match, Question 1 mentions Rokobakaniceva as an option, but it's asking about the name of the shark god. 

However, Question 4 asks about the name of the small, mischievous shark vu that lived near Beqa Island, and one of the options is Rokobakaniceva, which is described as an octopus vu in the passage.

Considering the options provided, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's still not a direct match.

If I had to choose, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 4

However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically asks about Rokobakaniceva's type would be a better match.

of strongest vu. Before Masilaca could even finish 
describing Rokobakaniceva, Dakuwaqa was jetting through the water
in the direction of Kadavu. As he came close,
Dakuwaqa saw a giant octopus hovering at the entrance to a reef. The octopus vu, Rokobakaniceva,
cared greatly for the people of Kadavu and asked Dakuwaqa politely to stay away
and not intimidate the villagers. Dakuwaqa was only emboldened
by the request. He showed his imposing teeth
and lunged forward to attack. But Rokobakaniceva was prepared. With four tentacles, the octopus vu
remained rooted to a rock on the seafloor and with the remaining four,
captured Dakuwaqa’s body and flipped him over. In this position, his breathing slowed
and his muscles relaxed. He was paralyzed and powerless in a
mysterious state called tonic immobility that some sharks assume when flipped over or when the sensitive pores
of their snout are stimulated. Dakuwaqa was stuck upside down
and struggling to breathe, and Rokobakaniceva’s tentacles wrapped
tighter and tighter around his body. Though still shocked, Dakuwaqa realized the battle was lost
for the first time in his life. In exchange for Rokobakaniceva’s mercy,
he promised that he would change his ways. Instead of menacing the villagers
and other vu, he vowed to protect Fijian fishers
from Kadavu and beyond. Pleased with the pact,
Rokobakaniceva agreed and freed Dakuwaqa. He stayed true to his word—
no longer bragging about dueling vu, conquering coastlines,
and taking tributes. Instead, he began finding satisfaction
in guiding lost people back to their homes and warning local fishers of bad weather
and sinister sea creatures. In return, some of Fiji’s people would
pay homage to Dakuwaqa by pouring a traditional drink— yaqona,
also known as kava— into the ocean. And upon returning safely from fishing
trips with an abundance of catch, they’d throw fish heads back
into the ocean for the sharks— gestures of mutual care to elicit luck and protection from Dakuwaqa himself.

**Transcript**:
With his appetite for conquest
and knack for combat, the shark god Dakuwaqa was determined
to vanquish all his rivals. Long ago, the ancestral gods of Fiji,
known as kalou vu or simply vu, settled on the Pacific archipelago, each establishing a village
in a different area. Eventually, they metamorphosed
into various forms. Dakuwaqa settled
on resource-rich Cakaudrove and transformed into a shark. But he was unsatisfied. He became proud and greedy,
and wanted to challenge every vu, establish himself as the mightiest,
and dominate all of Fiji’s islands. In his quest for power, Dakuwaqa sped
through the waters toward Rewa, where a quick and cunning eel-shaped vu
tried to stop him in the mouth of a river. Soon, the two were tumbling
through the water, locked in combat. The brawling vu created towering waves, stretching the river further inshore
and flooding nearby coastal communities. In the end, the eel was no match
for Dakuwaqa’s ferocity. After the fight, the Rewa River became
the longest and widest in Fiji, which made nearby communities
especially prone to flooding. But Dakuwaqa didn’t care
what damage he caused, so long as he remained undefeated. Dakuwaqa continued on his rampage,
later vanquishing Masilaca, the small, mischievous shark vu
that lived near Beqa Island. Despite their rocky start,
the two became friends. But one day, Masilaca— perhaps growing
tired of Dakuwaqa’s proud, selfish ways and the chaos he’d caused
across the archipelago— presented a challenge he knew
Dakuwaqa couldn’t resist. Masilaca spoke about a fierce vu
called Rokobakaniceva, who guarded the outer island of Kadavu, and teased that,
until Dakuwaqa defeated them, he couldn’t claim the title
of strongest vu. Before Masilaca could even finish 
describing Rokobakaniceva, Dakuwaqa was jetting through the water
in the direction of Kadavu. As he came close,
Dakuwaqa saw a giant octopus hovering at the entrance to a reef. The octopus vu, Rokobakaniceva,
cared greatly for the people of Kadavu and asked Dakuwaqa politely to stay away
and not intimidate the villagers. Dakuwaqa was only emboldened
by the request. He showed his imposing teeth
and lunged forward to attack. But Rokobakaniceva was prepared. With four tentacles, the octopus vu

for the first time in his life. In exchange for Rokobakaniceva’s mercy,

and other vu, he vowed to protect Fijian fishers
from Kadavu and beyond. Pleased with the pact,

**Transcript**:
In 1947, India achieved independence
from British rule— but this freedom came
at a tremendous cost. The region had been split in two,
displacing over 10 million residents and leading to riots that saw the deaths
of roughly 1 million people. Jawaharlal Nehru, 
India’s first prime minister, was eager to usher his country
towards a brighter, united future. And one of the projects that would prove
most essential to realizing this vision was the construction of Chandigarh: a modern metropolis designed to symbolize
“the nation’s faith in the future.” But the path to Nehru’s futurist city
was far from simple. Since money was tight
for the burgeoning nation, the project was only able to secure
a budget of 175 million rupees. That’s the modern equivalent
of roughly 500 million US dollars— which is barely enough to build
a pair of skyscrapers today. The project also had low public support because the plans required the
further displacement of local villages. The government compensated protesting
residents with funds to buy new homes. But their agricultural lands would
still be overtaken by the new city. Nehru’s plan for unity
was off to a rocky start. But the city’s plans were as inspiring
as they were innovative. In 1949, Nehru commissioned
American architect Albert Mayer, whose initial designs laid out
green spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems. When Mayer left the project
due to his business partner’s death, his plans were taken even further
by renowned French architect Le Corbusier. Known as one of the fathers
of modern architecture, Le Corbusier prioritized functional
designs devoid of ornamentation. His style championed unornamented concrete
for creating efficient structures that prioritized function over decoration. Building on Mayer’s plans, Le Corbusier introduced the metaphor
of a human body to describe and design
Chandigarh’s urban environment. The head of the city would comprise
the main administrative area. Alongside the State Secretariat,
Parliamentary Assembly and High Court, the complex included symbolic structures
like the Martyr’s Memorial, dedicated to those who perished fighting
for Indian independence. From the head, residents could travel
down the city’s circulatory system: a network of roads and pathways
known as the 7Vs. These hierarchical roads connected
Chandigarh to other cities while seamlessly linking
the sectors within for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Chandigarh’s heart was Sector 17—
a commercial district housing large shops, offices, a parade ground,
and the main interstate bus terminal. And the city’s lungs took the form
of a continuous Leisure Valley. This series of green belts was modeled
after the popular garden city concept, which sought to increase green cover and guarantee all residents access
to fresh air and open space. Taken as a whole, these plans were
unprecedented, daring, and expensive. Fortunately, Le Corbusier’s streamlined
modernist aesthetic helped keep costs low. Most structures were built of brick,
which was left unpainted and unplastered. Even the city’s grandest concrete
buildings remain naked to this day. And since the budget couldn’t accommodate
mechanical heating and cooling systems, Chandigarh was designed
with passive cooling and ventilation built into every structure. Other tropical cities employed
similar techniques on a smaller scale, but in Chandigarh every room
had direct access to adequate sunlight and ventilation. Overhangs provided shade during the summer
and let in heat during the winter. And today, the energy efficiency
of Chandigarh’s many brick buildings has made the city famous
for its eco-friendly design. Of course, neither Chandigarh’s
past nor present is perfect. The hierarchy of housing types
resulted in segregation between affluent, large households
and small, denser plots. And the city’s focus on residential
and government buildings prevented the development
of other industries. But many other elements of Mayer and
Le Corbusier’s plans have aged quite well. Thousands of trees and open spaces
make it one of India’s greenest cities. And its high quality of life continues
to make Chandigarh one of the most desirable cities to live
in the nation. Over 60 years after its construction, Chandigarh remains an international
exemplar of urban design.

down the city’s circulatory system: a network of roads and pathways
known as the 7Vs. These hierarchical roads connected
Chandigarh to other cities while seamlessly linking
the sectors within for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Chandigarh’s heart was Sector 17—
a commercial district housing large shops, offices, a parade ground,
and the main interstate bus terminal. And the city’s lungs took the form
of a continuous Leisure Valley. This series of green belts was modeled
after the popular garden city concept, which sought to increase green cover and guarantee all residents access
to fresh air and open space. Taken as a whole, these plans were
unprecedented, daring, and expensive. Fortunately, Le Corbusier’s streamlined
modernist aesthetic helped keep costs low. Most structures were built of brick,
which was left unpainted and unplastered. Even the city’s grandest concrete
buildings remain naked to this day. And since the budget couldn’t accommodate
mechanical heating and cooling systems, Chandigarh was designed
with passive cooling and ventilation built into every structure. Other tropical cities employed
similar techniques on a smaller scale, but in Chandigarh every room
had direct access to adequate sunlight and ventilation. Overhangs provided shade during the summer
and let in heat during the winter. And today, the energy efficiency
of Chandigarh’s many brick buildings has made the city famous
for its eco-friendly design. Of course, neither Chandigarh’s
past nor present is perfect. The hierarchy of housing types
resulted in segregation between affluent, large households
and small, denser plots. And the city’s focus on residential
and government buildings prevented the development
of other industries. But many other elements of Mayer and
Le Corbusier’s plans have aged quite well. Thousands of trees and open spaces
make it one of India’s greenest cities. And its high quality of life continues
to make Chandigarh one of the most desirable cities to live
in the nation. Over 60 years after its construction, Chandigarh remains an international
exemplar of urban design.

**Transcript**:
In 1947, India achieved independence
from British rule— but this freedom came
at a tremendous cost. The region had been split in two,
displacing over 10 million residents and leading to riots that saw the deaths
of roughly 1 million people. Jawaharlal Nehru, 
India’s first prime minister, was eager to usher his country
towards a brighter, united future. And one of the projects that would prove
most essential to realizing this vision was the construction of Chandigarh: a modern metropolis designed to symbolize
“the nation’s faith in the future.” But the path to Nehru’s futurist city
was far from simple. Since money was tight
for the burgeoning nation, the project was only able to secure
a budget of 175 million rupees. That’s the modern equivalent
of roughly 500 million US dollars— which is barely enough to build
a pair of skyscrapers today. The project also had low public support because the plans required the
further displacement of local villages. The government compensated protesting
residents with funds to buy new homes. But their agricultural lands would
still be overtaken by the new city. Nehru’s plan for unity
was off to a rocky start. But the city’s plans were as inspiring
as they were innovative. In 1949, Nehru commissioned
American architect Albert Mayer, whose initial designs laid out
green spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems. When Mayer left the project
due to his business partner’s death, his plans were taken even further
by renowned French architect Le Corbusier. Known as one of the fathers
of modern architecture, Le Corbusier prioritized functional
designs devoid of ornamentation. His style championed unornamented concrete
for creating efficient structures that prioritized function over decoration. Building on Mayer’s plans, Le Corbusier introduced the metaphor
of a human body to describe and design
Chandigarh’s urban environment. The head of the city would comprise
the main administrative area. Alongside the State Secretariat,
Parliamentary Assembly and High Court, the complex included symbolic structures
like the Martyr’s Memorial, dedicated to those who perished fighting
for Indian independence. From the head, residents could travel

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 5 does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly, I will continue to analyze the generated MCQs to find the closest match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of the questions directly ask about the "lungs of the city" or "Leisure Valley" specifically. However, Question 6 mentions the "7Vs" which is related to the city's design, and Question 5 mentions the metaphor of the human body used to describe the city's design, which includes the concept of the "lungs" (Leisure Valley).

Given the available options, I would say that Question 5 is still the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Deep inside the Sumatran rainforest,
a carrion fly descends, guided by the scent
of its favorite place to lay eggs: dead and rotting animal carcasses. But when it lands,
it isn’t on liquefying flesh, but instead on the world’s biggest,
and perhaps strangest, flower— Rafflesia arnoldii. Rafflesia is a genus of over 30 species found across the tropical forests
of Southeast Asia. While its smallest representative has
a flower only a few centimeters wide, its biggest weighs seven kilograms
and spans over a meter wide. And its putrid aroma isn’t the only thing
that sets these plants apart— all Rafflesia are parasites. For most of its life, the Rafflesia plant
exists as an endophyte, a single thin strand of almost uniform
cells beneath the bark of its host. It strictly infects Tetrastigma, a genus of large vines
related to the grape. Like typical leafy plants, the host
Tetrastigma’s cells contain chloroplasts. These organelles convert
sunlight into energy and are each equipped with their own DNA. Rafflesia’s plastids, on the other hand,
appear to have lost their DNA, and with it the ability
to photosynthesize. This sort of loss is incredibly rare. With no roots and no ability
to produce its own food, Rafflesia is completely dependent
on its host, siphoning the Tetrastigma’s water
and nutrients to fuel its own growth. And Rafflesia’s propensity for theft
doesn’t end there. Using a process known
as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT, Rafflesia has stolen quite a bit
of genetic material from its host and other plants in its habitat. While HGT is well known in bacteria, it has only recently been documented
in parasitic plants. And scientists are still
trying to understand exactly how this DNA transfer happens. Rafflesia appears to utilize several
of these stolen sequences as if they were their own, transcribing the DNA into RNA
and then translating it into proteins, which are used in key cellular processes. After living some time embedded
in the host vine, Rafflesia emerges as a single bud, which then takes several months,
or even a year, to reach full size. When it opens, its fleshy maroon petals emit several foul-smelling
sulfur-containing compounds. The evolutionary reason for this odor
is relatively straightforward: to attract pollinators. For most species of Rafflesia,
single flowers are either male or female. So, to produce a seed, pollen must be transferred
from one flower to the next. The rotten stench is ideal for attracting
corpse-loving carrion flies, and the massive size of the flower
may help broadcast it through the stagnant rainforest air. A deceived fly will explore
the flower’s interior, laying thousands of ill-fated eggs. But during the fly’s visit, the male Rafflesia’s liquid pollen may
end up on the fly’s back where it dries. If the fly encounters
an open female Rafflesia flower, the pollen will rehydrate when rubbed
against the flower’s damp stigma, completing cross-pollination. A pollinated Rafflesia flower
gradually withers and turns black, but this doesn't mean it's dead. Over several months, a fruit forms
which contains thousands of tiny seeds. But what disperses these seeds
is still debated, with hypotheses ranging
from elephants to rodents to ants. We do know that the seeds have
an oily appendage called an elaiosome, a structure ants often
feed to their larvae. And scientists have even observed
ants carrying Rafflesia seeds. But what happens to the Rafflesia seeds
once inside the ant nest remains unclear. In any case, nobody has seen
Rafflesia seeds germinate, or attach to and infect a host root. Because this crucial step of their
development is still not fully understood, cultivation of Rafflesia is difficult. Despite many attempts,
botanists from around the globe have been largely unsuccessful
at growing Rafflesia from seeds outside its natural habitat. As these tropical forests
are under threat, we’re at risk of losing Rafflesia, and our ability to unravel
some of its many remaining secrets.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the diameter of Rafflesia flowers, while the generated MCQs cover various aspects of Rafflesia's biology, ecology, and conservation.

Although there isn't a direct match, I would recommend Question 1 as the most similar generated MCQ, but only because it mentions a distinctive feature of Rafflesia (the foul-smelling odor), which is also mentioned in the transcript as a characteristic of the flower. However, please note that this is a weak connection, and the question intents are not identical.

If I had to choose, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

However, I would like to emphasize that the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of Rafflesia flower diameter, and a new MCQ that specifically targets this topic would be more suitable.

from one flower to the next. The rotten stench is ideal for attracting
corpse-loving carrion flies, and the massive size of the flower
may help broadcast it through the stagnant rainforest air. A deceived fly will explore
the flower’s interior, laying thousands of ill-fated eggs. But during the fly’s visit, the male Rafflesia’s liquid pollen may
end up on the fly’s back where it dries. If the fly encounters
an open female Rafflesia flower, the pollen will rehydrate when rubbed
against the flower’s damp stigma, completing cross-pollination. A pollinated Rafflesia flower
gradually withers and turns black, but this doesn't mean it's dead. Over several months, a fruit forms
which contains thousands of tiny seeds. But what disperses these seeds
is still debated, with hypotheses ranging
from elephants to rodents to ants. We do know that the seeds have
an oily appendage called an elaiosome, a structure ants often
feed to their larvae. And scientists have even observed
ants carrying Rafflesia seeds. But what happens to the Rafflesia seeds
once inside the ant nest remains unclear. In any case, nobody has seen
Rafflesia seeds germinate, or attach to and infect a host root. Because this crucial step of their
development is still not fully understood, cultivation of Rafflesia is difficult. Despite many attempts,
botanists from around the globe have been largely unsuccessful
at growing Rafflesia from seeds outside its natural habitat. As these tropical forests
are under threat, we’re at risk of losing Rafflesia, and our ability to unravel
some of its many remaining secrets.

**Transcript**:
Deep inside the Sumatran rainforest,
a carrion fly descends, guided by the scent
of its favorite place to lay eggs: dead and rotting animal carcasses. But when it lands,
it isn’t on liquefying flesh, but instead on the world’s biggest,
and perhaps strangest, flower— Rafflesia arnoldii. Rafflesia is a genus of over 30 species found across the tropical forests
of Southeast Asia. While its smallest representative has
a flower only a few centimeters wide, its biggest weighs seven kilograms
and spans over a meter wide. And its putrid aroma isn’t the only thing
that sets these plants apart— all Rafflesia are parasites. For most of its life, the Rafflesia plant
exists as an endophyte, a single thin strand of almost uniform
cells beneath the bark of its host. It strictly infects Tetrastigma, a genus of large vines
related to the grape. Like typical leafy plants, the host
Tetrastigma’s cells contain chloroplasts. These organelles convert
sunlight into energy and are each equipped with their own DNA. Rafflesia’s plastids, on the other hand,
appear to have lost their DNA, and with it the ability
to photosynthesize. This sort of loss is incredibly rare. With no roots and no ability
to produce its own food, Rafflesia is completely dependent
on its host, siphoning the Tetrastigma’s water
and nutrients to fuel its own growth. And Rafflesia’s propensity for theft
doesn’t end there. Using a process known
as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT, Rafflesia has stolen quite a bit
of genetic material from its host and other plants in its habitat. While HGT is well known in bacteria, it has only recently been documented
in parasitic plants. And scientists are still
trying to understand exactly how this DNA transfer happens. Rafflesia appears to utilize several
of these stolen sequences as if they were their own, transcribing the DNA into RNA
and then translating it into proteins, which are used in key cellular processes. After living some time embedded
in the host vine, Rafflesia emerges as a single bud, which then takes several months,
or even a year, to reach full size. When it opens, its fleshy maroon petals emit several foul-smelling
sulfur-containing compounds. The evolutionary reason for this odor
is relatively straightforward: to attract pollinators. For most species of Rafflesia,
single flowers are either male or female. So, to produce a seed, pollen must be transferred
from one flower to the next. The rotten stench is ideal for attracting
corpse-loving carrion flies, and the massive size of the flower
may help broadcast it through the stagnant rainforest air. A deceived fly will explore
the flower’s interior, laying thousands of ill-fated eggs. But during the fly’s visit, the male Rafflesia’s liquid pollen may

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not directly ask about the difference between horizontal and vertical gene transfer, it does analyze the role of horizontal gene transfer in Rafflesia's development. Option B of Question 7 mentions that horizontal gene transfer enables Rafflesia to steal genetic material from its host and other plants, which is related to the concept of horizontal gene transfer involving the movement of genes between different species without sexual reproduction.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
In 1969, Dr. Donald Goodwin gathered
a group of study participants and asked them each to recall the object
he'd shown them two minutes prior. The twist? All the participants
were very intoxicated. Despite this, most could pay attention
to the task and correctly name the toy
they had just seen. Yet, when Donald asked them to recall
that object a mere 30 minutes later, half the participants drew a blank, having “blacked out” the earlier
moment entirely. This study illustrates the strange
and somewhat selective effects alcohol has on the brain. Many intoxicated people can perform
complex tasks like holding a detailed conversation
or navigating a walk home. Yet for those experiencing what
is known as a blackout, the memory of these events
is quickly forgotten. So how does alcohol cause
these memory lapses? First, let's identify the culprit. While a single drink often contains
hundreds of different chemical compounds, ethanol is responsible for alcohol's
effects on the brain. Ethanol is lightweight and lipophilic, meaning its structure easily dissolves
into fats, like those in the membranes
of the outer blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain,
ethanol’s unique structure allows it to bind to, interact, and affect
many different neuronal receptors, impairing pathways that allow you to make
careful decisions, control your impulses, and even manage your motor skills. And the networks that control memory
seem to be especially sensitive to alcohol’s effects. Typically, information about your
surroundings is taken in by your sensory organs
and sent to the brain. Neurons transfer this information
to one another via chemical messengers
called neurotransmitters, which are released by one neuron
and received by receptors at another. When a neurotransmitter
binds to a receptor, it unlocks an internal channel,
allowing small ions to flow into the cell. If enough ions enter the cell,
the neuron fires, sending the signal forward. Through this process,
different regions of the brain can communicate with one another
in milliseconds, creating our moment-to-moment
understanding of the world. But ethanol interacts with receptors, making it harder for neurons
to communicate. While compromised, the brain is
still able to transfer information, which is why many intoxicated people
seem somewhat capable of performing basic tasks. In other words, brain function
is highly impaired, but not completely broken. But memory storage is a different story. The transfer of
moment-to-moment understanding to something we can remember
is thought to depend on a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP. LTP happens throughout the brain, but is especially important
in learning and memory regions, like the neocortex and the hippocampus. During LTP, the firing of a neuron triggers
physical changes to its structure. For example, more receptors may be
moved to the cell's surface, making the neuron more sensitive
to future signaling from its neighbors. These physical changes increase
the likelihood that a cell will fire again at that connection, strengthening the wiring between neurons. And through this stronger connection, it's thought that a stable
memory is formed. Yet studies suggest that ethanol has
a unique ability to disrupt LTP, blocking the physical changes
needed for memory formation. So, while moment-to-moment information
is encoded and understood, the storage of that information
is blunted, resulting in a blackout. Of course, not all levels of drinking
result in blackouts. They happen when the concentration
of alcohol in the blood, or BAC, exceeds a certain level,
approximately 0.16. But there’s no magic number. At slightly lower BACs, brownouts,
or the spotty memory of events, can occur, as some neurons continue to function
properly while others fail. And drinking too much can cause
a person to pass out altogether. Other factors like dehydration level,
genetic differences, medications, and even how much you’ve eaten
can affect the likelihood of a blackout. And teenagers appear to be
especially vulnerable due to the substantial changes
in brain development during those years. Alcohol’s short-term effects
usually don’t last longer than the time it takes for their body
to metabolize it, or about a day. But repeatedly over-drinking can damage
neurons and permanently impair memory. It can also harm other organs
like the liver, which works overtime
breaking down alcohol. After all, experiencing a blackout
or witnessing others in this compromised state can be a lot for your mind
and body to process.

**Transcript**:
In 1969, Dr. Donald Goodwin gathered
a group of study participants and asked them each to recall the object
he'd shown them two minutes prior. The twist? All the participants
were very intoxicated. Despite this, most could pay attention
to the task and correctly name the toy
they had just seen. Yet, when Donald asked them to recall
that object a mere 30 minutes later, half the participants drew a blank, having “blacked out” the earlier
moment entirely. This study illustrates the strange
and somewhat selective effects alcohol has on the brain. Many intoxicated people can perform
complex tasks like holding a detailed conversation
or navigating a walk home. Yet for those experiencing what
is known as a blackout, the memory of these events
is quickly forgotten. So how does alcohol cause
these memory lapses? First, let's identify the culprit. While a single drink often contains
hundreds of different chemical compounds, ethanol is responsible for alcohol's
effects on the brain. Ethanol is lightweight and lipophilic, meaning its structure easily dissolves
into fats, like those in the membranes
of the outer blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain,
ethanol’s unique structure allows it to bind to, interact, and affect
many different neuronal receptors, impairing pathways that allow you to make
careful decisions, control your impulses, and even manage your motor skills. And the networks that control memory
seem to be especially sensitive to alcohol’s effects. Typically, information about your
surroundings is taken in by your sensory organs
and sent to the brain. Neurons transfer this information
to one another via chemical messengers
called neurotransmitters, which are released by one neuron
and received by receptors at another. When a neurotransmitter
binds to a receptor, it unlocks an internal channel,
allowing small ions to flow into the cell. If enough ions enter the cell,
the neuron fires, sending the signal forward. Through this process,
different regions of the brain can communicate with one another
in milliseconds, creating our moment-to-moment
understanding of the world. But ethanol interacts with receptors, making it harder for neurons
to communicate. While compromised, the brain is
still able to transfer information, which is why many intoxicated people
seem somewhat capable of performing basic tasks. In other words, brain function
is highly impaired, but not completely broken. But memory storage is a different story. The transfer of
moment-to-moment understanding to something we can remember
is thought to depend on a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP. LTP happens throughout the brain, but is especially important
in learning and memory regions, like the neocortex and the hippocampus. During LTP, the firing of a neuron triggers
physical changes to its structure. For example, more receptors may be
moved to the cell's surface, making the neuron more sensitive
to future signaling from its neighbors. These physical changes increase
the likelihood that a cell will fire again at that connection, strengthening the wiring between neurons. And through this stronger connection, it's thought that a stable
memory is formed. Yet studies suggest that ethanol has
a unique ability to disrupt LTP, blocking the physical changes
needed for memory formation. So, while moment-to-moment information
is encoded and understood, the storage of that information
is blunted, resulting in a blackout. Of course, not all levels of drinking
result in blackouts. They happen when the concentration
of alcohol in the blood, or BAC, exceeds a certain level,
approximately 0.16. But there’s no magic number. At slightly lower BACs, brownouts,
or the spotty memory of events, can occur, as some neurons continue to function
properly while others fail. And drinking too much can cause
a person to pass out altogether. Other factors like dehydration level,
genetic differences, medications, and even how much you’ve eaten
can affect the likelihood of a blackout. And teenagers appear to be
especially vulnerable due to the substantial changes
in brain development during those years. Alcohol’s short-term effects
usually don’t last longer than the time it takes for their body
to metabolize it, or about a day. But repeatedly over-drinking can damage
neurons and permanently impair memory. It can also harm other organs
like the liver, which works overtime
breaking down alcohol. After all, experiencing a blackout
or witnessing others in this compromised state can be a lot for your mind
and body to process.

**Transcript**:
Dodos are commonly considered
brainless, blundering birds that were poorly adapted
and doomed to die off, making their human-mediated extinction
effortless and inevitable. But that's not the case. So, what were dodos actually like?
And what really caused their downfall? Let's start at their origin. Okay, rewinding more than
20 million years, some tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia
voyaged across the Indian Ocean, perhaps by gradually journeying
from island to island. Eventually, their descendants came to a
remote archipelago east of Madagascar. Those that settled likely
diversified over time. Then, about 8 million years ago, an underwater volcano formed another
island on the chain, which would come to be known as Mauritius. Some of the birds populated
this new island, too, and down the line,
dodos emerged as a distinct species. They shared Mauritius with bats, lizards,
giant tortoises, and other birds. The closest large predators were held
back by about 800 kilometers of ocean, so getting murdered was basically
a non-issue. Without the need for defensive
adaptations, like flight, expending energy on them
would have been wasteful. So, as with the kākāpōs of New Zealand
and the cormorants of the Galápagos, their flight muscles shrank. Dodos probably nested
on the island's forest floor, feasting on fruits and seeds. Reaching just under a meter tall, they were among the island's
largest animals. And they were well-adapted
to their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry
and wet conditions. They also survived some major disruptions. Around 4,300 years ago, a megadrought caused waves
of mass mortality events on Mauritius. Fresh water grew scarce
and lakes likely grew saltier and became treacherous traps. This lasted for around 150 years. However, dodos prevailed...
until a few millennia later, when everything changed— quickly. In 1598, Dutch sailors came
ashore on Mauritius, and the island soon became
a welcome stopover for their trade ships. The sailors described natural wonders, including large numbers of birds
twice as big as swans and tortoises with shells huge enough
to fit 10 men. Mauritian animals hadn't evolved
to fear being hunted by humans, so they were an easy catch. Sailors ate some dodos,
but this alone didn't cause their doom. The Dutch sailors came with company. They brought macaques
that were probably pets. They released goats and pigs
on the island to establish food sources. And at some point, sailors also
inadvertently introduced rats. It's thought that goats and pigs grazed
and rooted through the forest understory, which dodos lived in; pigs, macaques, and rats preyed
on dodo eggs and chicks; and all of them competed with dodos
for resources. Dodos were last seen less than a century
after Dutch arrival. At the time, people didn't recognize
that species could disappear. It wasn't until a century later,
in the 1790s, that a scientist conclusively demonstrated
the concept of extinction. By then, many thought dodos were fake. But discoveries from digs and sparse
remains helped confirm their existence. Nevertheless, representations of dodos
were misleading. One popular natural history text
of the late 1700s characterized them as stupid,
voracious, and grotesque. Once Lewis Carroll included a dodo in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
in 1865, the birds quickly amassed popularity. But dodos continued being framed as inept,
clumsy, lazy, and unfit for survival in scholarly works, satirical magazines,
and children's poems alike. And yet, there's no evidence that dodos
were less intelligent than their relatives. The dodo's brain size relative to its body
was similar to that of other pigeons. And especially rotund dodo depictions
are misleading. They may have been inspired by what dodos
looked like during mating displays or in captivity— or they were just
poor artistic renderings. Scientists think dodos were
fairly muscular birds. All in all, the dodo was, in fact,
a survivor that withstood major natural disasters
and thrived on its island home. It simply wasn't prepared for a sudden
onslaught of invasive species. And neither were other
endemic Mauritian animals, including raven parrots, fruit bats,
and giant tortoises. In the aftermath, perhaps it was easier
to declare the dodo's extinction the result of its personal failing
than to admit it was a human one.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not directly ask about the type of bird a dodo is.

A more suitable match can be found in the options of Question 7, which compares the dodo's brain size to other pigeons, indirectly implying that dodos are a type of pigeon.

**Transcript**:
Dodos are commonly considered
brainless, blundering birds that were poorly adapted
and doomed to die off, making their human-mediated extinction
effortless and inevitable. But that's not the case. So, what were dodos actually like?
And what really caused their downfall? Let's start at their origin. Okay, rewinding more than
20 million years, some tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia
voyaged across the Indian Ocean, perhaps by gradually journeying
from island to island. Eventually, their descendants came to a
remote archipelago east of Madagascar. Those that settled likely
diversified over time. Then, about 8 million years ago, an underwater volcano formed another
island on the chain, which would come to be known as Mauritius. Some of the birds populated
this new island, too, and down the line,
dodos emerged as a distinct species. They shared Mauritius with bats, lizards,
giant tortoises, and other birds. The closest large predators were held
back by about 800 kilometers of ocean, so getting murdered was basically
a non-issue. Without the need for defensive
adaptations, like flight, expending energy on them
would have been wasteful. So, as with the kākāpōs of New Zealand
and the cormorants of the Galápagos, their flight muscles shrank. Dodos probably nested
on the island's forest floor, feasting on fruits and seeds. Reaching just under a meter tall, they were among the island's
largest animals. And they were well-adapted
to their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry
and wet conditions. They also survived some major disruptions. Around 4,300 years ago, a megadrought caused waves
of mass mortality events on Mauritius. Fresh water grew scarce
and lakes likely grew saltier and became treacherous traps. This lasted for around 150 years. However, dodos prevailed...
until a few millennia later, when everything changed— quickly. In 1598, Dutch sailors came
ashore on Mauritius, and the island soon became
a welcome stopover for their trade ships. The sailors described natural wonders, including large numbers of birds
twice as big as swans and tortoises with shells huge enough
to fit 10 men. Mauritian animals hadn't evolved
to fear being hunted by humans, so they were an easy catch. Sailors ate some dodos,
but this alone didn't cause their doom. The Dutch sailors came with company. They brought macaques
that were probably pets. They released goats and pigs
on the island to establish food sources. And at some point, sailors also
inadvertently introduced rats. It's thought that goats and pigs grazed
and rooted through the forest understory, which dodos lived in; pigs, macaques, and rats preyed
on dodo eggs and chicks; and all of them competed with dodos
for resources. Dodos were last seen less than a century
after Dutch arrival. At the time, people didn't recognize
that species could disappear. It wasn't until a century later,
in the 1790s, that a scientist conclusively demonstrated
the concept of extinction. By then, many thought dodos were fake. But discoveries from digs and sparse
remains helped confirm their existence. Nevertheless, representations of dodos
were misleading. One popular natural history text
of the late 1700s characterized them as stupid,
voracious, and grotesque. Once Lewis Carroll included a dodo in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
in 1865, the birds quickly amassed popularity. But dodos continued being framed as inept,
clumsy, lazy, and unfit for survival in scholarly works, satirical magazines,
and children's poems alike. And yet, there's no evidence that dodos
were less intelligent than their relatives. The dodo's brain size relative to its body
was similar to that of other pigeons. And especially rotund dodo depictions
are misleading. They may have been inspired by what dodos
looked like during mating displays or in captivity— or they were just
poor artistic renderings. Scientists think dodos were
fairly muscular birds. All in all, the dodo was, in fact,
a survivor that withstood major natural disasters
and thrived on its island home. It simply wasn't prepared for a sudden
onslaught of invasive species. And neither were other
endemic Mauritian animals, including raven parrots, fruit bats,
and giant tortoises. In the aftermath, perhaps it was easier
to declare the dodo's extinction the result of its personal failing
than to admit it was a human one.

**Transcript**:
Dodos are commonly considered
brainless, blundering birds that were poorly adapted
and doomed to die off, making their human-mediated extinction
effortless and inevitable. But that's not the case. So, what were dodos actually like?
And what really caused their downfall? Let's start at their origin. Okay, rewinding more than
20 million years, some tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia
voyaged across the Indian Ocean, perhaps by gradually journeying
from island to island. Eventually, their descendants came to a
remote archipelago east of Madagascar. Those that settled likely
diversified over time. Then, about 8 million years ago, an underwater volcano formed another
island on the chain, which would come to be known as Mauritius. Some of the birds populated
this new island, too, and down the line,
dodos emerged as a distinct species. They shared Mauritius with bats, lizards,
giant tortoises, and other birds. The closest large predators were held
back by about 800 kilometers of ocean, so getting murdered was basically
a non-issue. Without the need for defensive
adaptations, like flight, expending energy on them
would have been wasteful. So, as with the kākāpōs of New Zealand
and the cormorants of the Galápagos, their flight muscles shrank. Dodos probably nested
on the island's forest floor, feasting on fruits and seeds. Reaching just under a meter tall, they were among the island's
largest animals. And they were well-adapted
to their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry
and wet conditions. They also survived some major disruptions. Around 4,300 years ago, a megadrought caused waves
of mass mortality events on Mauritius. Fresh water grew scarce
and lakes likely grew saltier and became treacherous traps. This lasted for around 150 years. However, dodos prevailed...
until a few millennia later, when everything changed— quickly. In 1598, Dutch sailors came
ashore on Mauritius, and the island soon became
a welcome stopover for their trade ships. The sailors described natural wonders, including large numbers of birds
twice as big as swans and tortoises with shells huge enough
to fit 10 men. Mauritian animals hadn't evolved
to fear being hunted by humans, so they were an easy catch. Sailors ate some dodos,
but this alone didn't cause their doom. The Dutch sailors came with company. They brought macaques
that were probably pets. They released goats and pigs
on the island to establish food sources. And at some point, sailors also
inadvertently introduced rats. It's thought that goats and pigs grazed
and rooted through the forest understory, which dodos lived in; pigs, macaques, and rats preyed
on dodo eggs and chicks; and all of them competed with dodos
for resources. Dodos were last seen less than a century
after Dutch arrival. At the time, people didn't recognize
that species could disappear. It wasn't until a century later,
in the 1790s, that a scientist conclusively demonstrated
the concept of extinction. By then, many thought dodos were fake. But discoveries from digs and sparse
remains helped confirm their existence. Nevertheless, representations of dodos
were misleading. One popular natural history text
of the late 1700s characterized them as stupid,
voracious, and grotesque. Once Lewis Carroll included a dodo in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
in 1865, the birds quickly amassed popularity. But dodos continued being framed as inept,
clumsy, lazy, and unfit for survival in scholarly works, satirical magazines,
and children's poems alike. And yet, there's no evidence that dodos
were less intelligent than their relatives. The dodo's brain size relative to its body
was similar to that of other pigeons. And especially rotund dodo depictions
are misleading. They may have been inspired by what dodos
looked like during mating displays or in captivity— or they were just
poor artistic renderings. Scientists think dodos were
fairly muscular birds. All in all, the dodo was, in fact,
a survivor that withstood major natural disasters
and thrived on its island home. It simply wasn't prepared for a sudden
onslaught of invasive species. And neither were other
endemic Mauritian animals, including raven parrots, fruit bats,
and giant tortoises. In the aftermath, perhaps it was easier
to declare the dodo's extinction the result of its personal failing
than to admit it was a human one.

**Transcript**:
You might not guess it,
but this Alcon blue butterfly is a parasite whose offspring
will live highly unusual lives. She lays pinhead-sized eggs
on a wildflower and is off. The first tiny caterpillar
hatches a few days later. After two weeks living
within a flower bud, he embarks on a high-risk operation
that will require infiltrating a densely guarded fortress undercover. He secretes a thread of silk
and descends to the ground. Here, he's more vulnerable than ever,
but he holds still and waits. His descent perfectly coincides
with the peak foraging hours of the nearby red ant colony. Soon enough, a worker ant
encounters the caterpillar. She inspects his cuticle
with her sensitive antennae and picks up on key chemical cues
that she uses to recognize her kin. This is all part of the
caterpillar's disguise. The worker picks him up
and reverses course. Indeed, the caterpillar doesn't battle
his way into the fortress. No— he wouldn't stand a chance. He's shepherded in because the ant is treating him like one
of her colony's own larvae. They pass legions of ants
poised to attack invaders and enter the intricately architected,
subterranean nest, which is sheltered, moist,
and stockpiled with resources. If the caterpillar's mimicry didn't work, he might have been left for dead
or taken as food himself. Instead, the ant places the caterpillar
in the nursery, among the colony's own cherished brood. Here, he produces sugary secretions
that the worker ants feed from. The nurse ants dote upon him, regurgitating food
into his mouth frequently. But he has a voracious appetite. He arches his body in a begging
posture to obtain more food, and, every now and then,
eats one of his own nestmates. The caterpillar also does things
that the ant larvae can't: he makes noises that sound a lot
like those emitted by the ant queens. In effect, he signals that he's royalty
and should be prioritized over the actual ant larvae. And that's exactly what happens. The nurse ants feed him extra. And when a wild boar causes part
of the nest to collapse, the ants rescue the caterpillar first. While members of the ant colony suffer
reduced survival rates because of the burdensome caterpillar, he passes the harsh winter
living like royalty. Come June, he's stored up plenty
of nutrients to make a dramatic transformation. He forms his chrysalis,
and for three weeks, he uses a tooth-and-comb organ to create
more queen-like acoustic vibrations, attracting workers to clean him. Then, at dawn one day,
he emerges an adult butterfly. Wings still wet, his body easily fits
through the gallery opening, and finally,
11 months after being taken in, he basks in the sun
and begins searching for a mate. When he dies about a week later, he'll have spent the vast majority
of his life in the realm of the ants. The Alcon blue is one of as many
as 200 parasitic butterfly species, all of which target ants. Sometimes, multiple caterpillars inhabit
the same ant colony at once. Some stay for almost two years. But researchers are still parsing
these complex relationships. For instance, certain ants guard Japanese
oakblue caterpillars from predators and consume the sugary secretions
the caterpillars produce in return. But it turns out that this
sweet concoction isn't a simple form of mutual assistance. Instead, chemicals in the secretions
actually manipulate the ants' behavior, inhibiting their movement and making them more protective
and aggressive caterpillar guards. Despite these masterful manipulations, parasitic butterflies are
vulnerable themselves. They're also the targets of parasitism. Even within their adopted,
high-security hideaways, parasitoid wasps sometimes track
the caterpillars down and lay eggs on their bodies. When the wasp larvae hatch,
they consume the caterpillars alive. And because their life cycles consist
of such a complex choreography involving specific plants and ants, small environmental changes can
affect their populations. One parasitic butterfly species actually
went extinct in the UK in 1979, before being reintroduced
a few years later. They've since rebounded alongside
efforts to restore the meadow habitats their host ants require to thrive— helping preserve these
riveting relationships and the astonishing adaptations
they inspire.

subterranean nest, which is sheltered, moist,
and stockpiled with resources. If the caterpillar's mimicry didn't work, he might have been left for dead
or taken as food himself. Instead, the ant places the caterpillar
in the nursery, among the colony's own cherished brood. Here, he produces sugary secretions
that the worker ants feed from. The nurse ants dote upon him, regurgitating food
into his mouth frequently. But he has a voracious appetite. He arches his body in a begging
posture to obtain more food, and, every now and then,
eats one of his own nestmates. The caterpillar also does things
that the ant larvae can't: he makes noises that sound a lot
like those emitted by the ant queens. In effect, he signals that he's royalty
and should be prioritized over the actual ant larvae. And that's exactly what happens. The nurse ants feed him extra. And when a wild boar causes part
of the nest to collapse, the ants rescue the caterpillar first. While members of the ant colony suffer
reduced survival rates because of the burdensome caterpillar, he passes the harsh winter
living like royalty. Come June, he's stored up plenty
of nutrients to make a dramatic transformation. He forms his chrysalis,
and for three weeks, he uses a tooth-and-comb organ to create
more queen-like acoustic vibrations, attracting workers to clean him. Then, at dawn one day,
he emerges an adult butterfly. Wings still wet, his body easily fits
through the gallery opening, and finally,
11 months after being taken in, he basks in the sun
and begins searching for a mate. When he dies about a week later, he'll have spent the vast majority
of his life in the realm of the ants. The Alcon blue is one of as many
as 200 parasitic butterfly species, all of which target ants. Sometimes, multiple caterpillars inhabit
the same ant colony at once. Some stay for almost two years. But researchers are still parsing
these complex relationships. For instance, certain ants guard Japanese
oakblue caterpillars from predators and consume the sugary secretions
the caterpillars produce in return. But it turns out that this
sweet concoction isn't a simple form of mutual assistance. Instead, chemicals in the secretions
actually manipulate the ants' behavior, inhibiting their movement and making them more protective
and aggressive caterpillar guards. Despite these masterful manipulations, parasitic butterflies are
vulnerable themselves. They're also the targets of parasitism. Even within their adopted,
high-security hideaways, parasitoid wasps sometimes track
the caterpillars down and lay eggs on their bodies. When the wasp larvae hatch,
they consume the caterpillars alive. And because their life cycles consist
of such a complex choreography involving specific plants and ants, small environmental changes can
affect their populations. One parasitic butterfly species actually
went extinct in the UK in 1979, before being reintroduced
a few years later. They've since rebounded alongside
efforts to restore the meadow habitats their host ants require to thrive— helping preserve these
riveting relationships and the astonishing adaptations
they inspire.

**Transcript**:
You might not guess it,
but this Alcon blue butterfly is a parasite whose offspring
will live highly unusual lives. She lays pinhead-sized eggs
on a wildflower and is off. The first tiny caterpillar
hatches a few days later. After two weeks living
within a flower bud, he embarks on a high-risk operation
that will require infiltrating a densely guarded fortress undercover. He secretes a thread of silk
and descends to the ground. Here, he's more vulnerable than ever,
but he holds still and waits. His descent perfectly coincides
with the peak foraging hours of the nearby red ant colony. Soon enough, a worker ant
encounters the caterpillar. She inspects his cuticle
with her sensitive antennae and picks up on key chemical cues
that she uses to recognize her kin. This is all part of the
caterpillar's disguise. The worker picks him up
and reverses course. Indeed, the caterpillar doesn't battle
his way into the fortress. No— he wouldn't stand a chance. He's shepherded in because the ant is treating him like one
of her colony's own larvae. They pass legions of ants
poised to attack invaders and enter the intricately architected,
subterranean nest, which is sheltered, moist,
and stockpiled with resources. If the caterpillar's mimicry didn't work, he might have been left for dead
or taken as food himself. Instead, the ant places the caterpillar
in the nursery, among the colony's own cherished brood. Here, he produces sugary secretions
that the worker ants feed from. The nurse ants dote upon him, regurgitating food

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about classifying the Alcon blue butterfly, and the correct option is "An endangered species." While none of the generated MCQs ask about classification, Question 8 mentions the extinction of a parasitic butterfly species in the UK, which is related to the concept of endangered species.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ is Question 7, which asks about threats to the survival of parasitic butterflies. This question is related to the concept of endangered species, as it discusses the vulnerabilities of parasitic butterflies.

Therefore, I would suggest that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
In the kitchen at a friend's party, you're in the midst of a profound
moral conundrum. Famous philosophers whisper
advice in your ear. Utilitarian John Stuart Mill tells you
that one should always strive to bring about the greatest happiness
for the greatest number of people. Aristotle reminds you of the importance
of the virtues of generosity and justice. But Thomas Hobbes points out that "of all voluntary acts,
the object is to every man his own good." In other words, human beings
are inherently selfish anyway. So why shouldn't you take
the last cupcake for yourself? This is actually one of philosophy's
oldest questions. Not your cupcake dilemma— the question of whether or not
human beings are inherently selfish. The idea that humans only act
out of self-interest is known as psychological egoism, and there aren't many philosophers
who endorse this extreme stance. There's simply too much evidence
of humans sacrificing their self-interest, and sometimes their very lives,
for the sake of others. And studies by psychologists have shown
that even very young children demonstrate helpful behavior despite
there being nothing in it for themselves. However, the idea that all humans
have a deep selfish streak is something many more philosophers
would agree with. German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted
that while we often seem to act for the sake of others, it's impossible to be sure
we're not truly motivated by "a secret impulse of self-love." For example, maybe when people make
large donations to charity, they're actually more interested
in looking good or benefiting from tax breaks
than helping others. It's worth noting that not all 
philosophers think self-love is always a bad thing. French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
identified two kinds of self-love. He believed "Amour de soi,"
our basic need for self-preservation, is natural and essential. But he identified "amour propre," our toxic desire for recognition
and social status, as the cause of many unjust disparities. In a similar vein, Aristotle argued
that humans are social beings who can only flourish when we seek
the good of others as well as ourselves. By this logic, true self-love requires us
to work against our selfish tendencies. For many philosophers,
this is where the real problem lies— how do we overcome our selfishness? Some, like Kant, have argued
that our sense of moral duty is what helps us rise
above our narrow self-interest. Others, like Rousseau and Adam Smith, contend that emotions
like pity and sympathy are what allow us to consider
the needs of others. But 20th century philosopher-novelist
Iris Murdoch believed the only true solution
to human selfishness was love. Or at least,
a certain kind of love. For Murdoch, selfishness isn't about
trivial things like taking the last cupcake. It's about seeing the world in a way
that casts yourself as a star, and everyone else as secondary characters. To explain this, Murdoch tells the story
of a discontented mother-in-law. While the mother is always polite, she secretly feels her son made
a mistake marrying his "vulgar" and "tiresomely juvenile" wife. To Murdoch, this mother
is the picture of selfishness. By centering her own jealousy
and insecurity, she's reducing the nuanced reality
of her daughter-in-law to a caricature. But with some conscious effort, Murdoch believes the mother can learn to
see her daughter in law as she truly is— not vulgar or juvenile, but refreshingly straightforward
and delightfully youthful. To be clear, this doesn't mean the mother should simply don
rose-colored glasses. Love, as Murdoch defines it,
is "the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself
is real." As challenging as this might be, Murdoch believes we can all reach
this realization by cultivating what she calls attention. Partially inspired by Buddhist meditation, this practice could include engaging
with art, learning foreign languages, or simply taking the time to observe
the natural environment. What's important for Murdoch
is that the behavior helps direct your attention
beyond the self. Because only by practicing our ability
to attend to the world around us can we learn to see it as it truly is.

the object is to every man his own good." In other words, human beings
are inherently selfish anyway. So why shouldn't you take
the last cupcake for yourself? This is actually one of philosophy's
oldest questions. Not your cupcake dilemma— the question of whether or not
human beings are inherently selfish. The idea that humans only act
out of self-interest is known as psychological egoism, and there aren't many philosophers
who endorse this extreme stance. There's simply too much evidence
of humans sacrificing their self-interest, and sometimes their very lives,
for the sake of others. And studies by psychologists have shown
that even very young children demonstrate helpful behavior despite
there being nothing in it for themselves. However, the idea that all humans
have a deep selfish streak is something many more philosophers
would agree with. German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted
that while we often seem to act for the sake of others, it's impossible to be sure
we're not truly motivated by "a secret impulse of self-love." For example, maybe when people make
large donations to charity, they're actually more interested
in looking good or benefiting from tax breaks
than helping others. It's worth noting that not all 
philosophers think self-love is always a bad thing. French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
identified two kinds of self-love. He believed "Amour de soi,"
our basic need for self-preservation, is natural and essential. But he identified "amour propre," our toxic desire for recognition
and social status, as the cause of many unjust disparities. In a similar vein, Aristotle argued
that humans are social beings who can only flourish when we seek
the good of others as well as ourselves. By this logic, true self-love requires us
to work against our selfish tendencies. For many philosophers,
this is where the real problem lies— how do we overcome our selfishness? Some, like Kant, have argued
that our sense of moral duty is what helps us rise
above our narrow self-interest. Others, like Rousseau and Adam Smith, contend that emotions
like pity and sympathy are what allow us to consider
the needs of others. But 20th century philosopher-novelist
Iris Murdoch believed the only true solution
to human selfishness was love. Or at least,
a certain kind of love. For Murdoch, selfishness isn't about
trivial things like taking the last cupcake. It's about seeing the world in a way
that casts yourself as a star, and everyone else as secondary characters. To explain this, Murdoch tells the story
of a discontented mother-in-law. While the mother is always polite, she secretly feels her son made
a mistake marrying his "vulgar" and "tiresomely juvenile" wife. To Murdoch, this mother
is the picture of selfishness. By centering her own jealousy
and insecurity, she's reducing the nuanced reality
of her daughter-in-law to a caricature. But with some conscious effort, Murdoch believes the mother can learn to
see her daughter in law as she truly is— not vulgar or juvenile, but refreshingly straightforward
and delightfully youthful. To be clear, this doesn't mean the mother should simply don
rose-colored glasses. Love, as Murdoch defines it,
is "the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself
is real." As challenging as this might be, Murdoch believes we can all reach
this realization by cultivating what she calls attention. Partially inspired by Buddhist meditation, this practice could include engaging
with art, learning foreign languages, or simply taking the time to observe
the natural environment. What's important for Murdoch
is that the behavior helps direct your attention
beyond the self. Because only by practicing our ability
to attend to the world around us can we learn to see it as it truly is.

In the kitchen at a friend's party, you're in the midst of a profound
moral conundrum. Famous philosophers whisper

**Transcript**:
Pharaoh Ramesses II reigned
for almost 70 years in the 13th century BCE. He presided over a golden age
of Egyptian prosperity. But was he a model leader, or a shameless egomaniac
and master of propaganda? Order! Order! Who do we have on the stand?
Ramesses II? Ahem, I believe you mean
"The strong bull, protector of Egypt, who subdues foreign lands; rich in years, great in victories,
chosen by Ra— whose justice is powerful— Ramesses, beloved of Amun." But you may refer to him
as Ramesses the Great. Ramesses, Ramesses— 
I think I've heard of him. "Let my people go!" Yes, Your Honor, he was the infamously
stubborn pharaoh of Exodus, who forced enslaved Hebrews to build out his extravagant capital city
of Pi-Ramesses. Objection, there's no
archaeological evidence that Ramesses used forced labor
in his construction projects. Egyptians relied on highly trained
artisans and craftsmen to build their cities and monuments. And menial labor,
like quarrying and moving stones, was done by military soldiers
and foreign mercenaries— all of whom were compensated
for their work. So he's not the pharaoh from Exodus? It's hard to say for certain. According to some timelines, Ramesses is the best candidate
for that particular pharaoh. But there's no evidence of any Hebrew
population in Egypt during his reign, and certainly no records of a revolution
or mass migration like the one described in Exodus. Is that really so surprising? It's not like Ramesses kept records
of any other time he was defeated. What do you mean? Our "great" pharaoh here operated
one of the largest propaganda machines in ancient history. Almost all pharaohs relied on propaganda
to control their country, and Ramesses had particularly
big sandals to fill. His father, Seti I, led Egypt to a period
of great wealth and stability that Ramesses worked hard to maintain. Through propaganda, yes,
but also military glory. More like military aggression. By the end of Seti's reign, he had established peace
with the neighboring Hittites by guaranteeing Egyptian control
over a sought-after region called Kadesh. But in the fifth year of his reign,
Ramesses broke those agreements. It wasn't the most peaceful decision, but Ramesses believed a military victory
would aid his efforts to restore Egypt's reputation. And he was right! His victory over the Hittites
cemented Ramesses' persona as a heroic pharaoh of old. Yeah, except he didn't even win! His supposed victory was
actually a stalemate in which the pharaoh's arrogance
almost cost Egypt the entire war. When two Hittite spies told Ramesses
the enemy had fled in fear, he let his guard down,
allowing his men to be ambushed. He played right into the Hittite's trap
and almost lost everything. Yet the official story Ramesses
had chiseled across Egypt cast himself as the battle's
greatest hero. Military achievements were important
for legitimizing a pharaoh's power, even if that meant a bit
of exaggeration. A bit? You can't trust
anything this guy says! If it wasn't for the Hittite's
conflicting record, we'd still be buying Ramesses' propaganda. I propose that this court cannot judge
any historical figure's legacy by the stories they tell about themselves. That seems reasonable to me. Fair enough. How's this record then— the first recorded peace treaty
in archaeological history signed by Ramesses and the Hittites. "Peace treaty" is pretty generous. Ramesses begrudgingly agreed
to a mutual defense contract, where Egyptians and Hittites would work
together if attacked by an external enemy. And what's wrong with that? This peaceful end to the conflict
marked the beginning of Ramesses' prosperous reign— a golden age of Egyptian power and wealth. True, but we have no idea if this wealth
trickled down to everyday Egyptians or just financed Ramesses' vain attempts
to achieve immortality through stone. He spent his entire reign pouring
money into ego projects. And one of the most famous,
Abu Simbel, wasn't even in Egypt! Abu Simbel was in Nubia to showcase
Egypt's strength and discourage a Nubian revolution. Besides, pharaohs were expected to invest
in building projects for the gods. Right, "for the gods,"
which Ramesses was not. Pharaohs typically occupied a status
between gods and mortals, but the location of Ramesses' statue
inside Abu Simbel positions him as their supposed equal. He even tore down existing temples
to reuse their bricks in monuments to himself! He tore down temples built by Akhenaten, a pharaoh who'd attempted
to impose monotheism. By destroying those temples, Ramesses reinforced his commitment
to Egypt's traditional religion. That doesn't account for why he frequently
erased other pharaohs' names on monuments and replaced them with his own. Hey, what the...? Even pharaohs who had short reigns
had numerous statues made of themselves— and Ramesses ruled
for almost seven decades. Well, he definitely made
a lasting impression. Let's face it, Your Honor, would we even
be talking about him today if he hadn't? It's often said that history is written
by the winners, but in this courtroom, a winning record never guarantees
the outcome.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ.

Although Question 2 does not ask about the capital city of Ramesses II, it does relate to his construction projects, which is mentioned in the context of the capital city in the transcript.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the capital city, but since that is not available, I would choose Question 2 as the most similar.

However, if I had to choose a question that has a location as an answer, I would choose Question 1, but it's still not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. 

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: What was the name of Ramesses II's capital city?
Options: A. Pi-Ramesses, B. Thebes, C. Memphis, D. Cairo
Correct Option: A

This new generated MCQ directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options.

**Transcript**:
Pharaoh Ramesses II reigned
for almost 70 years in the 13th century BCE. He presided over a golden age
of Egyptian prosperity. But was he a model leader, or a shameless egomaniac
and master of propaganda? Order! Order! Who do we have on the stand?
Ramesses II? Ahem, I believe you mean
"The strong bull, protector of Egypt, who subdues foreign lands; rich in years, great in victories,
chosen by Ra— whose justice is powerful— Ramesses, beloved of Amun." But you may refer to him
as Ramesses the Great. Ramesses, Ramesses— 
I think I've heard of him. "Let my people go!" Yes, Your Honor, he was the infamously
stubborn pharaoh of Exodus, who forced enslaved Hebrews to build out his extravagant capital city
of Pi-Ramesses. Objection, there's no
archaeological evidence that Ramesses used forced labor
in his construction projects. Egyptians relied on highly trained
artisans and craftsmen to build their cities and monuments. And menial labor,
like quarrying and moving stones, was done by military soldiers
and foreign mercenaries— all of whom were compensated
for their work. So he's not the pharaoh from Exodus? It's hard to say for certain. According to some timelines, Ramesses is the best candidate
for that particular pharaoh. But there's no evidence of any Hebrew
population in Egypt during his reign, and certainly no records of a revolution
or mass migration like the one described in Exodus. Is that really so surprising? It's not like Ramesses kept records
of any other time he was defeated. What do you mean? Our "great" pharaoh here operated
one of the largest propaganda machines in ancient history. Almost all pharaohs relied on propaganda
to control their country, and Ramesses had particularly
big sandals to fill. His father, Seti I, led Egypt to a period
of great wealth and stability that Ramesses worked hard to maintain. Through propaganda, yes,
but also military glory. More like military aggression. By the end of Seti's reign, he had established peace
with the neighboring Hittites by guaranteeing Egyptian control
over a sought-after region called Kadesh. But in the fifth year of his reign,
Ramesses broke those agreements. It wasn't the most peaceful decision, but Ramesses believed a military victory
would aid his efforts to restore Egypt's reputation. And he was right! His victory over the Hittites
cemented Ramesses' persona as a heroic pharaoh of old. Yeah, except he didn't even win! His supposed victory was
actually a stalemate in which the pharaoh's arrogance
almost cost Egypt the entire war. When two Hittite spies told Ramesses
the enemy had fled in fear, he let his guard down,
allowing his men to be ambushed. He played right into the Hittite's trap
and almost lost everything. Yet the official story Ramesses
had chiseled across Egypt cast himself as the battle's
greatest hero. Military achievements were important
for legitimizing a pharaoh's power, even if that meant a bit
of exaggeration. A bit? You can't trust
anything this guy says! If it wasn't for the Hittite's
conflicting record, we'd still be buying Ramesses' propaganda. I propose that this court cannot judge
any historical figure's legacy by the stories they tell about themselves. That seems reasonable to me. Fair enough. How's this record then— the first recorded peace treaty
in archaeological history signed by Ramesses and the Hittites. "Peace treaty" is pretty generous. Ramesses begrudgingly agreed
to a mutual defense contract, where Egyptians and Hittites would work
together if attacked by an external enemy. And what's wrong with that? This peaceful end to the conflict
marked the beginning of Ramesses' prosperous reign— a golden age of Egyptian power and wealth. True, but we have no idea if this wealth
trickled down to everyday Egyptians or just financed Ramesses' vain attempts
to achieve immortality through stone. He spent his entire reign pouring
money into ego projects. And one of the most famous,
Abu Simbel, wasn't even in Egypt! Abu Simbel was in Nubia to showcase
Egypt's strength and discourage a Nubian revolution. Besides, pharaohs were expected to invest
in building projects for the gods. Right, "for the gods,"
which Ramesses was not. Pharaohs typically occupied a status
between gods and mortals, but the location of Ramesses' statue
inside Abu Simbel positions him as their supposed equal. He even tore down existing temples
to reuse their bricks in monuments to himself! He tore down temples built by Akhenaten, a pharaoh who'd attempted
to impose monotheism. By destroying those temples, Ramesses reinforced his commitment
to Egypt's traditional religion. That doesn't account for why he frequently
erased other pharaohs' names on monuments and replaced them with his own. Hey, what the...? Even pharaohs who had short reigns
had numerous statues made of themselves— and Ramesses ruled
for almost seven decades. Well, he definitely made
a lasting impression. Let's face it, Your Honor, would we even
be talking about him today if he hadn't? It's often said that history is written
by the winners, but in this courtroom, a winning record never guarantees
the outcome.

top-ranked financial analyst to the world’s movers and shakers, its literal titans of industry. He handles all divine assets. When it comes to boiling complex systems
of intrinsic value down to monetary sums, he’s the guy. And he’s actually got a potential buyer: Hades is interested in building
his real estate portfolio and expanding his domain
into the marine realm. So, the accountant already appraised
the ocean’s market value and prepared a quick presentation. "The property covers
over 70% of Earth’s surface. But it’s also quite voluminous!" Poseidon knows this. He does annual Mariana Trench
swims with sea cucumbers. But before he even gets
to his best giant squid story, the accountant is back at analysis. "Marine shipping alone accounts
for 80% of global trade, generating over $14 trillion annually. The global fishing industry 
provides over 3 billion people with a significant amount 
of their dietary protein, employs an estimated 260 million, and generates about $163 billion
every year. And oil and budding
seabed mining industries generate around $245 billion per year." "Some of the ocean’s assets
are harder to quantify monetarily. The ocean absorbs around 30%
of human generated carbon dioxide, and, since 1955, has taken
in more than 90% of excess heat. About 40% of humanity lives
within 100 kilometers of the ocean. Coastal ecosystems buffer waves,
reduce erosion, and ease flooding, preventing over $716 billion
in damages annually. Many cultures have deep ties to the ocean. And coastal views and recreation
improve mental health. Meanwhile, it's estimated
that as-yet undiscovered marine-derived cancer treatments
could save countless lives and be worth up to $5.7 trillion. The ocean generates half
the planet’s oxygen and, directly or indirectly, provides food, energy, and minerals
to all life on Earth." A salty tear cascades down Poseidon’s face
that the accountant ignores. He can’t give the total cost yet
because, of course, recent developments must be factored in. "Climate change is heating, acidifying,
and deoxygenating the ocean and trash is polluting it. Overfishing and aggressive 
seabed resource extraction are disrupting fragile ecosystems
and impacting the ocean’s productivity." The accountant says, "Sigh, buddy,
you shouldn’t worry, though, because we can grow
the ocean’s investment value. Coral reef tourism already yields
approximately $36 billion annually. Considering the revenue
of popular dive sites and their regional shark
populations and lifespans, researchers estimate that one shark can
generate almost $2 million in its lifetime— making them much more valuable
alive than dead. Sustainable management of fisheries
could allow species to rebound and bring in an additional
$83 billion annually. And with growth in offshore wind, 
tidal, and wave energy harvesting, the ocean is poised to help
humanity quit fossil fuels." Now the grand reveal. The accountant's conclusions are similar
to those of mortal experts: the ocean alone is worth
roughly $24 trillion— at least— about a quarter
of the World Bank’s valuation of the global economy in 2021. But if humanity reinvests
in the ocean's health— fishing sustainably,
decarbonizing shipping, scaling offshore wind farms,
and conserving and restoring mangroves— investments could return
up to 600% in profits. Poseidon feels the weight of his folly
crushing him like a Styrofoam cup 2,000 meters deep. Reducing such a priceless, generously
life-giving natural system to a number is just another symptom of the greatest

A closer match would be a question that asks about a specific percentage or fact related to the ocean's role in the ecosystem. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in intent and content, I would suggest Question 4, which discusses the decline in the ocean's productivity due to various factors, including climate change. While it does not specifically ask about the percentage of carbon dioxide absorbed or excess heat taken in, it does relate to the ocean's role in the ecosystem and the impact of human activities on the ocean.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 4 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
Surveying his vast domain, 
trident heavy in hand, Poseidon considers 
the prospect of retirement. What if someone else donned
the coral crown so he could spend his immortality
harmonizing with blue whales and cozying up to hydrothermal vents? Poseidon decides he needs to actually
prioritize himself for once. So he summons his accountant and asks: how much could he sell
the ocean for today? Poseidon’s accountant is the
top-ranked financial analyst to the world’s movers and shakers, its literal titans of industry. He handles all divine assets. When it comes to boiling complex systems
of intrinsic value down to monetary sums, he’s the guy. And he’s actually got a potential buyer: Hades is interested in building
his real estate portfolio and expanding his domain
into the marine realm. So, the accountant already appraised
the ocean’s market value and prepared a quick presentation. "The property covers
over 70% of Earth’s surface. But it’s also quite voluminous!" Poseidon knows this. He does annual Mariana Trench
swims with sea cucumbers. But before he even gets
to his best giant squid story, the accountant is back at analysis. "Marine shipping alone accounts
for 80% of global trade, generating over $14 trillion annually. The global fishing industry 
provides over 3 billion people with a significant amount 
of their dietary protein, employs an estimated 260 million, and generates about $163 billion
every year. And oil and budding
seabed mining industries generate around $245 billion per year." "Some of the ocean’s assets
are harder to quantify monetarily. The ocean absorbs around 30%
of human generated carbon dioxide, and, since 1955, has taken
in more than 90% of excess heat. About 40% of humanity lives
within 100 kilometers of the ocean. Coastal ecosystems buffer waves,
reduce erosion, and ease flooding, preventing over $716 billion
in damages annually. Many cultures have deep ties to the ocean. And coastal views and recreation
improve mental health. Meanwhile, it's estimated
that as-yet undiscovered marine-derived cancer treatments
could save countless lives and be worth up to $5.7 trillion. The ocean generates half
the planet’s oxygen and, directly or indirectly, provides food, energy, and minerals
to all life on Earth." A salty tear cascades down Poseidon’s face
that the accountant ignores. He can’t give the total cost yet
because, of course, recent developments must be factored in. "Climate change is heating, acidifying,
and deoxygenating the ocean and trash is polluting it. Overfishing and aggressive 
seabed resource extraction are disrupting fragile ecosystems
and impacting the ocean’s productivity." The accountant says, "Sigh, buddy,
you shouldn’t worry, though, because we can grow
the ocean’s investment value. Coral reef tourism already yields
approximately $36 billion annually. Considering the revenue
of popular dive sites and their regional shark
populations and lifespans, researchers estimate that one shark can
generate almost $2 million in its lifetime— making them much more valuable
alive than dead. Sustainable management of fisheries
could allow species to rebound and bring in an additional
$83 billion annually. And with growth in offshore wind, 
tidal, and wave energy harvesting, the ocean is poised to help
humanity quit fossil fuels." Now the grand reveal. The accountant's conclusions are similar
to those of mortal experts: the ocean alone is worth
roughly $24 trillion— at least— about a quarter
of the World Bank’s valuation of the global economy in 2021. But if humanity reinvests
in the ocean's health— fishing sustainably,
decarbonizing shipping, scaling offshore wind farms,
and conserving and restoring mangroves— investments could return
up to 600% in profits. Poseidon feels the weight of his folly
crushing him like a Styrofoam cup 2,000 meters deep. Reducing such a priceless, generously
life-giving natural system to a number is just another symptom of the greatest
problems he’s facing nowadays. And though he respects the work
his brother, Hades, does, he doesn't want the ocean to become
an extension of the Underworld. He can’t give it up. Poseidon asks forgiveness and reaffirms his eternal vow
to protect the ocean. It’ll take him a few tidal cycles
to realize Hades and the accountant were bluffing 
and see what this really was: a much-needed intervention by a duo
of deities who cared deeply about him— and the world.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of oxygen supplied by the ocean, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to the ocean's value, revenue, and productivity.

Although there isn't a direct match, I recommend Generated MCQ 1 as the most similar, as it also deals with a percentage-related question about the ocean (the percentage of Earth's surface covered by the ocean). However, please note that this is a weak similarity, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the ocean's oxygen supply.

If I had to choose, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

However, I would like to emphasize that this is not a strong match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the ocean's oxygen supply.

**Transcript**:
If you were to place all the rice consumed
each year on one side of a scale, and every person in the world
on the other, the scale would tip heavily
towards rice's favor. This beloved crop contributes over 20% of
the calories consumed by humans each year. Korean bibimbap, Nigerian jollof,
Indian biryani, Spanish paella, and countless other culinary masterpieces
all begin with rice. So how did this humble grain
end up in so many cuisines? The roots of rice go back thousands
of years to when early farmers in Asia, Africa, and South America
each independently domesticated the crop. First came Asian rice, which many plant geneticists believe
originated in what's now China. Over 10,000 years ago,
nomadic hunters in the region began gathering and eating seeds
from a weedy grass. Then, around 9,000 years ago,
they started planting these seeds, prompting nomadic hunters to settle
into farming communities. With each harvest, growers selected
and replanted seeds from the rice plants
that pleased them most— like those with bigger and more plentiful
grains or aromatic flavors. Over millennia, thousands of varieties
of Asian rice emerged. A relative of the same weedy grass
was also domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago. Today, its growth is mostly limited
to West Africa. South American growers also domesticated
rice around 4,000 years ago, though the crop was lost
after the arrival of Europeans. Asian rice, however, spread widely, and is now a cornerstone of diet
and culture in Asia and beyond. In India and Nepal, many Hindus mark
an infant's transition to solid foods with a ceremony known as Annaprashan, where the baby tastes rice
for the first time. in Japan, rice is so central to diets
that the word "gohan" means both "cooked rice" and "meal." The global expansion of rice cultivation
was only possible because the plant can grow
in many climates— from tropical to temperate. As a semi-aquatic plant, rice happily
grows in submerged soils. Many other crops can't survive
in standing water because their root cells rely on air
within soil to access oxygen. But rice plants have air channels
in their roots that allow oxygen to travel from the leaves and stems
to the submerged tissues. Traditionally, growers plant
rice in paddy fields— flat land submerged under as much
as 10 centimeters of water throughout the growing season. This practice returns high yields
since many competing weeds can't hack it in the aquatic environment. But the technique is also water intensive. Rice covers 11% of global cropland, but uses over a third
of the world's irrigation water. This form of rice production
also pumps out a surprising amount
of greenhouse gas emissions. Flooded fields are the perfect breeding
grounds for microorganisms known as methanogens. These microscopic lifeforms thrive
in environments lacking oxygen, because they evolved when the Earth
contained little of this gas. Methanogens are the only organisms
known to produce methane— a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent
than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Cows, for example, are infamous
for burping out methane due to methanogens in their stomachs. In a flooded paddy field, methanogens set
to work eating away at organic material in the submerged soil
and multiplying rapidly, all the while releasing copious amounts
of methane. The result: rice cultivation
contributes around 12% of human-caused methane
emissions each year. But there's good news. Rice doesn't actually need to grow
in continuously flooded paddies. Researchers and growers are exploring
water management strategies that can cut the methane
while keeping the yield. One promising technique is known
as alternate wetting and drying. Growers periodically let
the water level drop, which keeps methanogen growth in check. Alternate wetting and drying
can cut water use by 30% and methane emissions
by 30 to 70% without impacting yield. Greenhouse gases come from many—
sometimes unexpected— places. Making rice growing more sustainable
is just one of the many challenges we'll need to face
to avoid catastrophic warming. Today, many rice growers still
flood fields all season long. Changing millennia-old practices
requires a major mindset shift. But going against the grain could be
just what we need to keep our planet healthy
and our bowls full.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but I must emphasize that it is not a good match.

If I really had to choose, I would say:
The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

However, I would like to note that it would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ, rather than trying to find a similar one from the existing generated MCQs.

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: What percentage of global cropland is covered by rice cultivation?
Options: A. 11%, B. 21%, C. 14%, D. 44%
Correct Option: A

This new generated MCQ exactly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
If you were to place all the rice consumed
each year on one side of a scale, and every person in the world
on the other, the scale would tip heavily
towards rice's favor. This beloved crop contributes over 20% of
the calories consumed by humans each year. Korean bibimbap, Nigerian jollof,
Indian biryani, Spanish paella, and countless other culinary masterpieces
all begin with rice. So how did this humble grain
end up in so many cuisines? The roots of rice go back thousands
of years to when early farmers in Asia, Africa, and South America
each independently domesticated the crop. First came Asian rice, which many plant geneticists believe
originated in what's now China. Over 10,000 years ago,
nomadic hunters in the region began gathering and eating seeds
from a weedy grass. Then, around 9,000 years ago,
they started planting these seeds, prompting nomadic hunters to settle
into farming communities. With each harvest, growers selected
and replanted seeds from the rice plants
that pleased them most— like those with bigger and more plentiful
grains or aromatic flavors. Over millennia, thousands of varieties
of Asian rice emerged. A relative of the same weedy grass
was also domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago. Today, its growth is mostly limited
to West Africa. South American growers also domesticated
rice around 4,000 years ago, though the crop was lost
after the arrival of Europeans. Asian rice, however, spread widely, and is now a cornerstone of diet
and culture in Asia and beyond. In India and Nepal, many Hindus mark
an infant's transition to solid foods with a ceremony known as Annaprashan, where the baby tastes rice
for the first time. in Japan, rice is so central to diets
that the word "gohan" means both "cooked rice" and "meal." The global expansion of rice cultivation
was only possible because the plant can grow
in many climates— from tropical to temperate. As a semi-aquatic plant, rice happily
grows in submerged soils. Many other crops can't survive
in standing water because their root cells rely on air
within soil to access oxygen. But rice plants have air channels
in their roots that allow oxygen to travel from the leaves and stems
to the submerged tissues. Traditionally, growers plant
rice in paddy fields— flat land submerged under as much
as 10 centimeters of water throughout the growing season. This practice returns high yields
since many competing weeds can't hack it in the aquatic environment. But the technique is also water intensive. Rice covers 11% of global cropland, but uses over a third
of the world's irrigation water. This form of rice production
also pumps out a surprising amount
of greenhouse gas emissions. Flooded fields are the perfect breeding
grounds for microorganisms known as methanogens. These microscopic lifeforms thrive
in environments lacking oxygen, because they evolved when the Earth
contained little of this gas. Methanogens are the only organisms
known to produce methane— a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent
than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Cows, for example, are infamous
for burping out methane due to methanogens in their stomachs. In a flooded paddy field, methanogens set
to work eating away at organic material in the submerged soil
and multiplying rapidly, all the while releasing copious amounts
of methane. The result: rice cultivation
contributes around 12% of human-caused methane
emissions each year. But there's good news. Rice doesn't actually need to grow
in continuously flooded paddies. Researchers and growers are exploring
water management strategies that can cut the methane
while keeping the yield. One promising technique is known
as alternate wetting and drying. Growers periodically let
the water level drop, which keeps methanogen growth in check. Alternate wetting and drying
can cut water use by 30% and methane emissions
by 30 to 70% without impacting yield. Greenhouse gases come from many—
sometimes unexpected— places. Making rice growing more sustainable
is just one of the many challenges we'll need to face
to avoid catastrophic warming. Today, many rice growers still
flood fields all season long. Changing millennia-old practices
requires a major mindset shift. But going against the grain could be
just what we need to keep our planet healthy
and our bowls full.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1930s, a grand panda drama
unfolded at the Chicago Zoo. Su-Lin, who had been a media darling
since she was a cub, passed away. Zookeepers were already in the process of procuring another female panda
named Mei Mei, and they were determined to find her
a mate before tragedy struck again. So when they acquired a prospective suitor
named Mei Lan, it seemed their troubles were over. Magazines monitored their progress, and the public eagerly awaited
the patter of tiny panda paws. But the wait dragged on. At first, headlines declared that Mei Mei
was "getting nowhere" with her love life. But eventually zookeepers realized
their significant slip-up: both bears were male. This is just one of many mistakes humans
have made when it comes to pandas. We've incorrectly classified
them as raccoons, misrepresented them as cuddly vegetarians, and— since the doomed union
of Mei Mei and Mei Lan— declared them as incompetent lovers. Some people have taken this even further, suggesting it's remarkable
this sex-shy species has been able to sustain
themselves at all. However, this common perception of pandas
having low libidos actually has more to do
with human incompetence. When it comes to breeding pandas
in captivity, zookeepers face multiple challenges. As the Chicago case suggests, it can be
tricky to figure out a panda's sex. Their external genitals don't appear
until they're a few months old, and once visible, they look very similar. This forces zookeepers to rely
on inconsistent methods, like trying to measure the distance
between the anus and genitals, or simply going by feel. And even when males and females
are paired up correctly, chemistry isn't guaranteed. In one case at the Moscow Zoo, a female bear that had been isolated
from other animals proved more interested in zookeepers
than other pandas. Complicating things further, female pandas can only be impregnated
1 to 3 days each year due to their incredibly short
ovulation window. Zookeepers try to track fertility levels
by measuring the hormones in their urine, but this data is often cryptic to decipher
and messy to capture. Females have also evolved the ability
to reabsorb their own fetuses, meaning that even a successful
impregnation can be reversed. The difficulty of breeding pandas
has reinforced the idea that they're not naturally
inclined to procreate. But there's a huge gap between how these
animals behave in captivity and the privacy of the wild. Prowling through her home territory, a female panda rubs her anal glands
on tree trunks to attract mates, then waits in the treetops
bleating as loudly as she can. Soon enough, males crowd around the tree
and compete for her attention by seeing who can pee the highest. Suitors adopt a variety of poses
in these competitions, including the "squat," "legcock,"
and "handstand." They're also known to dab urine
behind their ears to broadcast their virility
through the breeze. Once a female picks a winner, the mating pair will often have sex
over 40 times in a single afternoon. At these rates, you might expect
panda populations to be booming, especially since panda sperm
is incredibly potent. But females' short ovulation cycles
and ability to reabsorb fetuses keep the population in check. In the wild, young pandas are usually able
to witness at least one breeding season before reaching sexual maturity, giving them time to learn
the rituals of seduction. But in captivity, pandas are never
able to learn these customs. And while breeders have tried to kick
start young pandas' sexual awakenings by showing them footage of mating elders
and offering them doses of Viagra, none of these strategies have
worked consistently. The most reliable approach they've
found is artificial insemination, which has dramatically increased
the captive population in the past few decades. But if pandas are so much better
at reproducing in the wild, one has to ask why are conservation
efforts so focused on breeding them. Maybe our time would be better spent protecting the pandas'
natural environments, giving them all the space they need
to get down to business.

In the late 1930s, a grand panda drama
unfolded at the Chicago Zoo. Su-Lin, who had been a media darling
since she was a cub, passed away. Zookeepers were already in the process of procuring another female panda
named Mei Mei, and they were determined to find her
a mate before tragedy struck again. So when they acquired a prospective suitor
named Mei Lan, it seemed their troubles were over. Magazines monitored their progress, and the public eagerly awaited
the patter of tiny panda paws. But the wait dragged on. At first, headlines declared that Mei Mei
was "getting nowhere" with her love life. But eventually zookeepers realized
their significant slip-up: both bears were male. This is just one of many mistakes humans
have made when it comes to pandas. We've incorrectly classified
them as raccoons, misrepresented them as cuddly vegetarians, and— since the doomed union
of Mei Mei and Mei Lan— declared them as incompetent lovers. Some people have taken this even further, suggesting it's remarkable
this sex-shy species has been able to sustain
themselves at all. However, this common perception of pandas
having low libidos actually has more to do
with human incompetence. When it comes to breeding pandas
in captivity, zookeepers face multiple challenges. As the Chicago case suggests, it can be
tricky to figure out a panda's sex. Their external genitals don't appear
until they're a few months old, and once visible, they look very similar. This forces zookeepers to rely
on inconsistent methods, like trying to measure the distance
between the anus and genitals, or simply going by feel. And even when males and females
are paired up correctly, chemistry isn't guaranteed. In one case at the Moscow Zoo, a female bear that had been isolated
from other animals proved more interested in zookeepers
than other pandas. Complicating things further, female pandas can only be impregnated
1 to 3 days each year due to their incredibly short
ovulation window. Zookeepers try to track fertility levels
by measuring the hormones in their urine, but this data is often cryptic to decipher
and messy to capture. Females have also evolved the ability
to reabsorb their own fetuses, meaning that even a successful
impregnation can be reversed. The difficulty of breeding pandas
has reinforced the idea that they're not naturally
inclined to procreate. But there's a huge gap between how these
animals behave in captivity and the privacy of the wild. Prowling through her home territory, a female panda rubs her anal glands
on tree trunks to attract mates, then waits in the treetops
bleating as loudly as she can. Soon enough, males crowd around the tree
and compete for her attention by seeing who can pee the highest. Suitors adopt a variety of poses
in these competitions, including the "squat," "legcock,"
and "handstand." They're also known to dab urine
behind their ears to broadcast their virility
through the breeze. Once a female picks a winner, the mating pair will often have sex
over 40 times in a single afternoon. At these rates, you might expect
panda populations to be booming, especially since panda sperm
is incredibly potent. But females' short ovulation cycles
and ability to reabsorb fetuses keep the population in check. In the wild, young pandas are usually able
to witness at least one breeding season before reaching sexual maturity, giving them time to learn
the rituals of seduction. But in captivity, pandas are never
able to learn these customs. And while breeders have tried to kick
start young pandas' sexual awakenings by showing them footage of mating elders
and offering them doses of Viagra, none of these strategies have
worked consistently. The most reliable approach they've
found is artificial insemination, which has dramatically increased
the captive population in the past few decades. But if pandas are so much better
at reproducing in the wild, one has to ask why are conservation
efforts so focused on breeding them. Maybe our time would be better spent protecting the pandas'
natural environments, giving them all the space they need
to get down to business.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the wording of the questions is different, the intent and content of Question 7 align with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about a common misconception about pandas, which is that they are not naturally inclined to procreate. Question 7 provides information that counters this misconception by explaining why panda populations are not booming despite the males' potent sperm, which is related to the females' short ovulation cycles and ability to reabsorb fetuses. This indirectly addresses the misconception that pandas are not naturally inclined to procreate.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 7, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. Today I’m going to teach you how to read. Which 
is something that you already know how to do,   obviously, but you probably have no 
idea how you’re actually doing it. But first I need to let you in on a secret: There’s a trick being played on 
you every time you read something. In fact it’s right in front of 
you right now. Do you see it? Let’s take a closer look at just a couple 
of letters and see if you can see it then.  Here’s just the C and T. These two 
letters are exactly the same weight,   or “size” in this typeface, so you’d 
figure they’re the exact same height.   But watch what happens when I lay them on top 
of each other. The C is ever-so-slightly taller. It’s true for other letter pairs 
too. Like E and S. The S is taller. It’s even true for other typefaces, like this one.  Letters that look the same size 
are actually… not the same size. And this… is on purpose. Because if they actually were the 
same size, mathematically speaking they wouldn’t look the same size. Letters with rounded tops have to be slightly 
taller than letters with flat tops in order for   them to appear the same size.
This illusion is hiding   in just about everything you’ve ever read.
Yes, it’s even in Comic Sans!  Your letters are lying to 
you! But if this illusion   wasn’t there, words would look really weird. And that’s because we don’t read with a ruler.   We read with our brain. And 
our brains like to lie to us. The reason all this happens is related to 
another illusion that maybe you’ve seen before. This line appears longer than this one. But 
in reality the two lines are the same length. This is one of the most famous 
illusions in visual science.   And there’s lots of different versions 
of it. I mean, this is one of the most   powerful illusions I’ve ever seen. Even 
when you know the lines are the same length,   it doesn’t change the story your brain tells you.
It’s really weird! So what does this have to do with letters? Well, we can explain what’s happening here if we turn the Müller-Lyer illusion on its side: This line, with its ends, 
looks kinda like the letter O. The other line is more like an I or a T. Our brains decide round letters like O look 
smaller than more squared off letters nearby,   so we have to make the O bigger 
just to look the same size.  So that’s a really cool 
illusion that fools you probably   hundreds of times a day. And it shows us 
that there’s a lot more going on with how   we recognize letters and words and turn 
them into meaning than you might expect. In other words: Reading is really weird. Now, a good reader can recognize 
hundreds of words per minute. And once you learn how to do it, most of us 
don’t have to actually think about reading. It just happens. But while it feels automatic, there’s 
a lot going on under the hood. Or under the skull really. You’re just not consciously aware of any of it. When ya think about it it’s actually 
pretty weird that we can read at all. I mean, our brains evolved, pretty much in their 
current form, a hundred thousand years ago or so. But writing is only a few thousand years old.  And standardized movable type, that was only 
invented like one thousand years ago, in Asia. And then Gutenberg invented 
it again like 600 years ago. I mean think about this: As recently as the 1800s 
maybe 1 in 8 people actually knew how to read. It’s clearly not something that we evolved 
to do. But we can. So what’s up with that? Luckily I happen to know a language expert, and 
she just so happens to have her own YouTube show.   So I asked her.
Thanks, Joe! I’m   Dr. Erica Brozovsky, sociolinguist and 
certified word nerd. On my show Otherwords, we delve into the amazing facets 
of human language,   and the ability to read is 
one that almost defies logic. How can a brain that evolved like a hundred 
thousand of years ago be so naturally good   at a skill that we only invented 5,000 years 
ago? It’s been called the “paradox of reading” The answer may be that we’ve repurposed 
some existing brain functions for new uses.   It’s a theory neuroscientist Stanislas 
Dehaene called "neural recycling" By studying the neural patterns of monkeys, 
scientists have been able to identify how   their brains identify and make sense of the 
contours and lines that make up visual scenes.   A corner here, an edge there, some intersecting 
edges here. And it seems like there’s a basic   "alphabet" of simple shapes that their brains 
use to decode any number of possible scenes. What’s interesting is these shapes are 
remarkably similar to the strokes that   make up most human writing. Whenever one 
object is behind another, you get a T   shape. Corners of objects 
make L's and F's and Y's. And an O can be found in anything from a 
delicious fruit… to the eye of a predator. What these shapes have in common is that 
they're "non-accidental". If you threw a bunch   of toothpicks on the floor, very rarely would 
three land with their ends perfectly touching.   So if you see this pattern in real life… 
it's probably worth paying attention to,   and our brains are especially 
adept at spotting it. Each pattern in this “shape 
alphabet” triggers neurons,   and when certain combinations 
of neurons fire together,   they trigger higher order neurons that help 
us eventually decode the meaning of an image. So this combination from our shape 
alphabet triggers the meaning   “cat”. And so does this combination.
Only, one is a group of shapes in nature,   and one is just a collection of lines on paper. Early alphabets that used such shapes allowed 
more people to read, and let them read faster,   eventually replacing cumbersome pictographic 
writing systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics.   As Dehaene says, "...our cortex did 
not specifically evolve for writing…   writing evolved to fit the cortex." That… is amazing. So let’s take a closer look at what’s happening   when your brain decodes all these shapes 
and tries to make meaning out of them. How do we read?! One thing that we know about reading   is that your brain isn’t sounding 
out words as you scan the page, like   speaking them in your head. I mean, you might 
be able to make yourself consciously do that… One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish That’s not how it works. When you read, your brain is directly 
turning those printed symbols into meaning. Now, words are made of letters. And we’ve already seen that we’re really   sensitive to the shapes combinations of 
letters have when they’re put together. So the big question to figure out is: When we 
recognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?
Or do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see 
an elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, 
tusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing 
and say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question 
out, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of 
people for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized 
the whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either 
real words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized 
some particular letter   And people recognized the right letter 
better when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our 
brains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. 
The “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think 
about how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or 
combinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect 
says that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. 
We just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we 
recognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it 
analyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the 
word “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to 
read lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible 
at reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned 
out to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you 
scan a page. But they’re not scanning   smoothly across lines of text. They jump 
around. Sometimes they even jump backwards. These little movements are 
called saccades. And they’re   really fast. One jump takes 20 to 35 milliseconds. 
Around 10 times faster than the blink of an eye. You don’t even notice this jumping because 
it happens so fast it doesn’t even have time   to register in your brain. But why can’t we see 
those jumps? Does anyone know a neuroscientist?! So here’s the crazy thing about saccades: 
Your eyes are jumping around about   three times a second, and in between 
that they're making these little micro   saccades, they're making little tiny jitters. But you can't see the whole world streaking by.   Why not? Well it's because when your 
eyes go on this ballistic jump if we   were actually seeing that it would look like 
the world is streaking around all the time So we don't experience that. Instead we 
just experience the world out there. Why? It's a very deep reason actually. 
It's because all you're ever seeing   is your internal model of the outside 
world. You're not seeing the world as it is. Because it actually takes time for your 
eye to move from one place to another.   So what happened to that time? Well it turns out   your brain says okay i'm going to fill 
in the gap with whatever I land on. When your eyes land on the thing 
you've got this gap in time and so your brain 
essentially  retrospectively fills that in. Thanks David Eagleman! Your eyes stop 
on a word for about 200 milliseconds,   then they jump forward 7 to 9 letters.
But somehow your eyes never land in between words. And some types of words: like short words 
or connector words like “the” and “and” Your eyes just skip right over them altogether. Now, how much information we gather each time 
our eyes stop is limited by how our eye is built. The fovea is the area in the center of your vision 
where the photoreceptors are most densely packed,   and where your vision is the sharpest. It 
senses an area about the size of your fingertip   at arm’s length. Around that is 
an area called the parafovea.   The photoreceptors are less dense, and it can 
see some details but things are kinda fuzzy.   And beyond that is basically your peripheral 
vision, where the photoreceptors can basically   just tell that there’s something there, but 
are absolutely terrible at figuring out what. Each time your eyes stop, 
in that split second you’re   gathering information from three different zones. In the center, your fovea clearly 
identifies 3 to 4 letters around   where your eyes stop. This is usually 
enough to recognize that single word. The second zone is in the 
parafovea. It’s much more blurry,   but can get at least a hint at what the 
first few letters of the next word are. And beyond that is an even blurrier zone. No 
letters being identified here, but importantly   you are sensing how long the next word or two is. This gives you enough information to decide 
where your eyes will move next. If the next   word is short and can be skipped, or whether it’s 
long and unfamiliar so you should stop on it. While you are recognizing the word you 
are actually looking at and focusing on,   another part of your eye is already reading 
ahead to tell you what’s coming next.  All in all your eyes only stop on 
about 60% of the words you read. Yet   somehow you still read all of them. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU’RE DOING THIS. So we seem to recognize words not because of their 
shape, but because of the letters they contain.   Which maybe isn’t that surprising,   except we’re seeing most of those 
letters without actually looking at them. We think the way we recognize 
words works something like this:   When your eyes land on or near a word, say SOAP,   you see ALL the letters, that is, you process 
their shapes - basically simultaneously. You don’t scan the letters 
from left to right one by one,   as if your brain is looking 
up a word in a dictionary. You know, the first letter "s" the second 
letter "o" . . . it doesn’t work that way. Your brain simultaneously compares   each letter position with those in 
all the words you’ve seen before. Think of your mental dictionary as a pool 
full of words. Every word with one letter   in common gets a little jolt in your brain’s 
neural networks and floats above the rest.  The words with two letters in common get a 
bigger jolt in your brain and rise above those. Then the words with three letters 
in common get an even bigger jolt. Until finally, the strongest signal in the 
neural network of your brain’s dictionary   rises to the top, and that’s the 
winner: The word you recognize. This happens over and over as your eyes 
jump from spot to spot across the page,   taking in different kinds of information from 
various parts of your eye, unconsciously reading   ahead in your brain, activating countless neural 
networks, all in less than a quarter of a second.   And then you move your eyes, and do it again, 
and again, and again. All thanks to some ancient   evolutionary ability you have to recognize 
certain shapes, curves, and corners.  And the coolest part of all this is 
the next time you pick up a book,   you won’t even think about 
any of this. You’ll just   enjoy a good story. As long as the I’s 
and the O’s are the right size at least… Stay curious. And as always, a huge thank you to

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. Today I’m going to teach you how to read. Which 
is something that you already know how to do,   obviously, but you probably have no 
idea how you’re actually doing it. But first I need to let you in on a secret: There’s a trick being played on 
you every time you read something. In fact it’s right in front of 
you right now. Do you see it? Let’s take a closer look at just a couple 
of letters and see if you can see it then.  Here’s just the C and T. These two 
letters are exactly the same weight,   or “size” in this typeface, so you’d 
figure they’re the exact same height.   But watch what happens when I lay them on top 
of each other. The C is ever-so-slightly taller. It’s true for other letter pairs 
too. Like E and S. The S is taller. It’s even true for other typefaces, like this one.  Letters that look the same size 
are actually… not the same size. And this… is on purpose. Because if they actually were the 
same size, mathematically speaking they wouldn’t look the same size. Letters with rounded tops have to be slightly 
taller than letters with flat tops in order for   them to appear the same size.
This illusion is hiding   in just about everything you’ve ever read.
Yes, it’s even in Comic Sans!  Your letters are lying to 
you! But if this illusion   wasn’t there, words would look really weird. And that’s because we don’t read with a ruler.   We read with our brain. And 
our brains like to lie to us. The reason all this happens is related to 
another illusion that maybe you’ve seen before. This line appears longer than this one. But 
in reality the two lines are the same length. This is one of the most famous 
illusions in visual science.   And there’s lots of different versions 
of it. I mean, this is one of the most   powerful illusions I’ve ever seen. Even 
when you know the lines are the same length,   it doesn’t change the story your brain tells you.
It’s really weird! So what does this have to do with letters? Well, we can explain what’s happening here if we turn the Müller-Lyer illusion on its side: This line, with its ends, 
looks kinda like the letter O. The other line is more like an I or a T. Our brains decide round letters like O look 
smaller than more squared off letters nearby,   so we have to make the O bigger 
just to look the same size.  So that’s a really cool 
illusion that fools you probably   hundreds of times a day. And it shows us 
that there’s a lot more going on with how   we recognize letters and words and turn 
them into meaning than you might expect. In other words: Reading is really weird. Now, a good reader can recognize 
hundreds of words per minute. And once you learn how to do it, most of us 
don’t have to actually think about reading. It just happens. But while it feels automatic, there’s 
a lot going on under the hood. Or under the skull really. You’re just not consciously aware of any of it. When ya think about it it’s actually 
pretty weird that we can read at all. I mean, our brains evolved, pretty much in their 
current form, a hundred thousand years ago or so. But writing is only a few thousand years old.  And standardized movable type, that was only 
invented like one thousand years ago, in Asia. And then Gutenberg invented 
it again like 600 years ago. I mean think about this: As recently as the 1800s 
maybe 1 in 8 people actually knew how to read. It’s clearly not something that we evolved 
to do. But we can. So what’s up with that? Luckily I happen to know a language expert, and 
she just so happens to have her own YouTube show.   So I asked her.
Thanks, Joe! I’m   Dr. Erica Brozovsky, sociolinguist and 
certified word nerd. On my show Otherwords, we delve into the amazing facets 
of human language,   and the ability to read is 
one that almost defies logic. How can a brain that evolved like a hundred 
thousand of years ago be so naturally good   at a skill that we only invented 5,000 years 
ago? It’s been called the “paradox of reading” The answer may be that we’ve repurposed 
some existing brain functions for new uses.   It’s a theory neuroscientist Stanislas 
Dehaene called "neural recycling" By studying the neural patterns of monkeys, 
scientists have been able to identify how   their brains identify and make sense of the 
contours and lines that make up visual scenes.   A corner here, an edge there, some intersecting 
edges here. And it seems like there’s a basic   "alphabet" of simple shapes that their brains 
use to decode any number of possible scenes. What’s interesting is these shapes are 
remarkably similar to the strokes that   make up most human writing. Whenever one 
object is behind another, you get a T   shape. Corners of objects 
make L's and F's and Y's. And an O can be found in anything from a 
delicious fruit… to the eye of a predator. What these shapes have in common is that 
they're "non-accidental". If you threw a bunch   of toothpicks on the floor, very rarely would 
three land with their ends perfectly touching.   So if you see this pattern in real life… 
it's probably worth paying attention to,   and our brains are especially 
adept at spotting it. Each pattern in this “shape 
alphabet” triggers neurons,   and when certain combinations 
of neurons fire together,   they trigger higher order neurons that help 
us eventually decode the meaning of an image. So this combination from our shape 
alphabet triggers the meaning   “cat”. And so does this combination.
Only, one is a group of shapes in nature,   and one is just a collection of lines on paper. Early alphabets that used such shapes allowed 
more people to read, and let them read faster,   eventually replacing cumbersome pictographic 
writing systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics.   As Dehaene says, "...our cortex did 
not specifically evolve for writing…   writing evolved to fit the cortex." That… is amazing. So let’s take a closer look at what’s happening   when your brain decodes all these shapes 
and tries to make meaning out of them. How do we read?! One thing that we know about reading   is that your brain isn’t sounding 
out words as you scan the page, like   speaking them in your head. I mean, you might 
be able to make yourself consciously do that… One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish That’s not how it works. When you read, your brain is directly 
turning those printed symbols into meaning. Now, words are made of letters. And we’ve already seen that we’re really   sensitive to the shapes combinations of 
letters have when they’re put together. So the big question to figure out is: When we 
recognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?
Or do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see 
an elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, 
tusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing 
and say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question 
out, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of 
people for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized 
the whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either 
real words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized 
some particular letter   And people recognized the right letter 
better when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our 
brains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. 
The “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think 
about how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or 
combinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect 
says that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. 
We just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we 
recognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it 
analyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the 
word “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to 
read lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible 
at reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned 
out to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. Today I’m going to teach you how to read. Which 
is something that you already know how to do,   obviously, but you probably have no 
idea how you’re actually doing it. But first I need to let you in on a secret: There’s a trick being played on 
you every time you read something. In fact it’s right in front of 
you right now. Do you see it? Let’s take a closer look at just a couple 
of letters and see if you can see it then.  Here’s just the C and T. These two 
letters are exactly the same weight,   or “size” in this typeface, so you’d 
figure they’re the exact same height.   But watch what happens when I lay them on top 
of each other. The C is ever-so-slightly taller. It’s true for other letter pairs 
too. Like E and S. The S is taller. It’s even true for other typefaces, like this one.  Letters that look the same size 
are actually… not the same size. And this… is on purpose. Because if they actually were the 
same size, mathematically speaking they wouldn’t look the same size. Letters with rounded tops have to be slightly 
taller than letters with flat tops in order for   them to appear the same size.
This illusion is hiding   in just about everything you’ve ever read.
Yes, it’s even in Comic Sans!  Your letters are lying to 
you! But if this illusion   wasn’t there, words would look really weird. And that’s because we don’t read with a ruler.   We read with our brain. And 
our brains like to lie to us. The reason all this happens is related to 
another illusion that maybe you’ve seen before. This line appears longer than this one. But 
in reality the two lines are the same length. This is one of the most famous 
illusions in visual science.   And there’s lots of different versions 
of it. I mean, this is one of the most   powerful illusions I’ve ever seen. Even 
when you know the lines are the same length,   it doesn’t change the story your brain tells you.
It’s really weird! So what does this have to do with letters? Well, we can explain what’s happening here if we turn the Müller-Lyer illusion on its side: This line, with its ends, 
looks kinda like the letter O. The other line is more like an I or a T. Our brains decide round letters like O look 
smaller than more squared off letters nearby,   so we have to make the O bigger 
just to look the same size.  So that’s a really cool 
illusion that fools you probably   hundreds of times a day. And it shows us 
that there’s a lot more going on with how   we recognize letters and words and turn 
them into meaning than you might expect. In other words: Reading is really weird. Now, a good reader can recognize 
hundreds of words per minute. And once you learn how to do it, most of us 
don’t have to actually think about reading. It just happens. But while it feels automatic, there’s 
a lot going on under the hood. Or under the skull really. You’re just not consciously aware of any of it. When ya think about it it’s actually 
pretty weird that we can read at all. I mean, our brains evolved, pretty much in their 
current form, a hundred thousand years ago or so. But writing is only a few thousand years old.  And standardized movable type, that was only 
invented like one thousand years ago, in Asia. And then Gutenberg invented 
it again like 600 years ago. I mean think about this: As recently as the 1800s 
maybe 1 in 8 people actually knew how to read. It’s clearly not something that we evolved 
to do. But we can. So what’s up with that? Luckily I happen to know a language expert, and 
she just so happens to have her own YouTube show.   So I asked her.
Thanks, Joe! I’m   Dr. Erica Brozovsky, sociolinguist and 
certified word nerd. On my show Otherwords, we delve into the amazing facets 
of human language,   and the ability to read is 
one that almost defies logic. How can a brain that evolved like a hundred 
thousand of years ago be so naturally good   at a skill that we only invented 5,000 years 
ago? It’s been called the “paradox of reading” The answer may be that we’ve repurposed 
some existing brain functions for new uses.   It’s a theory neuroscientist Stanislas 
Dehaene called "neural recycling" By studying the neural patterns of monkeys, 
scientists have been able to identify how   their brains identify and make sense of the 
contours and lines that make up visual scenes.   A corner here, an edge there, some intersecting 
edges here. And it seems like there’s a basic   "alphabet" of simple shapes that their brains 
use to decode any number of possible scenes. What’s interesting is these shapes are 
remarkably similar to the strokes that   make up most human writing. Whenever one 
object is behind another, you get a T   shape. Corners of objects 
make L's and F's and Y's. And an O can be found in anything from a 
delicious fruit… to the eye of a predator. What these shapes have in common is that 
they're "non-accidental". If you threw a bunch   of toothpicks on the floor, very rarely would 
three land with their ends perfectly touching.   So if you see this pattern in real life… 
it's probably worth paying attention to,   and our brains are especially 
adept at spotting it. Each pattern in this “shape 
alphabet” triggers neurons,   and when certain combinations 
of neurons fire together,   they trigger higher order neurons that help 
us eventually decode the meaning of an image. So this combination from our shape 
alphabet triggers the meaning   “cat”. And so does this combination.
Only, one is a group of shapes in nature,   and one is just a collection of lines on paper. Early alphabets that used such shapes allowed 
more people to read, and let them read faster,   eventually replacing cumbersome pictographic 
writing systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics.   As Dehaene says, "...our cortex did 
not specifically evolve for writing…   writing evolved to fit the cortex." That… is amazing. So let’s take a closer look at what’s happening   when your brain decodes all these shapes 
and tries to make meaning out of them. How do we read?! One thing that we know about reading   is that your brain isn’t sounding 
out words as you scan the page, like   speaking them in your head. I mean, you might 
be able to make yourself consciously do that… One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish That’s not how it works. When you read, your brain is directly 
turning those printed symbols into meaning. Now, words are made of letters. And we’ve already seen that we’re really   sensitive to the shapes combinations of 
letters have when they’re put together. So the big question to figure out is: When we 
recognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?
Or do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see 
an elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, 
tusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing 
and say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question 
out, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of 
people for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized 
the whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either 
real words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized 
some particular letter   And people recognized the right letter 
better when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our 
brains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. 
The “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think 
about how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or 
combinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect 
says that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. 
We just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we 
recognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it 
analyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the 
word “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to 
read lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible 
at reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned 
out to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you 
scan a page. But they’re not scanning   smoothly across lines of text. They jump 
around. Sometimes they even jump backwards. These little movements are 
called saccades. And they’re   really fast. One jump takes 20 to 35 milliseconds. 
Around 10 times faster than the blink of an eye. You don’t even notice this jumping because 
it happens so fast it doesn’t even have time   to register in your brain. But why can’t we see 
those jumps? Does anyone know a neuroscientist?! So here’s the crazy thing about saccades: 
Your eyes are jumping around about   three times a second, and in between 
that they're making these little micro   saccades, they're making little tiny jitters. But you can't see the whole world streaking by.   Why not? Well it's because when your 
eyes go on this ballistic jump if we   were actually seeing that it would look like 
the world is streaking around all the time So we don't experience that. Instead we 
just experience the world out there. Why? It's a very deep reason actually. 
It's because all you're ever seeing   is your internal model of the outside 
world. You're not seeing the world as it is. Because it actually takes time for your 
eye to move from one place to another.   So what happened to that time? Well it turns out   your brain says okay i'm going to fill 
in the gap with whatever I land on. When your eyes land on the thing 
you've got this gap in time and so your brain 
essentially  retrospectively fills that in. Thanks David Eagleman! Your eyes stop 
on a word for about 200 milliseconds,   then they jump forward 7 to 9 letters.
But somehow your eyes never land in between words. And some types of words: like short words 
or connector words like “the” and “and” Your eyes just skip right over them altogether. Now, how much information we gather each time 
our eyes stop is limited by how our eye is built. The fovea is the area in the center of your vision 
where the photoreceptors are most densely packed,   and where your vision is the sharpest. It 
senses an area about the size of your fingertip   at arm’s length. Around that is 
an area called the parafovea.   The photoreceptors are less dense, and it can 
see some details but things are kinda fuzzy.   And beyond that is basically your peripheral 
vision, where the photoreceptors can basically   just tell that there’s something there, but 
are absolutely terrible at figuring out what. Each time your eyes stop, 
in that split second you’re   gathering information from three different zones. In the center, your fovea clearly 
identifies 3 to 4 letters around   where your eyes stop. This is usually 
enough to recognize that single word. The second zone is in the 
parafovea. It’s much more blurry,   but can get at least a hint at what the 
first few letters of the next word are. And beyond that is an even blurrier zone. No 
letters being identified here, but importantly   you are sensing how long the next word or two is. This gives you enough information to decide 
where your eyes will move next. If the next   word is short and can be skipped, or whether it’s 
long and unfamiliar so you should stop on it. While you are recognizing the word you 
are actually looking at and focusing on,   another part of your eye is already reading 
ahead to tell you what’s coming next.  All in all your eyes only stop on 
about 60% of the words you read. Yet   somehow you still read all of them. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU’RE DOING THIS. So we seem to recognize words not because of their 
shape, but because of the letters they contain.   Which maybe isn’t that surprising,   except we’re seeing most of those 
letters without actually looking at them. We think the way we recognize 
words works something like this:   When your eyes land on or near a word, say SOAP,   you see ALL the letters, that is, you process 
their shapes - basically simultaneously. You don’t scan the letters 
from left to right one by one,   as if your brain is looking 
up a word in a dictionary. You know, the first letter "s" the second 
letter "o" . . . it doesn’t work that way. Your brain simultaneously compares   each letter position with those in 
all the words you’ve seen before. Think of your mental dictionary as a pool 
full of words. Every word with one letter   in common gets a little jolt in your brain’s 
neural networks and floats above the rest.  The words with two letters in common get a 
bigger jolt in your brain and rise above those. Then the words with three letters 
in common get an even bigger jolt. Until finally, the strongest signal in the 
neural network of your brain’s dictionary   rises to the top, and that’s the 
winner: The word you recognize. This happens over and over as your eyes 
jump from spot to spot across the page,   taking in different kinds of information from 
various parts of your eye, unconsciously reading   ahead in your brain, activating countless neural 
networks, all in less than a quarter of a second.   And then you move your eyes, and do it again, 
and again, and again. All thanks to some ancient   evolutionary ability you have to recognize 
certain shapes, curves, and corners.  And the coolest part of all this is 
the next time you pick up a book,   you won’t even think about 
any of this. You’ll just   enjoy a good story. As long as the I’s 
and the O’s are the right size at least… Stay curious. And as always, a huge thank you to

**Transcript**:
Throughout the 1800s,
in saloons across the West, you could find cowboys
locked in tense standoffs. But these weren’t shootouts. They were simply playing cards— for a mountain of chips
worth their weight in gold. Most men wore loaded pistols
in case a player was caught cheating. When they prepared to make
their bets, however, these cowboys weren’t focused
on their holsters or their cards, but rather on their opponent’s face. Because not even a bullet could protect
them from a well-executed bluff. From its earliest incarnations,
poker has always been a battle of nerves. The game first emerged around 1800
in the melting pot of New Orleans. At this time, two games
ruled the card tables: French poque played with a 20-card deck,
and English Brag which used 52-cards. Both these games saw players being dealt
five cards from a four-suit deck, and then trying to make the best hand
possible according to a simple hierarchy. They would then wager on whether
or not they had the best hand— either adding more money to the pot or folding and forfeiting
their chance to win it. But since each player's cards were only
revealed at the end of the hand, someone with bad cards could always bluff— betting enough to scare
his opponents into folding. Both games had slightly different hand
combinations, but most importantly, Brag allowed players to discard
and draw new cards, making better hands more likely and
allowing for another round of betting. Eventually, the Southerners merged
the two games into a new version of poque—
which they pronounced pokuh— that created bigger pots and
opportunities for more complex bluffing. This winning combination of guile, guts,
and gambling caught on quickly. But its popularity skyrocketed
after the invention of the steamboat, which carried livestock, goods,
and card games up the Mississippi, Ohio,
and Missouri rivers. By Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860, Americans in every state and territory
were playing the newfangled bluffing game. And while many played
for low, friendly stakes, some gamblers put their homes
and livelihoods on the line. These life-changing bets even found
their way into popular novels like “Gone with the Wind,” where Scarlett O’Hara’s father wins
an entire plantation in a single hand of poker. But as pots became bigger, 
so did the temptation to cheat. Some players enlisted an accomplice
to spy on opponents and used props to communicate their hands. Others marked important cards with nicks,
dents, or invisible ink. But perhaps the most common method was
sneaking a cold deck into the game. Cold decks were pre-sequenced
to give victims powerful hands that encouraged them to bet big, while giving the cheater
an even better one. However, even cheaters had to keep
up with the game’s constant changes. As poker moved west with the Gold Rush,
new variants emerged. Five-card Stud became the game of choice among notorious gunmen like Doc Holliday,
Wyatt Earp, and Wild Bill Hickok. With four rounds of betting, Five-card Stud produced
even more lucrative pots, encouraging so much cheating that
California outlawed the game in 1885. Meanwhile, back in Texas,
another variant emerged to solve the common problem of having
too many players and not enough cards. This game, known as Texas Hold'em, became a favorite because its low ratio
of private, hidden cards to shared, exposed cards allowed for plenty of deductions
and tactical maneuvering. Even more exciting was no-limit Hold’em,
which allowed players to go all in, betting everything they had
at any point in the hand. In 1928, Hungarian polymath
John von Neumann sought to explain the nuances of betting
and bluffing in mathematical terms. His work became the foundation
for a whole new branch of mathematics called game theory, which has grown to be vitally important
not only in high-stakes poker, but in economics and military strategy. In the late 20th century,
game theory became essential for navigating the geopolitical bluffing
game of nuclear warfare. Today, America’s card game
is an international affair, attracting players
from over a hundred countries to the annual World Series of Poker. Fortunes are made and lost every
day on casino floors, poker websites, and in thousands of live
and online tournaments. So while a single game's outcome
will never be certain, poker is definitely here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Throughout the 1800s,
in saloons across the West, you could find cowboys
locked in tense standoffs. But these weren’t shootouts. They were simply playing cards— for a mountain of chips
worth their weight in gold. Most men wore loaded pistols
in case a player was caught cheating. When they prepared to make
their bets, however, these cowboys weren’t focused
on their holsters or their cards, but rather on their opponent’s face. Because not even a bullet could protect
them from a well-executed bluff. From its earliest incarnations,
poker has always been a battle of nerves. The game first emerged around 1800
in the melting pot of New Orleans. At this time, two games
ruled the card tables: French poque played with a 20-card deck,
and English Brag which used 52-cards. Both these games saw players being dealt
five cards from a four-suit deck, and then trying to make the best hand
possible according to a simple hierarchy. They would then wager on whether
or not they had the best hand— either adding more money to the pot or folding and forfeiting
their chance to win it. But since each player's cards were only
revealed at the end of the hand, someone with bad cards could always bluff— betting enough to scare
his opponents into folding. Both games had slightly different hand
combinations, but most importantly, Brag allowed players to discard
and draw new cards, making better hands more likely and
allowing for another round of betting. Eventually, the Southerners merged
the two games into a new version of poque—
which they pronounced pokuh— that created bigger pots and
opportunities for more complex bluffing. This winning combination of guile, guts,
and gambling caught on quickly. But its popularity skyrocketed
after the invention of the steamboat, which carried livestock, goods,
and card games up the Mississippi, Ohio,
and Missouri rivers. By Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860, Americans in every state and territory
were playing the newfangled bluffing game. And while many played
for low, friendly stakes, some gamblers put their homes
and livelihoods on the line. These life-changing bets even found
their way into popular novels like “Gone with the Wind,” where Scarlett O’Hara’s father wins
an entire plantation in a single hand of poker. But as pots became bigger, 
so did the temptation to cheat. Some players enlisted an accomplice
to spy on opponents and used props to communicate their hands. Others marked important cards with nicks,
dents, or invisible ink. But perhaps the most common method was
sneaking a cold deck into the game. Cold decks were pre-sequenced
to give victims powerful hands that encouraged them to bet big, while giving the cheater
an even better one. However, even cheaters had to keep
up with the game’s constant changes. As poker moved west with the Gold Rush,
new variants emerged. Five-card Stud became the game of choice among notorious gunmen like Doc Holliday,
Wyatt Earp, and Wild Bill Hickok. With four rounds of betting, Five-card Stud produced
even more lucrative pots, encouraging so much cheating that
California outlawed the game in 1885. Meanwhile, back in Texas,
another variant emerged to solve the common problem of having
too many players and not enough cards. This game, known as Texas Hold'em, became a favorite because its low ratio
of private, hidden cards to shared, exposed cards allowed for plenty of deductions
and tactical maneuvering. Even more exciting was no-limit Hold’em,
which allowed players to go all in, betting everything they had
at any point in the hand. In 1928, Hungarian polymath
John von Neumann sought to explain the nuances of betting
and bluffing in mathematical terms. His work became the foundation
for a whole new branch of mathematics called game theory, which has grown to be vitally important
not only in high-stakes poker, but in economics and military strategy. In the late 20th century,
game theory became essential for navigating the geopolitical bluffing
game of nuclear warfare. Today, America’s card game
is an international affair, attracting players
from over a hundred countries to the annual World Series of Poker. Fortunes are made and lost every
day on casino floors, poker websites, and in thousands of live
and online tournaments. So while a single game's outcome
will never be certain, poker is definitely here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Isn’t it odd that, when something’s funny, you might show your teeth,
change your breathing, become weak and achy in some places,
and maybe even cry? In other words, why do we do
this bizarre thing that is laughter? When you laugh, your abdominal muscles
contract rapidly. This alters your breathing patterns, increasing the pressure in your
chest cavity, and pushing air out, which might audibly emerge as a snort,
wheeze, or vocalization. Because you’re exerting your abdominal
muscles much more than you usually would while talking, they may start to hurt. Laughter also inhibits your reflexes
and muscle control, causing sensations like leg weakness. So, where does this funny phenomenon
come from? Because there’s no archaeological
record of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why
it evolved, but scientists have some theories. Importantly, humans are not
the only animals today that do something like laughter. Using ultrasonic recorders, researchers in the late 90s realized
that rats were basically giggling while being tickled. Scientists have since compiled evidence
of at least 65 species— mostly mammals, but also some birds—
that vocalize during social play. Some, unsurprisingly,
are our closest relatives. By recording and analyzing the sounds
primates make while playing and being tickled, researchers grew more convinced that
the ancient ancestor of all great apes did something like laughter. And, because other apes make laughter-like
sounds during rough-and-tumble play, they think laughter may have originally
developed to clearly signal friendly, non-aggressive intent. But of course, humans don’t just laugh
when we’re wrestling, but also when we’re amused,
and even surprised, confused, or nervous. Some scientists think laughter took
on expanded functions after humans split from other great apes and developed large social groups
and more complex language abilities. They hypothesize that laughter gradually
became something we could use not just during play but within speech
to convey subtle meanings and a range of contexts
to show our emotions. This is thought to be one of the reasons
that laughter is contagious: it’s like an invitation to share
in someone’s emotional state. Just hearing clips of laughter can
activate key regions in your brain, triggering you to smile or laugh yourself. And, when participants in one study
watched a funny video, they laughed significantly longer
and more often when another person was present— even though they reported feeling
the same level of amusement. Human laughter is also generally louder than the play vocalizations
of most animals. Some scientists speculate that this
is because our laughter functions not only as a signal between individuals,
but a broadcast to everyone around. Studies found that observers across the
world and as young as 5 months old could reliably tell the difference
between close friends and acquaintances just from brief clips of them laughing. Similarly, we can tell whether a laugh
is real or fake based just on the sound. Fake, or volitional, laughter is produced in entirely different networks
in the brain, relying on speech-like pathways. Meanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises
from older networks that other animals also use
for their vocalizations. And laughter is not just
socially important; it’s also thought to be good for us. When we laugh, our brains release
feel-good neurotransmitters like endorphins, and decrease levels of stress hormones
like cortisol. Some research even suggests that people
who laugh more can cope with stress more effectively
and have better cardiovascular health. Laughter is a universal human behavior. Babies can laugh before they can speak. Whether it's the best medicine
depends on your ailment. But as something that makes
life more tolerable, strengthens bonds, and potentially
improves aspects of your health, you can’t go wrong with a good laugh. Unless you have a broken rib or something. Then it’s no laughing matter. Certainly nothing to crack up about.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about which animals do or do not make sounds during play, which is the main focus of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, as it discusses the evolution of laughter in humans and mentions the sounds made by other animals during play. Nevertheless, it does not directly address the question of which animals do not make sounds during play.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the specific animals that do or do not make sounds during play.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What is one possible reason why human laughter is generally louder than the play vocalizations of most animals?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Compares human laughter to other animals' play vocalizations.
2. Asks about a specific aspect of human laughter (loudness).
3. Provides options that are related to the possible reasons for this difference.

Although the question is not an exact match, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about what is NOT special about human laughter, while Question 6 asks about a possible reason for a specific difference. However, both questions are related to the comparison between human laughter and other animals' play vocalizations.

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly addresses the relationship between laughter and stress. 

The most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 3, but it does not directly address the health benefits of laughter. 

A more suitable match would be a question that combines the intent of Questions 3 and 7. However, since we must choose from the existing options, the most suitable match is Question 7, but another option, Question 3, is related to the topic.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 3, mentions a neurotransmitter that would likely be of interest in measuring the effects of laughter on stress levels. 

Considering all the options, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, but Question 3 is a close match in terms of the relationship between laughter and stress relief.

However, another generated MCQ is a more direct match. 

The correct answer is Question 7, but there is another question that addresses a similar topic.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Isn’t it odd that, when something’s funny, you might show your teeth,
change your breathing, become weak and achy in some places,
and maybe even cry? In other words, why do we do
this bizarre thing that is laughter? When you laugh, your abdominal muscles
contract rapidly. This alters your breathing patterns, increasing the pressure in your
chest cavity, and pushing air out, which might audibly emerge as a snort,
wheeze, or vocalization. Because you’re exerting your abdominal
muscles much more than you usually would while talking, they may start to hurt. Laughter also inhibits your reflexes
and muscle control, causing sensations like leg weakness. So, where does this funny phenomenon
come from? Because there’s no archaeological
record of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why
it evolved, but scientists have some theories. Importantly, humans are not
the only animals today that do something like laughter. Using ultrasonic recorders, researchers in the late 90s realized
that rats were basically giggling while being tickled. Scientists have since compiled evidence
of at least 65 species— mostly mammals, but also some birds—
that vocalize during social play. Some, unsurprisingly,
are our closest relatives. By recording and analyzing the sounds
primates make while playing and being tickled, researchers grew more convinced that
the ancient ancestor of all great apes did something like laughter. And, because other apes make laughter-like
sounds during rough-and-tumble play, they think laughter may have originally
developed to clearly signal friendly, non-aggressive intent. But of course, humans don’t just laugh
when we’re wrestling, but also when we’re amused,
and even surprised, confused, or nervous. Some scientists think laughter took
on expanded functions after humans split from other great apes and developed large social groups
and more complex language abilities. They hypothesize that laughter gradually
became something we could use not just during play but within speech
to convey subtle meanings and a range of contexts
to show our emotions. This is thought to be one of the reasons
that laughter is contagious: it’s like an invitation to share
in someone’s emotional state. Just hearing clips of laughter can
activate key regions in your brain, triggering you to smile or laugh yourself. And, when participants in one study
watched a funny video, they laughed significantly longer
and more often when another person was present— even though they reported feeling
the same level of amusement. Human laughter is also generally louder than the play vocalizations
of most animals. Some scientists speculate that this
is because our laughter functions not only as a signal between individuals,
but a broadcast to everyone around. Studies found that observers across the
world and as young as 5 months old could reliably tell the difference
between close friends and acquaintances just from brief clips of them laughing. Similarly, we can tell whether a laugh
is real or fake based just on the sound. Fake, or volitional, laughter is produced in entirely different networks
in the brain, relying on speech-like pathways. Meanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises
from older networks that other animals also use
for their vocalizations. And laughter is not just
socially important; it’s also thought to be good for us. When we laugh, our brains release
feel-good neurotransmitters like endorphins, and decrease levels of stress hormones
like cortisol. Some research even suggests that people
who laugh more can cope with stress more effectively
and have better cardiovascular health. Laughter is a universal human behavior. Babies can laugh before they can speak. Whether it's the best medicine
depends on your ailment. But as something that makes
life more tolerable, strengthens bonds, and potentially
improves aspects of your health, you can’t go wrong with a good laugh. Unless you have a broken rib or something. Then it’s no laughing matter. Certainly nothing to crack up about.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: A researcher is studying the effects of laughter on social bonding. What age group would they likely be interested in studying, according to the transcript? Options: A. Infants under 5 months old, B. Children between 5 months and 1 year old, C. Adults over 30 years old, D. All age groups Correct Option: B**

However, I noticed that the correct option in Question 8 is not exactly the same as the correct option in the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ states that listeners from around the world can tell the difference between close friends and acquaintances just from hearing brief clips of them laughing together **by 5 months old**.

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the age at which listeners can differentiate between close friends and acquaintances based on their laughter. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would still recommend Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that the correct option should be A. Infants under 5 months old (or more specifically, "by 5 months old") to match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the fight to curb climate change, there are few solutions more discussed
than planting lots and lots of trees. It sounds simple enough— trees absorb
CO2 from the atmosphere to grow, so planting more of them should help
eliminate greenhouse gases. The trouble is, tree planting efforts
don't always work as planned. For example, between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped
fund the planting of over a million hectares of new trees. Yet a recent analysis suggests
this multi-million dollar effort resulted in no major carbon storage gains. What went wrong? Chile focused on afforestation: the planting of trees in places long
devoid of— or never home to— any forest, as opposed to reforestation, the practice of restoring recently
degraded forests. Many governments and international
organizations champion afforestation in their efforts to meet
lofty tree planting goals that require massive amounts of land. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011
by the German government and the International Union
for Conservation of Nature, aims to restore 350 million hectares
of degraded land across the globe by 2030, in part through afforestation. Many companies have also seized
on tree planting to offset emissions and, in some cases, negative PR from their
contributions to the climate emergency. A 2021 Oxfam analysis found that the area
needed to match the tree planting goals set by four of the largest
oil and gas producers would require land twice the size
of the UK. Here's where things get complicated. In order to be a long-term carbon sink, trees need to grow to maturity
and stay put. Most of Chile's afforestation funding went
to the commercial forestry industry, which drastically expanded plantations
of mostly non-native trees— in some cases even by plowing
into native forests. According to one study, on average, natural forests are 40 times better
at carbon storage than plantations. A mature tree can absorb up to
22 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. But plantation trees are harvested. Further, pine and eucalyptus—
two commonly grown plantation trees— are highly flammable, so gains in carbon storage
can quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,
of the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative
in Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas
threatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,
not to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years
of tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation
tucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected
from fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have
unintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb
more of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t
plant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which
species to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting
native trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more
efficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests
and let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow
from old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds
deliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice
assisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses
that compete with saplings, preventing grazing,
and even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees
in the wrong places. It’s bad when it’s mistakenly used
as a catch-all solution, rather than addressing more
complex issues like carbon emissions and active deforestation. It’s also bad to plant trees when it
allows companies and governments to practice greenwashing, throwing money at initiatives that
have no real chance of achieving the carbon offsets they promise. The best investments in a greener future
are to cut carbon emissions, while protecting these forests from being
destroyed in the first place.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question has the same intent as the ground truth MCQ, which is to evaluate the outcome of Chile's tree planting efforts between 1974 and 2012. The options for Question 3 are also similar to the ground truth MCQ, with the correct option being "No major carbon storage gains" in both cases.

However, it's worth noting that Question 3 does not directly address the main issue with Chile's tree planting efforts, which is the focus on afforestation instead of reforestation. Therefore, while Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, it is not an exact match.

A more exact match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the main issue with Chile's tree planting efforts, such as:

Question: What was the main issue with Chile's tree planting efforts between 1974 and 2012?
Options: A. Lack of government funding, B. The trees did not absorb enough CO2, C. Focus on afforestation instead of reforestation, D. Poor tree growth due to climate conditions

Unfortunately, this exact question is not among the generated MCQs. However, Question 2 does address the difference between afforestation and reforestation, which is related to the main issue with Chile's tree planting efforts.

**Transcript**:
In the fight to curb climate change, there are few solutions more discussed
than planting lots and lots of trees. It sounds simple enough— trees absorb
CO2 from the atmosphere to grow, so planting more of them should help
eliminate greenhouse gases. The trouble is, tree planting efforts
don't always work as planned. For example, between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped
fund the planting of over a million hectares of new trees. Yet a recent analysis suggests
this multi-million dollar effort resulted in no major carbon storage gains. What went wrong? Chile focused on afforestation: the planting of trees in places long
devoid of— or never home to— any forest, as opposed to reforestation, the practice of restoring recently
degraded forests. Many governments and international
organizations champion afforestation in their efforts to meet
lofty tree planting goals that require massive amounts of land. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011
by the German government and the International Union
for Conservation of Nature, aims to restore 350 million hectares
of degraded land across the globe by 2030, in part through afforestation. Many companies have also seized
on tree planting to offset emissions and, in some cases, negative PR from their
contributions to the climate emergency. A 2021 Oxfam analysis found that the area
needed to match the tree planting goals set by four of the largest
oil and gas producers would require land twice the size
of the UK. Here's where things get complicated. In order to be a long-term carbon sink, trees need to grow to maturity
and stay put. Most of Chile's afforestation funding went
to the commercial forestry industry, which drastically expanded plantations
of mostly non-native trees— in some cases even by plowing
into native forests. According to one study, on average, natural forests are 40 times better
at carbon storage than plantations. A mature tree can absorb up to
22 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. But plantation trees are harvested. Further, pine and eucalyptus—
two commonly grown plantation trees— are highly flammable, so gains in carbon storage
can quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,
of the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative
in Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas
threatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,
not to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years
of tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation
tucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected
from fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have
unintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb
more of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t
plant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which
species to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting
native trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more
efficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests
and let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow
from old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds
deliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice
assisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses
that compete with saplings, preventing grazing,
and even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees
in the wrong places. It’s bad when it’s mistakenly used
as a catch-all solution, rather than addressing more
complex issues like carbon emissions and active deforestation. It’s also bad to plant trees when it
allows companies and governments to practice greenwashing, throwing money at initiatives that
have no real chance of achieving the carbon offsets they promise. The best investments in a greener future
are to cut carbon emissions, while protecting these forests from being
destroyed in the first place.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the land required to meet the tree planting goals of four major oil and gas producers, according to a 2021 Oxfam analysis.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, which asks about the goal of the Bonn Challenge. Although it does not specifically ask about the land required to meet the tree planting goals of oil and gas producers, it does mention a related initiative (the Bonn Challenge) that aims to restore degraded land.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, I would suggest that there is no direct match. But I can propose a potential match based on the theme of tree planting goals and land requirements.

A potential match could be a new generated MCQ that is not present in the list, but a similar one is Question 3, which asks about the outcome of the Chilean government's afforestation efforts. It does not directly ask about land requirements, but it does discuss the effectiveness of afforestation efforts, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index from the provided list, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but it is not a direct match.

Index: 9 (Please note that this is not a direct match, but rather a suggestion based on the available options.)

can quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,
of the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative
in Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas
threatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,
not to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years
of tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation
tucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected
from fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have
unintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb
more of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t
plant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which
species to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting
native trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more
efficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests
and let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow
from old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds
deliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice
assisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses
that compete with saplings, preventing grazing,
and even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees
in the wrong places. It’s bad when it’s mistakenly used
as a catch-all solution, rather than addressing more
complex issues like carbon emissions and active deforestation. It’s also bad to plant trees when it
allows companies and governments to practice greenwashing, throwing money at initiatives that
have no real chance of achieving the carbon offsets they promise. The best investments in a greener future
are to cut carbon emissions, while protecting these forests from being
destroyed in the first place.

**Transcript**:
Navigating an icy road can be pretty dangerous. And while applying a coating of 
salt is the time-tested method for rendering a frozen highway 
drivable, that salt has major downsides. It’s toxic for plants, wildlife 
and freshwater ecosystems. It contaminates our drinking 
water and air quality. It can even damage our cars, which, 
like, feels a bit counter-productive. So, how do we make winter roads safe 
for both drivers and the environment? Well, science says we have options. [♪ INTRO] Salting a road is by far the 
most common de-icing technique. When salt mixes with water, the resulting solution has a lower freezing temperature 
than water by itself. However, this is true for all kinds 
of solutions, not just salty ones. Thanks to a scientific principle 
called freezing point depression, the temperature at which 
plain H2O freezes is always higher than its freezing point when 
something is dissolved into it. Essentially, the salt keeps water 
molecules from forming solid ice crystals because the salt interrupts 
the watery ice structure. The temperature at which the 
salty water eventually freezes depends on how salty the solution is. And although salting roads with the 
classic sodium chloride is effective, it wreaks havoc on plants and wildlife, 
contributes to poor air, soil and water quality, ruins infrastructure like water 
treatment plants and bridges, and corrodes our stuff (like the steel in cars). Which is why some places are experimenting with a few solutions to this chilly conundrum. We can start simple: even a different 
kind of salt can make a difference! The sodium chloride you put on your food 
is chemically the same as the rock salt, or halite, that's spread on roads to melt ice. It's cheap, effective, and the infrastructure for delivering it to roads is already in place. The problem is that the 
chlorides in the sodium chloride don't ever break down in the environment. But other salts are better for the environment, if only because less is required 
in solution to achieve the same freezing point depression we get with a 
higher concentration of sodium chloride. Remember, a salt is just any compound 
that has positive and negative ions, which together make a neutral charge. There are a lot of options 
for what salts you can use. For instance, magnesium 
chloride and calcium chloride lower the freezing point more effectively 
due to some interesting chemistry. When sodium chloride dissolves in water, 
it dissociates into two ions: Na+ and Cl-. Magnesium chloride and calcium 
chloride, on the other hand, dissociate into three ions 
each, since they’re each made of three total atoms instead of the two in NaCl. And because the number of 
dissolved particles in a solution is what determines how low the 
freezing point of a solution can get, salts like calcium chloride can do 
the same job as sodium chloride, while using less raw salt to do it. Some states like Connecticut have used 
magnesium chloride salts for de-icing, citing the lower cost of the solution. However, there is a downside: they’re 
still somewhat corrosive to cars, making them less than ideal. And these salts are also bad for the 
environment when they accumulate; it just doesn't happen as 
fast as with sodium chloride, because less is needed to do the job. Figuring out which ions react with 
what can be a major chemistry puzzle. And you can find more of those at 
Brilliant, the online learning platform with thousands of lessons in 
science, computer science, and math, and the sponsor for this video. Their Chemistry and Biology Puzzles 
course takes interactive learning to the next level with 28 quick lessons

like finding a cleaner burning fuel. You can try them all for free for 
30 days at Brilliant.org/SciShow or by clicking the link in 
the description down below. That link also gives you 20% off an 
annual premium Brilliant subscription. So, if your ears perked up at the 
mere mention of the environment, just wait until you hear about 
this next de-icing alternative. Of course, there are other options 
beyond salts for de-icing roads. Some state road agencies have 
tested all kinds of weird stuff: cheese brine, pickle juice, beet 
juice and pig pee, to name a few. Welcome to the wild world of potentially 
eco-friendly methods for melting road ice! Byproducts from vodka distilleries or 
sugar beet processing facilities contain a lot of sugars, which, when added to 
road salts, helps lower the melting point of the ice, meaning the salt will work 
better at even lower temperatures. But not all eco-options are created equal. For instance, some communities have 
complained about the smell from that beet wastewater, and some research 
shows that distillery byproducts can also cause some of those ecosystem 
problems that we’re trying to avoid. Urea is also marketed as an eco-friendly 
solution to road salt, since it’s also water-soluble and makes a solution with 
a lower freezing point than pure water. And while urea is great at 
de-icing and is generally safe for pets and children to be around, 
there are some downsides. It doesn't perform well below - 4 degrees 
celsius and once it gets into a waterway, it decreases dissolved oxygen 
and causes algal blooms. ~ Plus, urea is actually somewhat expensive, at least compared to the other options out there. Still, there’s definitely a market for more 
of these less harmful options for de-icing. The other way to help de-ice our roads 
is also the way to make pickles - brine. But I’m not talking about 
your leftover pickle juice! Brine is just water that’s got a lot of 
salts dissolved in it, and using brine on the roads is a pretty neat way to prevent 
the ice from forming in the first place. When you de-ice a road that's already 
been snowed upon, transportation agencies use wet rock salt to break the bond between the ice and the road, making it safer to drive. But the idea behind the brine is to apply 
liquid salt to the road ahead of time. Some places have started brining the roads with liquid salt solution before 
the snow or ice shows up. This limits the amount of ice that 
can form on the road to begin with, and uses about a quarter of the salt of de-icing. Brining requires a lot of infrastructure 
and planning; a community needs trucks with big tanks and pumps to spray 
the brine onto the pavement surface. This stuff can be expensive. However, communities that have 
invested in brining roads have reported reducing the overall cost of maintaining 
winter roads, even after accounting for the extra equipment and staffing. And the reason for the savings is simple: 
they're just not buying as much salt! So, while nothing is perfect, there are 
absolutely some ways we can move ahead on making our roads safer and more eco-friendly. Let’s just hope they don’t all smell like pig pee. Thanks for watching! [♪ OUTRO]

better at even lower temperatures. But not all eco-options are created equal. For instance, some communities have 
complained about the smell from that beet wastewater, and some research 
shows that distillery byproducts can also cause some of those ecosystem 
problems that we’re trying to avoid. Urea is also marketed as an eco-friendly 
solution to road salt, since it’s also water-soluble and makes a solution with 
a lower freezing point than pure water. And while urea is great at 
de-icing and is generally safe for pets and children to be around, 
there are some downsides. It doesn't perform well below - 4 degrees 
celsius and once it gets into a waterway, it decreases dissolved oxygen 
and causes algal blooms. ~ Plus, urea is actually somewhat expensive, at least compared to the other options out there. Still, there’s definitely a market for more 
of these less harmful options for de-icing. The other way to help de-ice our roads 
is also the way to make pickles - brine. But I’m not talking about 
your leftover pickle juice! Brine is just water that’s got a lot of 
salts dissolved in it, and using brine on the roads is a pretty neat way to prevent 
the ice from forming in the first place. When you de-ice a road that's already 
been snowed upon, transportation agencies use wet rock salt to break the bond between the ice and the road, making it safer to drive. But the idea behind the brine is to apply 
liquid salt to the road ahead of time. Some places have started brining the roads with liquid salt solution before 
the snow or ice shows up. This limits the amount of ice that 
can form on the road to begin with, and uses about a quarter of the salt of de-icing. Brining requires a lot of infrastructure 
and planning; a community needs trucks with big tanks and pumps to spray 
the brine onto the pavement surface. This stuff can be expensive. However, communities that have 
invested in brining roads have reported reducing the overall cost of maintaining 
winter roads, even after accounting for the extra equipment and staffing. And the reason for the savings is simple: 
they're just not buying as much salt! So, while nothing is perfect, there are 
absolutely some ways we can move ahead on making our roads safer and more eco-friendly. Let’s just hope they don’t all smell like pig pee. Thanks for watching! [♪ OUTRO]

**Transcript**:
Navigating an icy road can be pretty dangerous. And while applying a coating of 
salt is the time-tested method for rendering a frozen highway 
drivable, that salt has major downsides. It’s toxic for plants, wildlife 
and freshwater ecosystems. It contaminates our drinking 
water and air quality. It can even damage our cars, which, 
like, feels a bit counter-productive. So, how do we make winter roads safe 
for both drivers and the environment? Well, science says we have options. [♪ INTRO] Salting a road is by far the 
most common de-icing technique. When salt mixes with water, the resulting solution has a lower freezing temperature 
than water by itself. However, this is true for all kinds 
of solutions, not just salty ones. Thanks to a scientific principle 
called freezing point depression, the temperature at which 
plain H2O freezes is always higher than its freezing point when 
something is dissolved into it. Essentially, the salt keeps water 
molecules from forming solid ice crystals because the salt interrupts 
the watery ice structure. The temperature at which the 
salty water eventually freezes depends on how salty the solution is. And although salting roads with the 
classic sodium chloride is effective, it wreaks havoc on plants and wildlife, 
contributes to poor air, soil and water quality, ruins infrastructure like water 
treatment plants and bridges, and corrodes our stuff (like the steel in cars). Which is why some places are experimenting with a few solutions to this chilly conundrum. We can start simple: even a different 
kind of salt can make a difference! The sodium chloride you put on your food 
is chemically the same as the rock salt, or halite, that's spread on roads to melt ice. It's cheap, effective, and the infrastructure for delivering it to roads is already in place. The problem is that the 
chlorides in the sodium chloride don't ever break down in the environment. But other salts are better for the environment, if only because less is required 
in solution to achieve the same freezing point depression we get with a 
higher concentration of sodium chloride. Remember, a salt is just any compound 
that has positive and negative ions, which together make a neutral charge. There are a lot of options 
for what salts you can use. For instance, magnesium 
chloride and calcium chloride lower the freezing point more effectively 
due to some interesting chemistry. When sodium chloride dissolves in water, 
it dissociates into two ions: Na+ and Cl-. Magnesium chloride and calcium 
chloride, on the other hand, dissociate into three ions 
each, since they’re each made of three total atoms instead of the two in NaCl. And because the number of 
dissolved particles in a solution is what determines how low the 
freezing point of a solution can get, salts like calcium chloride can do 
the same job as sodium chloride, while using less raw salt to do it. Some states like Connecticut have used 
magnesium chloride salts for de-icing, citing the lower cost of the solution. However, there is a downside: they’re 
still somewhat corrosive to cars, making them less than ideal. And these salts are also bad for the 
environment when they accumulate; it just doesn't happen as 
fast as with sodium chloride, because less is needed to do the job. Figuring out which ions react with 
what can be a major chemistry puzzle. And you can find more of those at 
Brilliant, the online learning platform with thousands of lessons in 
science, computer science, and math, and the sponsor for this video. Their Chemistry and Biology Puzzles

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1800s, soon after American whaling ships
began operating in the North Pacific, an interesting trend emerged. Whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful
strikes within just a few years. Sperm whales in the region had
suddenly become much harder to kill. Generally, when predators
like orcas are nearby, sperm whales protect their most vulnerable by forming defensive circles
at the surface. But this behavior made them
susceptible to whaling ships. It seems that sperm whales
in the North Pacific were somehow able to quickly
adapt to this reality. Groups that likely hadn’t yet experienced
human attacks began escaping whaling boats
on fast currents instead of forming defensive circles. And, based on what we’re starting
to understand about sperm whales, it seems possible they were actually
broadcasting survival strategies to one another. Indeed, unbeknownst to whalers, spermaceti, the material they killed for, is an essential part of the sperm whale’s
sophisticated communication and echolocation system. This waxy substance fills a cavity
in the sperm whale’s head. And their head is mostly comprised
of an expanded nose that serves as a highly calibrated
sonar system. Sperm whales generate some of the loudest
biological noises on record, communicate copiously using
an array of complex vocalization styles, and have the largest brains on Earth. They spend most of their time searching
the ocean's depths for prey. They can stay submerged for over an hour,
and dive deeper than 1,200 meters, far beyond sunlight’s reach,
where they’re guided by sound. The loudest noise recorded underwater
is around 270 decibels. Sperm whale-generated sounds
can reach 230. And they frequently fix
their high-intensity echolocation clicks on squid. Some of the air they inhale through their
blowhole is routed into their lungs, while the rest enters a complex,
sound-producing system. There, air is funneled through lip-like
appendages at the front of their heads. This generates a sound that travels
backwards through their spermaceti organ, bounces off an air sac,
then traverses another waxy organ, which amplifies and directs the sound. The click exits the sperm whale’s head
a powerful, focused beam. It’s suspected that
the returning vibrations are received by the whale’s lower jaw
and directed into the ears. Then, their brain’s expanded
auditory processing region analyzes the quality of the echoes
to map their surroundings in the darkness. With this mechanism, sperm whales
can locate squid 300 meters away. Scientists think squid don’t hear
these high-frequency clicks— even as they turn into rapid buzzes
and creaks as the whale closes in. Sperm whales can eat more than a ton
of squid every day. Their stomachs and feces are usually
full of indigestible squid beaks, and their skin often scarred
by squid tentacles. When they're not hunting, however, sperm whales use an entirely
different vocal repertoire. Mature males make clang noises, which scientists suspect play a role
in mating. And most other sperm whales live
in social family groups. Though their communication might get
interrupted when predators are near or human-generated noises dominate, they generally chatter at length
at the water’s surface. Sperm whales do this using patterned click
sequences akin to Morse code, called codas, which are thought to function
as social identity markers. Researchers have identified dozens
of distinct types of codas, according to patterns in the numbers
of clicks used and their rhythm and tempo. Some codas are more ubiquitous, while others vary greatly according
to family groups and individuals. All families in a given region that consistently use some of the same
characteristic coda patterns share a dialect
and belong to the same vocal clan. Each sperm whale calf goes
through a multi-year period of babbling, where they experiment
with different sounds before becoming fluent
in their clan’s coda dialect. How and what exactly sperm whales
communicate to each other is currently unknown, but there are indications that the
information can be sophisticated. Biologists, roboticists, linguists,
cryptographers, and artificial intelligence experts are collaborating to monitor and analyze
sperm whale vocalizations. The aim is to finally decipher
what they're saying.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1800s, soon after American whaling ships
began operating in the North Pacific, an interesting trend emerged. Whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful
strikes within just a few years. Sperm whales in the region had
suddenly become much harder to kill. Generally, when predators
like orcas are nearby, sperm whales protect their most vulnerable by forming defensive circles
at the surface. But this behavior made them
susceptible to whaling ships. It seems that sperm whales
in the North Pacific were somehow able to quickly
adapt to this reality. Groups that likely hadn’t yet experienced
human attacks began escaping whaling boats
on fast currents instead of forming defensive circles. And, based on what we’re starting
to understand about sperm whales, it seems possible they were actually
broadcasting survival strategies to one another. Indeed, unbeknownst to whalers, spermaceti, the material they killed for, is an essential part of the sperm whale’s
sophisticated communication and echolocation system. This waxy substance fills a cavity
in the sperm whale’s head. And their head is mostly comprised
of an expanded nose that serves as a highly calibrated
sonar system. Sperm whales generate some of the loudest
biological noises on record, communicate copiously using
an array of complex vocalization styles, and have the largest brains on Earth. They spend most of their time searching
the ocean's depths for prey. They can stay submerged for over an hour,
and dive deeper than 1,200 meters, far beyond sunlight’s reach,
where they’re guided by sound. The loudest noise recorded underwater
is around 270 decibels. Sperm whale-generated sounds
can reach 230. And they frequently fix
their high-intensity echolocation clicks on squid. Some of the air they inhale through their
blowhole is routed into their lungs, while the rest enters a complex,
sound-producing system. There, air is funneled through lip-like
appendages at the front of their heads. This generates a sound that travels
backwards through their spermaceti organ, bounces off an air sac,
then traverses another waxy organ, which amplifies and directs the sound. The click exits the sperm whale’s head
a powerful, focused beam. It’s suspected that
the returning vibrations are received by the whale’s lower jaw
and directed into the ears. Then, their brain’s expanded
auditory processing region analyzes the quality of the echoes
to map their surroundings in the darkness. With this mechanism, sperm whales
can locate squid 300 meters away. Scientists think squid don’t hear
these high-frequency clicks— even as they turn into rapid buzzes
and creaks as the whale closes in. Sperm whales can eat more than a ton
of squid every day. Their stomachs and feces are usually
full of indigestible squid beaks, and their skin often scarred
by squid tentacles. When they're not hunting, however, sperm whales use an entirely
different vocal repertoire. Mature males make clang noises, which scientists suspect play a role
in mating. And most other sperm whales live
in social family groups. Though their communication might get
interrupted when predators are near or human-generated noises dominate, they generally chatter at length
at the water’s surface. Sperm whales do this using patterned click
sequences akin to Morse code, called codas, which are thought to function
as social identity markers. Researchers have identified dozens
of distinct types of codas, according to patterns in the numbers
of clicks used and their rhythm and tempo. Some codas are more ubiquitous, while others vary greatly according
to family groups and individuals. All families in a given region that consistently use some of the same
characteristic coda patterns share a dialect
and belong to the same vocal clan. Each sperm whale calf goes
through a multi-year period of babbling, where they experiment
with different sounds before becoming fluent
in their clan’s coda dialect. How and what exactly sperm whales
communicate to each other is currently unknown, but there are indications that the
information can be sophisticated. Biologists, roboticists, linguists,
cryptographers, and artificial intelligence experts are collaborating to monitor and analyze
sperm whale vocalizations. The aim is to finally decipher
what they're saying.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify a generated MCQ that shares some similarities with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a general characteristic of sperm whales, specifically that they are the largest-brained animal to ever live. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the most similar in terms of content, as it asks about a specific aspect of sperm whale biology (the spermaceti organ). However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent or options.

A closer match in terms of question intent is Question 8, but it is still not a good match in terms of content or options.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, although it is still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
Today is the annual Sly Wizard Tournament
featuring competitors from the wizarding world’s
three greatest schools, and you’ve been entrusted
with an enormous responsibility. You are to administer the tournament. First, you and you alone will determine
how many events there will be and their scoring system. Then the three wizards will
enter your maze and compete in your chosen
events in utmost secrecy; only you and they will see what happens. The competition begins and... Wow, that was one for the record books. The winner was... wait, you have no idea. The last thing you remember was
a dark wizard showing up and casting a forgetting curse. The competitors seem even more confused—
each is convinced they won. This is bad. There can be no do-overs, and the last failure to declare a winner
set off the first Great Wizarding War. You’ve got to figure this out— and fast. But for the life of you,
you can’t remember a thing. You know you had to follow a few rules: there had to be three or more events,
each with a single winner and loser. Every event used the same scoring system, where first place received more points
than second, and second more than third. All points were positive integers. Maybe there’s a record somewhere...
oh, of course, your scorecard. Well, that leaves something to be desired. All that you wrote down was
that in Calchemy, Newt-niz won,
Leib-ton took second, and that was the only time
Magnificent Marigold’s Magical Macademy got third all day. Oh, and some final scores: one school got 22 points,
and both of the others got 9. Why are you so bad at taking notes?! No time for self-recrimination. The wizarding world is waiting. Who won the tournament? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 At first, it may seem like there are
an overwhelming number of possible scoring systems, so let's see if we can narrow our options. We can start by looking for clues
in the total scores. Every event was scored the same way, so the sum of all points
in the entire tournament must be a multiple of one event’s total. In other words, if there were three events
that scored 3, 2, 1, which adds up to 6,
the total points for the day would be 18, which is three events times 6 points. Our total is 40. So we can make a table of possibilities:
one event totaling 40 points, two totaling 20, four totaling 10,
and so on. We know there were at least three events,
which eliminates these options, and we can also get rid of events
with fewer than 6 points, because the smallest possible total
is 3 plus 2 plus 1. That leaves two prospects. Let’s try to narrow those further
by breaking down the possible points earned in each event: if first place received 7 points, the teams that had totals of 9
couldn’t have won an event because their total score
would be 10 or more. That means the team with 22
would have to have won all four. But then their total would be 28,
so we can eliminate that option. And with four events, these numbers
can't be made to add up to 22. Finally, if first place got 5 points, the highest possible score 
with four events would be 20, getting rid of these two as well. In fact, five events scoring 4 each
could only reach 20 as well. That leaves us with just one possibility: five events each scored 5, 2, 1. There’s exactly one way to make
those scores add up to 22: the winner finished first
four times and second once. The scores of 9 mean one team won once
and lost four times, and the other lost once

was Calchemy based on your note. And Leib-ton’s second place finish
in Calchemy means they scored 22 and won the Sly Wizard Tournament. You have just enough evidence to prove it,
keep your job, and avert war. Phew!

**Transcript**:
Today is the annual Sly Wizard Tournament
featuring competitors from the wizarding world’s
three greatest schools, and you’ve been entrusted
with an enormous responsibility. You are to administer the tournament. First, you and you alone will determine
how many events there will be and their scoring system. Then the three wizards will
enter your maze and compete in your chosen
events in utmost secrecy; only you and they will see what happens. The competition begins and... Wow, that was one for the record books. The winner was... wait, you have no idea. The last thing you remember was
a dark wizard showing up and casting a forgetting curse. The competitors seem even more confused—
each is convinced they won. This is bad. There can be no do-overs, and the last failure to declare a winner
set off the first Great Wizarding War. You’ve got to figure this out— and fast. But for the life of you,
you can’t remember a thing. You know you had to follow a few rules: there had to be three or more events,
each with a single winner and loser. Every event used the same scoring system, where first place received more points
than second, and second more than third. All points were positive integers. Maybe there’s a record somewhere...
oh, of course, your scorecard. Well, that leaves something to be desired. All that you wrote down was
that in Calchemy, Newt-niz won,
Leib-ton took second, and that was the only time
Magnificent Marigold’s Magical Macademy got third all day. Oh, and some final scores: one school got 22 points,
and both of the others got 9. Why are you so bad at taking notes?! No time for self-recrimination. The wizarding world is waiting. Who won the tournament? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 At first, it may seem like there are
an overwhelming number of possible scoring systems, so let's see if we can narrow our options. We can start by looking for clues
in the total scores. Every event was scored the same way, so the sum of all points
in the entire tournament must be a multiple of one event’s total. In other words, if there were three events
that scored 3, 2, 1, which adds up to 6,
the total points for the day would be 18, which is three events times 6 points. Our total is 40. So we can make a table of possibilities:
one event totaling 40 points, two totaling 20, four totaling 10,
and so on. We know there were at least three events,
which eliminates these options, and we can also get rid of events
with fewer than 6 points, because the smallest possible total
is 3 plus 2 plus 1. That leaves two prospects. Let’s try to narrow those further
by breaking down the possible points earned in each event: if first place received 7 points, the teams that had totals of 9
couldn’t have won an event because their total score
would be 10 or more. That means the team with 22
would have to have won all four. But then their total would be 28,
so we can eliminate that option. And with four events, these numbers
can't be made to add up to 22. Finally, if first place got 5 points, the highest possible score 
with four events would be 20, getting rid of these two as well. In fact, five events scoring 4 each
could only reach 20 as well. That leaves us with just one possibility: five events each scored 5, 2, 1. There’s exactly one way to make
those scores add up to 22: the winner finished first
four times and second once. The scores of 9 mean one team won once
and lost four times, and the other lost once
and took second four times. That must be Marigold’s Macademy, whose only third place finish
was Calchemy based on your note. And Leib-ton’s second place finish
in Calchemy means they scored 22 and won the Sly Wizard Tournament. You have just enough evidence to prove it,

**Transcript**:
The following statement
is utterly ludicrous. It is also true. The world's most important
advanced technology is nearly all produced
in a single facility. What's more, that facility is located in one of the most geopolitically
fraught areas on Earth, an area in which many analysts believe
that war is inevitable within the decade. The future of artificial intelligence
hangs in the balance. The Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, makes all of the world's
most-advanced AI chips. This includes Nvidia's GPUs,
Google's TPUs, AMD's GPUs, the AI chips for Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Cerebrus, SambaNova and every other credible competitor. Modern artificial intelligence
simply would not be possible without these highly specialized chips. Little wonder, then, that Time magazine recently
described TSMC as, "The world's most important company
that you've probably never heard of." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
put it more colorfully, saying, “Basically,
there is air ... and TSMC.” (Laughter) TSMC's chip fabrication
facilities, or fabs, the buildings where chips
are physically built, is located on the western coast of Taiwan, a mere 110 miles from mainland China. In this map, Taiwan is shown in orange
and China is shown in green. Today, China and Taiwan
are nearer to the brink of war than they have been in decades. Many policymakers in Washington predict
that China will invade Taiwan within the next five years. A China-Taiwan conflict
would be devastating for many reasons. Aside from the heavy human toll, one underappreciated consequence is that it would paralyze
the global AI ecosystem. Put simply, the entire field
of artificial intelligence faces an astonishingly precarious
single point of failure in Taiwan. Amid all of the fervor around AI today, this fact is not widely
enough appreciated. If you are working on
or are interested in AI, you need to be paying attention. How did we get here
and what can we do about it? Let's start with a brief, whirlwind
overview of the chip industry. Semiconductors, or chips,
are the most complex object in the world that humanity knows how to mass-produce. Making semiconductors requires
the world's purest metals, the world's most expensive machinery, legions of highly specialized engineers and atom-level manufacturing precision. It is important to distinguish between two
different types of chip companies. First, fabless chip makers, which design but do not
manufacture their own chips. And second, foundries, which manufacture chips
designed by other companies. Almost every well-known chip
company today is fabless, from Nvidia to AMD to Qualcomm. These companies do not
produce their own chips. Instead, they design chips, and then they rely on foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture
those chips for them. There are only three companies
in the world today that are capable of manufacturing chips anywhere near the leading edge
of semiconductor technology: TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Of those three, only one can reliably produce
the world's most advanced AI chips, including chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs. That one company is TSMC. As of this morning, TSMC's market capitalization
was 470 billion dollars, making it the 13th-largest
company in the world, larger than ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Walmart. How has TSMC become such a dominant force? The short answer is that powerful
economies of scale exist in the world of chip fabrication, leading inexorably
to winner-take-all dynamics. Making advanced semiconductors
requires tremendous upfront and ongoing capital expenditure. In 2021, TSMC announced
that it would invest 100 billion dollars over the next three years to continue expanding
its fabrication capabilities. No other company in the world
can justify that level of investment. TSMC can, because of the sheer volume
of chips that it produces, far more than any other
company in the world. A related dynamic that helps explain
TSMC's unassailable position is what has come to be known
as the TSMC Grand Alliance. TSMC has invested heavily over decades to develop deep partnerships
with dozens of companies across the semiconductor supply chain, from software providers like Cadence to equipment manufacturers like ASML to chip designers like Nvidia. In turn, these companies
have developed their own products in accordance with TSMC's road map, leading to powerful lock-in. In summary, a combination
of economies of scale, network effects, and unrivaled specialization
have made TSMC irreplaceable and have made the entire world deeply,
precariously dependent upon it. This brings us to the present,
delicate geopolitical moment. Last October, the Biden administration
took the dramatic step of banning the export of all high-end
AI chips to any entity in China. The rationale behind
these measures was clear. To leverage US control of the global semiconductor supply chain as a choke point to handicap
China's AI capabilities. The US government is currently formulating
expansions to this policy. At the same time, the US is taking steps
to reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities
located in East Asia. In late 2022, TSMC announced that it would
invest 40 billion dollars to build two new state-of-the-art fabs in the United States, in Arizona. The first of these two fabs is slated
to begin production in 2025. Bringing advanced
chip production to US soil will help mitigate the AI industry's
absolute dependence on Taiwan-based fabs. But the Arizona fabs
will not solve everything. Their production capacity will be modest, representing less than five percent
of TSMC's total global output. And the most advanced semiconductor
production capabilities and technologies will remain in Taiwan. So where might things go from here? Let's briefly consider
a few possibilities on this three-dimensional chessboard. Let's start with optimistic scenario. Taiwan's central role in the global
semiconductor industry is often referred to
as its “silicon shield.” The basic theory is this: because China depends so heavily on Taiwan
for the chips that it needs to keep its own economy running, China will stop short of invading Taiwan
and putting TSMC's production at risk. And because the rest of the world
is likewise so dependent on TSMC, the United States and other powers
will go to great lengths to protect the island
and defend its sovereignty. Under this theory, while China may continue
to build out its military and engage in cross-strait saber-rattling, it will stop short of kinetic
action against Taiwan. But the silicon shield is just a theory, not a guarantee. What would happen if China
were to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly
be rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,
or even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this
valuable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings
were to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be
able to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global
semiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,
equipment and services. These would be denied
to an invading power. Let me say this one more time: if or when China invades Taiwan, TSMC's fabs will,
in all likelihood, go offline. This will mean that no more Nvidia H100s or any other cutting-edge AI chips will be able to be produced
anywhere in the world. What would this mean for the world of AI? After TSMC, the company
best positioned to step up and produce cutting-edge
AI chips is Samsung. Samsung is currently the only company
in the world, other than TSMC, that is capable of producing
three-nanometer chips, today's cutting-edge technology. But Samsung's production capabilities
are far inferior to TSMC's today. In a best-case scenario, it would take Samsung years to scale up to TSMC's current AI
chip yields and volumes. This brings us to America's
former chip champion, Intel. It was hardly a decade ago that Intel's chip-manufacturing
capabilities were the envy of the world. But in recent years,
Intel has fallen behind. The company struggled mightily
in its transition to both ten-nanometer and seven-nanometer node technologies, even resorting to outsourcing some
of its leading edge production to TSMC. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel aspires to regain
its chipmaking supremacy with an ambitious plan to leapfrog TSMC and begin producing
two-nanometer chips in 2024. Whether this ambitious plan will actually
prove achievable, however, remains to be seen. Before we despair too much, let us note a couple encouraging points. First, keep in mind that a considerable
stock of AI chips already exists in the world. And even in a worst-case scenario,
these chips would remain in use. Second, while the most advanced AI chips,
like Google’s TPUs or Nvidia’s H100s, can only be manufactured in Taiwan, there are many fabs around the world, from the US to Europe to Israel, that are capable of producing
lagging-edge logic chips at scale. Though they are far less powerful
than today's leading AI chips, these previous-generation chips
could be used in a pinch to support some AI computing workloads. Ultimately, though, it would be
devastating for humanity to lose its ability to produce the chips that power today's cutting-edge
artificial intelligence. Progress in AI would be
profoundly disrupted. Let us hope that diplomacy prevails. (Applause)

The following statement
is utterly ludicrous. It is also true. The world's most important
advanced technology is nearly all produced
in a single facility. What's more, that facility is located in one of the most geopolitically
fraught areas on Earth, an area in which many analysts believe
that war is inevitable within the decade. The future of artificial intelligence
hangs in the balance. The Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, makes all of the world's
most-advanced AI chips. This includes Nvidia's GPUs,
Google's TPUs, AMD's GPUs, the AI chips for Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla, Cerebrus, SambaNova and every other credible competitor. Modern artificial intelligence
simply would not be possible without these highly specialized chips. Little wonder, then, that Time magazine recently
described TSMC as, "The world's most important company
that you've probably never heard of." Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang
put it more colorfully, saying, “Basically,
there is air ... and TSMC.” (Laughter) TSMC's chip fabrication
facilities, or fabs, the buildings where chips
are physically built, is located on the western coast of Taiwan, a mere 110 miles from mainland China. In this map, Taiwan is shown in orange
and China is shown in green. Today, China and Taiwan
are nearer to the brink of war than they have been in decades. Many policymakers in Washington predict
that China will invade Taiwan within the next five years. A China-Taiwan conflict
would be devastating for many reasons. Aside from the heavy human toll, one underappreciated consequence is that it would paralyze
the global AI ecosystem. Put simply, the entire field
of artificial intelligence faces an astonishingly precarious
single point of failure in Taiwan. Amid all of the fervor around AI today, this fact is not widely
enough appreciated. If you are working on
or are interested in AI, you need to be paying attention. How did we get here
and what can we do about it? Let's start with a brief, whirlwind
overview of the chip industry. Semiconductors, or chips,
are the most complex object in the world that humanity knows how to mass-produce. Making semiconductors requires
the world's purest metals, the world's most expensive machinery, legions of highly specialized engineers and atom-level manufacturing precision. It is important to distinguish between two
different types of chip companies. First, fabless chip makers, which design but do not
manufacture their own chips. And second, foundries, which manufacture chips
designed by other companies. Almost every well-known chip
company today is fabless, from Nvidia to AMD to Qualcomm. These companies do not
produce their own chips. Instead, they design chips, and then they rely on foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture
those chips for them. There are only three companies
in the world today that are capable of manufacturing chips anywhere near the leading edge
of semiconductor technology: TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Of those three, only one can reliably produce
the world's most advanced AI chips, including chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs. That one company is TSMC. As of this morning, TSMC's market capitalization
was 470 billion dollars, making it the 13th-largest
company in the world, larger than ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Walmart. How has TSMC become such a dominant force? The short answer is that powerful
economies of scale exist in the world of chip fabrication, leading inexorably
to winner-take-all dynamics. Making advanced semiconductors
requires tremendous upfront and ongoing capital expenditure. In 2021, TSMC announced
that it would invest 100 billion dollars over the next three years to continue expanding
its fabrication capabilities. No other company in the world
can justify that level of investment. TSMC can, because of the sheer volume
of chips that it produces, far more than any other
company in the world. A related dynamic that helps explain
TSMC's unassailable position is what has come to be known
as the TSMC Grand Alliance. TSMC has invested heavily over decades to develop deep partnerships
with dozens of companies across the semiconductor supply chain, from software providers like Cadence to equipment manufacturers like ASML to chip designers like Nvidia. In turn, these companies
have developed their own products in accordance with TSMC's road map, leading to powerful lock-in. In summary, a combination
of economies of scale, network effects, and unrivaled specialization
have made TSMC irreplaceable and have made the entire world deeply,
precariously dependent upon it. This brings us to the present,
delicate geopolitical moment. Last October, the Biden administration
took the dramatic step of banning the export of all high-end
AI chips to any entity in China. The rationale behind
these measures was clear. To leverage US control of the global semiconductor supply chain as a choke point to handicap
China's AI capabilities. The US government is currently formulating
expansions to this policy. At the same time, the US is taking steps
to reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities
located in East Asia. In late 2022, TSMC announced that it would
invest 40 billion dollars to build two new state-of-the-art fabs in the United States, in Arizona. The first of these two fabs is slated
to begin production in 2025. Bringing advanced
chip production to US soil will help mitigate the AI industry's
absolute dependence on Taiwan-based fabs. But the Arizona fabs
will not solve everything. Their production capacity will be modest, representing less than five percent
of TSMC's total global output. And the most advanced semiconductor
production capabilities and technologies will remain in Taiwan. So where might things go from here? Let's briefly consider
a few possibilities on this three-dimensional chessboard. Let's start with optimistic scenario. Taiwan's central role in the global
semiconductor industry is often referred to
as its “silicon shield.” The basic theory is this: because China depends so heavily on Taiwan
for the chips that it needs to keep its own economy running, China will stop short of invading Taiwan
and putting TSMC's production at risk. And because the rest of the world
is likewise so dependent on TSMC, the United States and other powers
will go to great lengths to protect the island
and defend its sovereignty. Under this theory, while China may continue
to build out its military and engage in cross-strait saber-rattling, it will stop short of kinetic
action against Taiwan. But the silicon shield is just a theory, not a guarantee. What would happen if China
were to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly
be rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,
or even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this
valuable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings
were to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be
able to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global
semiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,

are physically built, is located on the western coast of Taiwan, a mere 110 miles from mainland China. In this map, Taiwan is shown in orange
and China is shown in green. Today, China and Taiwan
are nearer to the brink of war than they have been in decades. Many policymakers in Washington predict
that China will invade Taiwan within the next five years. A China-Taiwan conflict
would be devastating for many reasons. Aside from the heavy human toll, one underappreciated consequence is that it would paralyze
the global AI ecosystem. Put simply, the entire field
of artificial intelligence faces an astonishingly precarious
single point of failure in Taiwan. Amid all of the fervor around AI today, this fact is not widely
enough appreciated. If you are working on
or are interested in AI, you need to be paying attention. How did we get here
and what can we do about it? Let's start with a brief, whirlwind
overview of the chip industry. Semiconductors, or chips,
are the most complex object in the world that humanity knows how to mass-produce. Making semiconductors requires
the world's purest metals, the world's most expensive machinery, legions of highly specialized engineers and atom-level manufacturing precision. It is important to distinguish between two
different types of chip companies. First, fabless chip makers, which design but do not
manufacture their own chips. And second, foundries, which manufacture chips
designed by other companies. Almost every well-known chip
company today is fabless, from Nvidia to AMD to Qualcomm. These companies do not
produce their own chips. Instead, they design chips, and then they rely on foundries like TSMC to actually manufacture
those chips for them. There are only three companies
in the world today that are capable of manufacturing chips anywhere near the leading edge
of semiconductor technology: TSMC, Samsung and Intel. Of those three, only one can reliably produce
the world's most advanced AI chips, including chips like Nvidia's H100 GPUs. That one company is TSMC. As of this morning, TSMC's market capitalization
was 470 billion dollars, making it the 13th-largest
company in the world, larger than ExxonMobil, JPMorgan Chase or Walmart. How has TSMC become such a dominant force? The short answer is that powerful
economies of scale exist in the world of chip fabrication, leading inexorably
to winner-take-all dynamics. Making advanced semiconductors
requires tremendous upfront and ongoing capital expenditure. In 2021, TSMC announced
that it would invest 100 billion dollars over the next three years to continue expanding
its fabrication capabilities. No other company in the world
can justify that level of investment. TSMC can, because of the sheer volume
of chips that it produces, far more than any other
company in the world. A related dynamic that helps explain
TSMC's unassailable position is what has come to be known
as the TSMC Grand Alliance. TSMC has invested heavily over decades to develop deep partnerships
with dozens of companies across the semiconductor supply chain, from software providers like Cadence to equipment manufacturers like ASML to chip designers like Nvidia. In turn, these companies
have developed their own products in accordance with TSMC's road map, leading to powerful lock-in. In summary, a combination
of economies of scale, network effects, and unrivaled specialization
have made TSMC irreplaceable and have made the entire world deeply,
precariously dependent upon it. This brings us to the present,
delicate geopolitical moment. Last October, the Biden administration
took the dramatic step of banning the export of all high-end
AI chips to any entity in China. The rationale behind
these measures was clear. To leverage US control of the global semiconductor supply chain as a choke point to handicap
China's AI capabilities. The US government is currently formulating
expansions to this policy. At the same time, the US is taking steps
to reduce its reliance on chip fabrication facilities
located in East Asia. In late 2022, TSMC announced that it would
invest 40 billion dollars to build two new state-of-the-art fabs in the United States, in Arizona. The first of these two fabs is slated
to begin production in 2025. Bringing advanced
chip production to US soil will help mitigate the AI industry's
absolute dependence on Taiwan-based fabs. But the Arizona fabs
will not solve everything. Their production capacity will be modest, representing less than five percent
of TSMC's total global output. And the most advanced semiconductor
production capabilities and technologies will remain in Taiwan. So where might things go from here? Let's briefly consider
a few possibilities on this three-dimensional chessboard. Let's start with optimistic scenario. Taiwan's central role in the global
semiconductor industry is often referred to
as its “silicon shield.” The basic theory is this: because China depends so heavily on Taiwan
for the chips that it needs to keep its own economy running, China will stop short of invading Taiwan
and putting TSMC's production at risk. And because the rest of the world
is likewise so dependent on TSMC, the United States and other powers
will go to great lengths to protect the island
and defend its sovereignty. Under this theory, while China may continue
to build out its military and engage in cross-strait saber-rattling, it will stop short of kinetic
action against Taiwan. But the silicon shield is just a theory, not a guarantee. What would happen if China
were to move decisively to retake Taiwan? TSMC's fabs would almost certainly
be rendered inoperative. It is conceivable that the Taiwanese,
or even the US military, would preemptively destroy the fabs in order to prevent the CCP from taking control of this
valuable strategic resource. Even if the physical buildings
were to remain undamaged after a Chinese invasion, it is unrealistic that the CCP would be
able to continue operating the fabs to produce cutting-edge chips. Keeping leading edge fabs running requires ongoing and deep partnership with organizations across the global
semiconductor ecosystem, as well as a steady inflow of materials,
equipment and services. These would be denied
to an invading power. Let me say this one more time: if or when China invades Taiwan, TSMC's fabs will,
in all likelihood, go offline. This will mean that no more Nvidia H100s or any other cutting-edge AI chips will be able to be produced
anywhere in the world. What would this mean for the world of AI? After TSMC, the company
best positioned to step up and produce cutting-edge
AI chips is Samsung. Samsung is currently the only company
in the world, other than TSMC, that is capable of producing
three-nanometer chips, today's cutting-edge technology. But Samsung's production capabilities
are far inferior to TSMC's today. In a best-case scenario, it would take Samsung years to scale up to TSMC's current AI
chip yields and volumes. This brings us to America's
former chip champion, Intel. It was hardly a decade ago that Intel's chip-manufacturing
capabilities were the envy of the world. But in recent years,
Intel has fallen behind. The company struggled mightily
in its transition to both ten-nanometer and seven-nanometer node technologies, even resorting to outsourcing some
of its leading edge production to TSMC. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel aspires to regain
its chipmaking supremacy with an ambitious plan to leapfrog TSMC and begin producing
two-nanometer chips in 2024. Whether this ambitious plan will actually
prove achievable, however, remains to be seen. Before we despair too much, let us note a couple encouraging points. First, keep in mind that a considerable
stock of AI chips already exists in the world. And even in a worst-case scenario,
these chips would remain in use. Second, while the most advanced AI chips,
like Google’s TPUs or Nvidia’s H100s, can only be manufactured in Taiwan, there are many fabs around the world, from the US to Europe to Israel, that are capable of producing
lagging-edge logic chips at scale. Though they are far less powerful
than today's leading AI chips, these previous-generation chips
could be used in a pinch to support some AI computing workloads. Ultimately, though, it would be
devastating for humanity to lose its ability to produce the chips that power today's cutting-edge
artificial intelligence. Progress in AI would be
profoundly disrupted. Let us hope that diplomacy prevails. (Applause)

SciShow is supported by Brilliant.org. { ♪INTRO } The word “contagious” probably conjures
up all sorts of horrific images of Ebola or the
plague— diseases that have a reputation for gruesome, indiscriminate killing. So you might be surprised to hear that when it comes to the world’s most contagious diseases, those don’t even make the top 10. The winners on that list can be ten or more times as contagious as Ebola or the plague, and they aren’t off in some remote jungle or a thing of the past, either. They’re right here, right now. In fact, measles—that almost-eliminated virus now making headlines in places like Washington and New York— is one of the most contagious diseases we know of. And it’s contagiousness is a big part of why it’s making a resurgence. Now, the word “contagious” has a very specific meaning to epidemiologists —the scientists that study how diseases spread. A disease is considered especially contagious if one sick person is likely to infect a lot of other people. And that’s something that can be quantified. The average number of people a single sick person infects is known as a disease’s basic reproduction number or R0. R0 is based on a number of factors, like the rate of contact between infected and susceptible people how long an infected person is contagious, Probability that an uninfected person will contract the disease if they’re around someone who’s sick. Because of that, it’s not a fixed number— there are a lot of varibles that can impact how contagious a pathogen will be in a specific environment. So contagiousness can vary from location to location and outbreak to outbreak When R0 is less than 1, a disease is considered self limiting. Basically it's not going to spread through a population, and will eventually just die out. When R0 is 1, a disease will kind of hang
around, but it won't cause an outbreak Above 1, and things start to look bad because the number of infected people increases exponentially To put that in perspective, the most contagious diseases we know of have double or even triple digit R0s That’s why a disease like ebola—which
has an R0 between 1.5 and 2.5—can cause epidemics but isn’t considered super contagious. It is very infectious, though. Infectiousness is measured by the infective
dose— basically, how many virus particles, spores,
bacterial cells, or other sadistic little vehicles of doom
it actually takes to make you sick. Ebola is also really deadly. So basically, it’s extra-super terrifying. But if someone in your town has ebola,
you could probably hit up the local grocery store
without worrying— that’s not true for really contagious diseases
like measles. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease
that was basically eliminated from the United States
at the turn of this century, but now it’s clawing its way back.
Yay. Measles R0s from previous outbreaks vary a
lot, from about 5 to several hundred depending
on factors like population density and vaccination status. But taken together, it’s clear that if no
one is vaccinated, then an infected person with measles will likely infect more than
a dozen other people, each of whom can go on to infect another dozen or more people,
and so on. And it takes vaccination rates above 95% to
push that R0 to 1 or less to keep it in check. One of the main reasons measles is so contagious
is that, kind of like ebola, it’s really infectious—it doesn’t take a lot of viruses
to get you sick. If you are in close contact with someone who
has measles and you’re unvaccinated, your chances of getting sick are about 90 percent. Meanwhile, during flu season, you probably
breathe in influenza viruses any time you enter an enclosed, public space like an airplane
or a daycare without getting sick… most of the time. Another big reason it gets around is its route
of transmission. Measles can go airborne, where it can linger
for up to two hours. Theoretically, someone with measles can walk
into an elevator, cough, and then two hours later you can walk into the same elevator
and catch it. You don’t even have to be in the same room at the same time! And measles has a way to ensure a lot of little
infectious viruses get into the air with every cough. As they say in real estate, it’s all about
location, location, location. The measles virus makes itself at home in
your trachea, at the top of your respiratory system, so it’s in a prime position to come
out when you cough or sneeze. Other respiratory viruses, like influenza,
have to travel much further in order to get out of your body. And Ebola, by comparison, is spread through
bodily fluids. So you have to come into contact with things
like blood, vomit, or feces in order to become infected. Which is much less likely than the elevator
scenario, though infinitely more disgusting. Also, people with ebola aren’t contagious
until they develop symptoms. So they’re not really likely to wander around during
the contagious period when they can spread the infection. People with measles can be contagious up to
four days before the characteristic rash develops. So they might think they have a cold, shrug
it off, and spend days walk around coughing, sneezing, pushing elevator buttons, shaking
hands, or going to Disneyland, before it even occurs to them they should stay home. This sort of thing happens with other diseases,
too—like the bacterial illness pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Pertussis generally has an R0 of 12 to 17,
which probably has something to do with the fact that adolescents and adults often get
a mild, cold-like version of the disease, or have no symptoms at all. That’s simply not the case with influenza,
which has a low R0 of around 1 or 2. People with the flu are only contagious for about
a day before they develop symptoms. And they’re most contagious when they’re
three or four days in—when they’re most likely in bed. One of the only viruses to top measles’
claim to contagious fame is rotavirus, the nasty stomach bug that’s most common in
children. It has an average R0 of about 25. And that’s probably because, like measles,
it’s extremely infectious, but it’s even hardier. It causes explosive diarrhea and is most common
in children, so, well, you can extrapolate from there how it gets around. Also, the virus is present in an infected
person’s feces before they develop symptoms, and it can last hours on unwashed hands, days on some surfaces, and weeks in drinking water. In fact, small kids with questionable hygiene is a common theme when it comes to super-contagious diseases. That certainly helps measles move around schools and daycares, and it’s part of why chickenpox generally has an R0 of 10 to 12. The virus can be passed through the air, but it’s also present inside the pustules that develop, so it can get all over kids’ hands when they scratch those itchy lumps. The virus that causes chickenpox probably doesn’t survive too long outside the human body, though—which is why it doesn’t quite have the legs that measles does. So, in conclusion, you should stockpile beans, rice, and bottled water and never leave your house. Or, you could take reasonable precautions
against contagious diseases. The contagiousness of viruses like measles is a big part of why we’ve developed vaccines against them—because even if they’re not
as deadly as ebola, they are still deadly. The likelihood someone will die depends a
lot on where they live — in developed countries like the United States it’s around around
a half a percent, but in developing countries it’s closer to 6%. Unfortunately, some people, like young babies or people with compromised immune systems, aren’t able to get those vaccines. So if you want to help protect everyone around you and stay safe yourself, you can get vaccinated and get your children vaccinated on the recommended
schedule. And don’t forget to do the usual common
sense things like wash your hands frequently, and, for the most part, steer clear of other
people’s bodily fluids. I mean, you might luck out and stay healthy no matter what. But taking such simple steps can reduce your odds of getting sick. And
if you want to really understand what it means to reduce those odds, you might want to check out the Probability course on Brilliant.org.

**Transcript**:
American engineer Percy Spencer developed
World War II RADAR technology that helped detect Nazi airplanes— but it would soon have other
surprising applications. One day in 1945, Spencer was standing
near a RADAR instrument called a magnetron, a device that produced high-intensity
microwaves that could reflect off planes. Suddenly, he noticed that the
candy bar in his pocket had melted. He exposed other things to the magnetron
and, sure enough, popcorn kernels popped, and an egg—well— exploded
onto a colleague. Soon after, the first microwave oven
became available, operating using the very same technology. So, how does it work? All light energy travels in waves of
oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These oscillations span a range
of frequencies comprising the electromagnetic spectrum. The higher the frequency,
the more energetic. Gamma rays and X-rays
have the highest frequencies; microwaves and radio waves,
the lowest. Generally, light’s oscillating electric
field exerts forces on charged particles, like the electrons in a molecule. When light encounters polar molecules,
like water, it can make them rotate, as their positive and negative regions are
pushed and pulled in different directions. The frequency the light is traveling at also determines how it
interacts with matter. Microwaves interact strongly with the
water molecules found in most foods. Essentially, they make the molecules
jostle against each other, creating frictional heat. Household microwave ovens are
fitted with cavity magnetrons. When you activate
a microwave oven, a heated element within the magnetron
ejects electrons, and a strong magnet forces them
to spiral outwards. As they pass over the magnetron’s
metallic cavities, the electrons induce
an oscillating charge, generating a continuous stream
of electromagnetic microwaves. A metal pipe directs the microwaves
into the main food compartment, where they bounce off the metal walls and penetrate a few centimeters
into the food inside. When the microwaves encounter
polar molecules in the food, like water, they make them vibrate
at high frequencies. This can have interesting effects
depending on the food's composition. Oil and sugar absorb fewer
microwaves than water, so if you microwave them alone,
not much happens. But when microwaves encounter
a marshmallow, they heat the moisture trapped
within its gelatin-sugar matrix, making the hot air expand
and the marshmallow puff. Butter is essentially a suspension
of water droplets in fat. When microwaved,
the water rapidly vaporizes, making the butter melt quickly—
and sometimes, a bit violently. So microwaves heat food molecules
mechanically, through friction— but they don't alter them chemically. Soup heated in the microwave
is molecularly indistinguishable from soup heated using a stove or oven. The term “microwave radiation”
can be alarming. But in physics, radiation simply describes
any transfer of energy across a gap. High frequency, ionizing radiation
may be harmful because it can strip electrons
from molecules, including DNA. However, microwaves aren’t energetic
enough to alter chemical bonds. And microwave ovens are designed
to prevent leakage— for safety and efficiency’s sake. Nonetheless, to totally limit exposure, experts recommend simply standing a
few feet away when a microwave oven is on. Microwaving metal is dangerous, 
though, right? Well, it depends. Metals are conductors, meaning their electrons are loosely bound
to their atoms and move freely in response
to electric fields. Instead of absorbing microwave radiation, the metal’s electrons concentrate
on the surface, leading to high voltages at sharp edges,
corners, and small gaps. This includes areas between the creases
on a sheet of aluminum foil, the prongs of a fork, or a metal object
and the microwave oven’s metal walls. Sometimes, voltages get high enough
to strip electrons from the surrounding air molecules. This electrically charged gas, or plasma,
may then form lightning-like sparks and grow as it absorbs more microwaves. Once the oven is turned off,
the plasma dissipates. But not all metal objects
spark in the microwave— though they might make things
cook a little unevenly. In fact, a lot of microwavable packaging
takes advantage of this, using a thin metal coating
to crisp the food’s surface. And overall, as long as it doesn't
approach the oven's walls, leaving a metal spoon
in a microwaving bowl of soup should be a pretty uneventful affair. That’s just another neat benefit
of cooking with RADAR.

**Transcript**:
American engineer Percy Spencer developed
World War II RADAR technology that helped detect Nazi airplanes— but it would soon have other
surprising applications. One day in 1945, Spencer was standing
near a RADAR instrument called a magnetron, a device that produced high-intensity
microwaves that could reflect off planes. Suddenly, he noticed that the
candy bar in his pocket had melted. He exposed other things to the magnetron
and, sure enough, popcorn kernels popped, and an egg—well— exploded
onto a colleague. Soon after, the first microwave oven
became available, operating using the very same technology. So, how does it work? All light energy travels in waves of
oscillating electric and magnetic fields. These oscillations span a range
of frequencies comprising the electromagnetic spectrum. The higher the frequency,
the more energetic. Gamma rays and X-rays
have the highest frequencies; microwaves and radio waves,
the lowest. Generally, light’s oscillating electric
field exerts forces on charged particles, like the electrons in a molecule. When light encounters polar molecules,
like water, it can make them rotate, as their positive and negative regions are
pushed and pulled in different directions. The frequency the light is traveling at also determines how it
interacts with matter. Microwaves interact strongly with the
water molecules found in most foods. Essentially, they make the molecules
jostle against each other, creating frictional heat. Household microwave ovens are
fitted with cavity magnetrons. When you activate
a microwave oven, a heated element within the magnetron
ejects electrons, and a strong magnet forces them
to spiral outwards. As they pass over the magnetron’s
metallic cavities, the electrons induce
an oscillating charge, generating a continuous stream
of electromagnetic microwaves. A metal pipe directs the microwaves
into the main food compartment, where they bounce off the metal walls and penetrate a few centimeters
into the food inside. When the microwaves encounter
polar molecules in the food, like water, they make them vibrate
at high frequencies. This can have interesting effects
depending on the food's composition. Oil and sugar absorb fewer
microwaves than water, so if you microwave them alone,
not much happens. But when microwaves encounter
a marshmallow, they heat the moisture trapped
within its gelatin-sugar matrix, making the hot air expand
and the marshmallow puff. Butter is essentially a suspension
of water droplets in fat. When microwaved,
the water rapidly vaporizes, making the butter melt quickly—
and sometimes, a bit violently. So microwaves heat food molecules
mechanically, through friction— but they don't alter them chemically. Soup heated in the microwave
is molecularly indistinguishable from soup heated using a stove or oven. The term “microwave radiation”
can be alarming. But in physics, radiation simply describes
any transfer of energy across a gap. High frequency, ionizing radiation
may be harmful because it can strip electrons
from molecules, including DNA. However, microwaves aren’t energetic
enough to alter chemical bonds. And microwave ovens are designed
to prevent leakage— for safety and efficiency’s sake. Nonetheless, to totally limit exposure, experts recommend simply standing a
few feet away when a microwave oven is on. Microwaving metal is dangerous, 
though, right? Well, it depends. Metals are conductors, meaning their electrons are loosely bound
to their atoms and move freely in response
to electric fields. Instead of absorbing microwave radiation, the metal’s electrons concentrate
on the surface, leading to high voltages at sharp edges,
corners, and small gaps. This includes areas between the creases
on a sheet of aluminum foil, the prongs of a fork, or a metal object
and the microwave oven’s metal walls. Sometimes, voltages get high enough
to strip electrons from the surrounding air molecules. This electrically charged gas, or plasma,
may then form lightning-like sparks and grow as it absorbs more microwaves. Once the oven is turned off,
the plasma dissipates. But not all metal objects
spark in the microwave— though they might make things
cook a little unevenly. In fact, a lot of microwavable packaging
takes advantage of this, using a thin metal coating
to crisp the food’s surface. And overall, as long as it doesn't
approach the oven's walls, leaving a metal spoon
in a microwaving bowl of soup should be a pretty uneventful affair. That’s just another neat benefit
of cooking with RADAR.

**Transcript**:
With his appetite for conquest
and knack for combat, the shark god Dakuwaqa was determined
to vanquish all his rivals. Long ago, the ancestral gods of Fiji,
known as kalou vu or simply vu, settled on the Pacific archipelago, each establishing a village
in a different area. Eventually, they metamorphosed
into various forms. Dakuwaqa settled
on resource-rich Cakaudrove and transformed into a shark. But he was unsatisfied. He became proud and greedy,
and wanted to challenge every vu, establish himself as the mightiest,
and dominate all of Fiji’s islands. In his quest for power, Dakuwaqa sped
through the waters toward Rewa, where a quick and cunning eel-shaped vu
tried to stop him in the mouth of a river. Soon, the two were tumbling
through the water, locked in combat. The brawling vu created towering waves, stretching the river further inshore
and flooding nearby coastal communities. In the end, the eel was no match
for Dakuwaqa’s ferocity. After the fight, the Rewa River became
the longest and widest in Fiji, which made nearby communities
especially prone to flooding. But Dakuwaqa didn’t care
what damage he caused, so long as he remained undefeated. Dakuwaqa continued on his rampage,
later vanquishing Masilaca, the small, mischievous shark vu
that lived near Beqa Island. Despite their rocky start,
the two became friends. But one day, Masilaca— perhaps growing
tired of Dakuwaqa’s proud, selfish ways and the chaos he’d caused
across the archipelago— presented a challenge he knew
Dakuwaqa couldn’t resist. Masilaca spoke about a fierce vu
called Rokobakaniceva, who guarded the outer island of Kadavu, and teased that,
until Dakuwaqa defeated them, he couldn’t claim the title
of strongest vu. Before Masilaca could even finish 
describing Rokobakaniceva, Dakuwaqa was jetting through the water
in the direction of Kadavu. As he came close,
Dakuwaqa saw a giant octopus hovering at the entrance to a reef. The octopus vu, Rokobakaniceva,
cared greatly for the people of Kadavu and asked Dakuwaqa politely to stay away
and not intimidate the villagers. Dakuwaqa was only emboldened
by the request. He showed his imposing teeth
and lunged forward to attack. But Rokobakaniceva was prepared. With four tentacles, the octopus vu
remained rooted to a rock on the seafloor and with the remaining four,
captured Dakuwaqa’s body and flipped him over. In this position, his breathing slowed
and his muscles relaxed. He was paralyzed and powerless in a
mysterious state called tonic immobility that some sharks assume when flipped over or when the sensitive pores
of their snout are stimulated. Dakuwaqa was stuck upside down
and struggling to breathe, and Rokobakaniceva’s tentacles wrapped
tighter and tighter around his body. Though still shocked, Dakuwaqa realized the battle was lost
for the first time in his life. In exchange for Rokobakaniceva’s mercy,
he promised that he would change his ways. Instead of menacing the villagers
and other vu, he vowed to protect Fijian fishers
from Kadavu and beyond. Pleased with the pact,
Rokobakaniceva agreed and freed Dakuwaqa. He stayed true to his word—
no longer bragging about dueling vu, conquering coastlines,
and taking tributes. Instead, he began finding satisfaction
in guiding lost people back to their homes and warning local fishers of bad weather
and sinister sea creatures. In return, some of Fiji’s people would
pay homage to Dakuwaqa by pouring a traditional drink— yaqona,
also known as kava— into the ocean. And upon returning safely from fishing
trips with an abundance of catch, they’d throw fish heads back
into the ocean for the sharks— gestures of mutual care to elicit luck and protection from Dakuwaqa himself.

**Transcript**:
With his appetite for conquest
and knack for combat, the shark god Dakuwaqa was determined
to vanquish all his rivals. Long ago, the ancestral gods of Fiji,
known as kalou vu or simply vu, settled on the Pacific archipelago, each establishing a village
in a different area. Eventually, they metamorphosed
into various forms. Dakuwaqa settled
on resource-rich Cakaudrove and transformed into a shark. But he was unsatisfied. He became proud and greedy,
and wanted to challenge every vu, establish himself as the mightiest,
and dominate all of Fiji’s islands. In his quest for power, Dakuwaqa sped
through the waters toward Rewa, where a quick and cunning eel-shaped vu
tried to stop him in the mouth of a river. Soon, the two were tumbling
through the water, locked in combat. The brawling vu created towering waves, stretching the river further inshore
and flooding nearby coastal communities. In the end, the eel was no match
for Dakuwaqa’s ferocity. After the fight, the Rewa River became
the longest and widest in Fiji, which made nearby communities
especially prone to flooding. But Dakuwaqa didn’t care
what damage he caused, so long as he remained undefeated. Dakuwaqa continued on his rampage,
later vanquishing Masilaca, the small, mischievous shark vu
that lived near Beqa Island. Despite their rocky start,
the two became friends. But one day, Masilaca— perhaps growing
tired of Dakuwaqa’s proud, selfish ways and the chaos he’d caused
across the archipelago— presented a challenge he knew
Dakuwaqa couldn’t resist. Masilaca spoke about a fierce vu
called Rokobakaniceva, who guarded the outer island of Kadavu, and teased that,
until Dakuwaqa defeated them, he couldn’t claim the title
of strongest vu. Before Masilaca could even finish 
describing Rokobakaniceva, Dakuwaqa was jetting through the water
in the direction of Kadavu. As he came close,
Dakuwaqa saw a giant octopus hovering at the entrance to a reef. The octopus vu, Rokobakaniceva,
cared greatly for the people of Kadavu and asked Dakuwaqa politely to stay away
and not intimidate the villagers. Dakuwaqa was only emboldened
by the request. He showed his imposing teeth
and lunged forward to attack. But Rokobakaniceva was prepared. With four tentacles, the octopus vu
remained rooted to a rock on the seafloor and with the remaining four,
captured Dakuwaqa’s body and flipped him over. In this position, his breathing slowed
and his muscles relaxed. He was paralyzed and powerless in a
mysterious state called tonic immobility that some sharks assume when flipped over or when the sensitive pores
of their snout are stimulated. Dakuwaqa was stuck upside down
and struggling to breathe, and Rokobakaniceva’s tentacles wrapped
tighter and tighter around his body. Though still shocked, Dakuwaqa realized the battle was lost
for the first time in his life. In exchange for Rokobakaniceva’s mercy,
he promised that he would change his ways. Instead of menacing the villagers
and other vu, he vowed to protect Fijian fishers
from Kadavu and beyond. Pleased with the pact,
Rokobakaniceva agreed and freed Dakuwaqa. He stayed true to his word—
no longer bragging about dueling vu, conquering coastlines,
and taking tributes. Instead, he began finding satisfaction
in guiding lost people back to their homes and warning local fishers of bad weather
and sinister sea creatures. In return, some of Fiji’s people would
pay homage to Dakuwaqa by pouring a traditional drink— yaqona,
also known as kava— into the ocean. And upon returning safely from fishing
trips with an abundance of catch, they’d throw fish heads back
into the ocean for the sharks— gestures of mutual care to elicit luck and protection from Dakuwaqa himself.

**Transcript**:
In 1947, India achieved independence
from British rule— but this freedom came
at a tremendous cost. The region had been split in two,
displacing over 10 million residents and leading to riots that saw the deaths
of roughly 1 million people. Jawaharlal Nehru, 
India’s first prime minister, was eager to usher his country
towards a brighter, united future. And one of the projects that would prove
most essential to realizing this vision was the construction of Chandigarh: a modern metropolis designed to symbolize
“the nation’s faith in the future.” But the path to Nehru’s futurist city
was far from simple. Since money was tight
for the burgeoning nation, the project was only able to secure
a budget of 175 million rupees. That’s the modern equivalent
of roughly 500 million US dollars— which is barely enough to build
a pair of skyscrapers today. The project also had low public support because the plans required the
further displacement of local villages. The government compensated protesting
residents with funds to buy new homes. But their agricultural lands would
still be overtaken by the new city. Nehru’s plan for unity
was off to a rocky start. But the city’s plans were as inspiring
as they were innovative. In 1949, Nehru commissioned
American architect Albert Mayer, whose initial designs laid out
green spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems. When Mayer left the project
due to his business partner’s death, his plans were taken even further
by renowned French architect Le Corbusier. Known as one of the fathers
of modern architecture, Le Corbusier prioritized functional
designs devoid of ornamentation. His style championed unornamented concrete
for creating efficient structures that prioritized function over decoration. Building on Mayer’s plans, Le Corbusier introduced the metaphor
of a human body to describe and design
Chandigarh’s urban environment. The head of the city would comprise
the main administrative area. Alongside the State Secretariat,
Parliamentary Assembly and High Court, the complex included symbolic structures
like the Martyr’s Memorial, dedicated to those who perished fighting
for Indian independence. From the head, residents could travel
down the city’s circulatory system: a network of roads and pathways
known as the 7Vs. These hierarchical roads connected
Chandigarh to other cities while seamlessly linking
the sectors within for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Chandigarh’s heart was Sector 17—
a commercial district housing large shops, offices, a parade ground,
and the main interstate bus terminal. And the city’s lungs took the form
of a continuous Leisure Valley. This series of green belts was modeled
after the popular garden city concept, which sought to increase green cover and guarantee all residents access
to fresh air and open space. Taken as a whole, these plans were
unprecedented, daring, and expensive. Fortunately, Le Corbusier’s streamlined
modernist aesthetic helped keep costs low. Most structures were built of brick,
which was left unpainted and unplastered. Even the city’s grandest concrete
buildings remain naked to this day. And since the budget couldn’t accommodate
mechanical heating and cooling systems, Chandigarh was designed
with passive cooling and ventilation built into every structure. Other tropical cities employed
similar techniques on a smaller scale, but in Chandigarh every room
had direct access to adequate sunlight and ventilation. Overhangs provided shade during the summer
and let in heat during the winter. And today, the energy efficiency
of Chandigarh’s many brick buildings has made the city famous
for its eco-friendly design. Of course, neither Chandigarh’s
past nor present is perfect. The hierarchy of housing types
resulted in segregation between affluent, large households
and small, denser plots. And the city’s focus on residential
and government buildings prevented the development
of other industries. But many other elements of Mayer and
Le Corbusier’s plans have aged quite well. Thousands of trees and open spaces
make it one of India’s greenest cities. And its high quality of life continues

**Transcript**:
In 1947, India achieved independence
from British rule— but this freedom came
at a tremendous cost. The region had been split in two,
displacing over 10 million residents and leading to riots that saw the deaths
of roughly 1 million people. Jawaharlal Nehru, 
India’s first prime minister, was eager to usher his country
towards a brighter, united future. And one of the projects that would prove
most essential to realizing this vision was the construction of Chandigarh: a modern metropolis designed to symbolize
“the nation’s faith in the future.” But the path to Nehru’s futurist city
was far from simple. Since money was tight
for the burgeoning nation, the project was only able to secure
a budget of 175 million rupees. That’s the modern equivalent
of roughly 500 million US dollars— which is barely enough to build
a pair of skyscrapers today. The project also had low public support because the plans required the
further displacement of local villages. The government compensated protesting
residents with funds to buy new homes. But their agricultural lands would
still be overtaken by the new city. Nehru’s plan for unity
was off to a rocky start. But the city’s plans were as inspiring
as they were innovative. In 1949, Nehru commissioned
American architect Albert Mayer, whose initial designs laid out
green spaces, sectioned neighborhoods, and organized traffic systems. When Mayer left the project
due to his business partner’s death, his plans were taken even further
by renowned French architect Le Corbusier. Known as one of the fathers
of modern architecture, Le Corbusier prioritized functional
designs devoid of ornamentation. His style championed unornamented concrete
for creating efficient structures that prioritized function over decoration. Building on Mayer’s plans, Le Corbusier introduced the metaphor
of a human body to describe and design
Chandigarh’s urban environment. The head of the city would comprise
the main administrative area. Alongside the State Secretariat,
Parliamentary Assembly and High Court, the complex included symbolic structures
like the Martyr’s Memorial, dedicated to those who perished fighting
for Indian independence. From the head, residents could travel
down the city’s circulatory system: a network of roads and pathways
known as the 7Vs. These hierarchical roads connected
Chandigarh to other cities while seamlessly linking
the sectors within for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. Chandigarh’s heart was Sector 17—

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Deep inside the Sumatran rainforest,
a carrion fly descends, guided by the scent
of its favorite place to lay eggs: dead and rotting animal carcasses. But when it lands,
it isn’t on liquefying flesh, but instead on the world’s biggest,
and perhaps strangest, flower— Rafflesia arnoldii. Rafflesia is a genus of over 30 species found across the tropical forests
of Southeast Asia. While its smallest representative has
a flower only a few centimeters wide, its biggest weighs seven kilograms
and spans over a meter wide. And its putrid aroma isn’t the only thing
that sets these plants apart— all Rafflesia are parasites. For most of its life, the Rafflesia plant
exists as an endophyte, a single thin strand of almost uniform
cells beneath the bark of its host. It strictly infects Tetrastigma, a genus of large vines
related to the grape. Like typical leafy plants, the host
Tetrastigma’s cells contain chloroplasts. These organelles convert
sunlight into energy and are each equipped with their own DNA. Rafflesia’s plastids, on the other hand,
appear to have lost their DNA, and with it the ability
to photosynthesize. This sort of loss is incredibly rare. With no roots and no ability
to produce its own food, Rafflesia is completely dependent
on its host, siphoning the Tetrastigma’s water
and nutrients to fuel its own growth. And Rafflesia’s propensity for theft
doesn’t end there. Using a process known
as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT, Rafflesia has stolen quite a bit
of genetic material from its host and other plants in its habitat. While HGT is well known in bacteria, it has only recently been documented
in parasitic plants. And scientists are still
trying to understand exactly how this DNA transfer happens. Rafflesia appears to utilize several
of these stolen sequences as if they were their own, transcribing the DNA into RNA
and then translating it into proteins, which are used in key cellular processes. After living some time embedded
in the host vine, Rafflesia emerges as a single bud, which then takes several months,
or even a year, to reach full size. When it opens, its fleshy maroon petals emit several foul-smelling
sulfur-containing compounds. The evolutionary reason for this odor
is relatively straightforward: to attract pollinators. For most species of Rafflesia,
single flowers are either male or female. So, to produce a seed, pollen must be transferred
from one flower to the next. The rotten stench is ideal for attracting
corpse-loving carrion flies, and the massive size of the flower
may help broadcast it through the stagnant rainforest air. A deceived fly will explore
the flower’s interior, laying thousands of ill-fated eggs. But during the fly’s visit, the male Rafflesia’s liquid pollen may
end up on the fly’s back where it dries. If the fly encounters
an open female Rafflesia flower, the pollen will rehydrate when rubbed
against the flower’s damp stigma, completing cross-pollination. A pollinated Rafflesia flower
gradually withers and turns black, but this doesn't mean it's dead. Over several months, a fruit forms
which contains thousands of tiny seeds. But what disperses these seeds
is still debated, with hypotheses ranging
from elephants to rodents to ants. We do know that the seeds have
an oily appendage called an elaiosome, a structure ants often
feed to their larvae. And scientists have even observed
ants carrying Rafflesia seeds. But what happens to the Rafflesia seeds
once inside the ant nest remains unclear. In any case, nobody has seen
Rafflesia seeds germinate, or attach to and infect a host root. Because this crucial step of their
development is still not fully understood, cultivation of Rafflesia is difficult. Despite many attempts,
botanists from around the globe have been largely unsuccessful
at growing Rafflesia from seeds outside its natural habitat. As these tropical forests
are under threat, we’re at risk of losing Rafflesia, and our ability to unravel
some of its many remaining secrets.

**Transcript**:
Deep inside the Sumatran rainforest,
a carrion fly descends, guided by the scent
of its favorite place to lay eggs: dead and rotting animal carcasses. But when it lands,
it isn’t on liquefying flesh, but instead on the world’s biggest,
and perhaps strangest, flower— Rafflesia arnoldii. Rafflesia is a genus of over 30 species found across the tropical forests
of Southeast Asia. While its smallest representative has
a flower only a few centimeters wide, its biggest weighs seven kilograms
and spans over a meter wide. And its putrid aroma isn’t the only thing
that sets these plants apart— all Rafflesia are parasites. For most of its life, the Rafflesia plant
exists as an endophyte, a single thin strand of almost uniform
cells beneath the bark of its host. It strictly infects Tetrastigma, a genus of large vines
related to the grape. Like typical leafy plants, the host
Tetrastigma’s cells contain chloroplasts. These organelles convert
sunlight into energy and are each equipped with their own DNA. Rafflesia’s plastids, on the other hand,
appear to have lost their DNA, and with it the ability
to photosynthesize. This sort of loss is incredibly rare. With no roots and no ability
to produce its own food, Rafflesia is completely dependent
on its host, siphoning the Tetrastigma’s water
and nutrients to fuel its own growth. And Rafflesia’s propensity for theft
doesn’t end there. Using a process known
as horizontal gene transfer, or HGT, Rafflesia has stolen quite a bit
of genetic material from its host and other plants in its habitat. While HGT is well known in bacteria, it has only recently been documented
in parasitic plants. And scientists are still
trying to understand exactly how this DNA transfer happens. Rafflesia appears to utilize several
of these stolen sequences as if they were their own, transcribing the DNA into RNA
and then translating it into proteins, which are used in key cellular processes. After living some time embedded
in the host vine, Rafflesia emerges as a single bud, which then takes several months,
or even a year, to reach full size. When it opens, its fleshy maroon petals emit several foul-smelling
sulfur-containing compounds. The evolutionary reason for this odor
is relatively straightforward: to attract pollinators. For most species of Rafflesia,
single flowers are either male or female. So, to produce a seed, pollen must be transferred
from one flower to the next. The rotten stench is ideal for attracting
corpse-loving carrion flies, and the massive size of the flower
may help broadcast it through the stagnant rainforest air. A deceived fly will explore
the flower’s interior, laying thousands of ill-fated eggs. But during the fly’s visit, the male Rafflesia’s liquid pollen may
end up on the fly’s back where it dries. If the fly encounters
an open female Rafflesia flower, the pollen will rehydrate when rubbed
against the flower’s damp stigma, completing cross-pollination. A pollinated Rafflesia flower
gradually withers and turns black, but this doesn't mean it's dead. Over several months, a fruit forms
which contains thousands of tiny seeds. But what disperses these seeds
is still debated, with hypotheses ranging
from elephants to rodents to ants. We do know that the seeds have
an oily appendage called an elaiosome, a structure ants often
feed to their larvae. And scientists have even observed
ants carrying Rafflesia seeds. But what happens to the Rafflesia seeds
once inside the ant nest remains unclear. In any case, nobody has seen
Rafflesia seeds germinate, or attach to and infect a host root. Because this crucial step of their
development is still not fully understood, cultivation of Rafflesia is difficult. Despite many attempts,
botanists from around the globe have been largely unsuccessful
at growing Rafflesia from seeds outside its natural habitat. As these tropical forests
are under threat, we’re at risk of losing Rafflesia, and our ability to unravel
some of its many remaining secrets.

**Transcript**:
In 1969, Dr. Donald Goodwin gathered
a group of study participants and asked them each to recall the object
he'd shown them two minutes prior. The twist? All the participants
were very intoxicated. Despite this, most could pay attention
to the task and correctly name the toy
they had just seen. Yet, when Donald asked them to recall
that object a mere 30 minutes later, half the participants drew a blank, having “blacked out” the earlier
moment entirely. This study illustrates the strange
and somewhat selective effects alcohol has on the brain. Many intoxicated people can perform
complex tasks like holding a detailed conversation
or navigating a walk home. Yet for those experiencing what
is known as a blackout, the memory of these events
is quickly forgotten. So how does alcohol cause
these memory lapses? First, let's identify the culprit. While a single drink often contains
hundreds of different chemical compounds, ethanol is responsible for alcohol's
effects on the brain. Ethanol is lightweight and lipophilic, meaning its structure easily dissolves
into fats, like those in the membranes
of the outer blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain,
ethanol’s unique structure allows it to bind to, interact, and affect
many different neuronal receptors, impairing pathways that allow you to make
careful decisions, control your impulses, and even manage your motor skills. And the networks that control memory
seem to be especially sensitive to alcohol’s effects. Typically, information about your
surroundings is taken in by your sensory organs
and sent to the brain. Neurons transfer this information
to one another via chemical messengers
called neurotransmitters, which are released by one neuron
and received by receptors at another. When a neurotransmitter
binds to a receptor, it unlocks an internal channel,
allowing small ions to flow into the cell. If enough ions enter the cell,
the neuron fires, sending the signal forward. Through this process,
different regions of the brain can communicate with one another
in milliseconds, creating our moment-to-moment
understanding of the world. But ethanol interacts with receptors, making it harder for neurons
to communicate. While compromised, the brain is
still able to transfer information, which is why many intoxicated people
seem somewhat capable of performing basic tasks. In other words, brain function
is highly impaired, but not completely broken. But memory storage is a different story. The transfer of
moment-to-moment understanding to something we can remember
is thought to depend on a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP. LTP happens throughout the brain, but is especially important
in learning and memory regions, like the neocortex and the hippocampus. During LTP, the firing of a neuron triggers
physical changes to its structure. For example, more receptors may be
moved to the cell's surface, making the neuron more sensitive
to future signaling from its neighbors. These physical changes increase
the likelihood that a cell will fire again at that connection, strengthening the wiring between neurons. And through this stronger connection, it's thought that a stable
memory is formed. Yet studies suggest that ethanol has
a unique ability to disrupt LTP, blocking the physical changes
needed for memory formation. So, while moment-to-moment information
is encoded and understood, the storage of that information
is blunted, resulting in a blackout. Of course, not all levels of drinking
result in blackouts. They happen when the concentration
of alcohol in the blood, or BAC, exceeds a certain level,
approximately 0.16. But there’s no magic number. At slightly lower BACs, brownouts,
or the spotty memory of events, can occur, as some neurons continue to function
properly while others fail. And drinking too much can cause
a person to pass out altogether. Other factors like dehydration level,
genetic differences, medications, and even how much you’ve eaten
can affect the likelihood of a blackout. And teenagers appear to be
especially vulnerable due to the substantial changes
in brain development during those years. Alcohol’s short-term effects
usually don’t last longer than the time it takes for their body
to metabolize it, or about a day. But repeatedly over-drinking can damage
neurons and permanently impair memory. It can also harm other organs
like the liver, which works overtime
breaking down alcohol. After all, experiencing a blackout
or witnessing others in this compromised state can be a lot for your mind
and body to process.

is thought to depend on a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP. LTP happens throughout the brain, but is especially important
in learning and memory regions, like the neocortex and the hippocampus. During LTP, the firing of a neuron triggers
physical changes to its structure. For example, more receptors may be
moved to the cell's surface, making the neuron more sensitive
to future signaling from its neighbors. These physical changes increase
the likelihood that a cell will fire again at that connection, strengthening the wiring between neurons. And through this stronger connection, it's thought that a stable
memory is formed. Yet studies suggest that ethanol has
a unique ability to disrupt LTP, blocking the physical changes
needed for memory formation. So, while moment-to-moment information
is encoded and understood, the storage of that information
is blunted, resulting in a blackout. Of course, not all levels of drinking
result in blackouts. They happen when the concentration
of alcohol in the blood, or BAC, exceeds a certain level,
approximately 0.16. But there’s no magic number. At slightly lower BACs, brownouts,
or the spotty memory of events, can occur, as some neurons continue to function
properly while others fail. And drinking too much can cause
a person to pass out altogether. Other factors like dehydration level,
genetic differences, medications, and even how much you’ve eaten
can affect the likelihood of a blackout. And teenagers appear to be
especially vulnerable due to the substantial changes
in brain development during those years. Alcohol’s short-term effects
usually don’t last longer than the time it takes for their body
to metabolize it, or about a day. But repeatedly over-drinking can damage
neurons and permanently impair memory. It can also harm other organs
like the liver, which works overtime
breaking down alcohol. After all, experiencing a blackout
or witnessing others in this compromised state can be a lot for your mind
and body to process.

**Transcript**:
In 1969, Dr. Donald Goodwin gathered
a group of study participants and asked them each to recall the object
he'd shown them two minutes prior. The twist? All the participants
were very intoxicated. Despite this, most could pay attention
to the task and correctly name the toy
they had just seen. Yet, when Donald asked them to recall
that object a mere 30 minutes later, half the participants drew a blank, having “blacked out” the earlier
moment entirely. This study illustrates the strange
and somewhat selective effects alcohol has on the brain. Many intoxicated people can perform
complex tasks like holding a detailed conversation
or navigating a walk home. Yet for those experiencing what
is known as a blackout, the memory of these events
is quickly forgotten. So how does alcohol cause
these memory lapses? First, let's identify the culprit. While a single drink often contains
hundreds of different chemical compounds, ethanol is responsible for alcohol's
effects on the brain. Ethanol is lightweight and lipophilic, meaning its structure easily dissolves
into fats, like those in the membranes
of the outer blood-brain barrier. Once inside the brain,
ethanol’s unique structure allows it to bind to, interact, and affect
many different neuronal receptors, impairing pathways that allow you to make
careful decisions, control your impulses, and even manage your motor skills. And the networks that control memory
seem to be especially sensitive to alcohol’s effects. Typically, information about your
surroundings is taken in by your sensory organs
and sent to the brain. Neurons transfer this information
to one another via chemical messengers
called neurotransmitters, which are released by one neuron
and received by receptors at another. When a neurotransmitter
binds to a receptor, it unlocks an internal channel,
allowing small ions to flow into the cell. If enough ions enter the cell,
the neuron fires, sending the signal forward. Through this process,
different regions of the brain can communicate with one another
in milliseconds, creating our moment-to-moment
understanding of the world. But ethanol interacts with receptors, making it harder for neurons
to communicate. While compromised, the brain is
still able to transfer information, which is why many intoxicated people
seem somewhat capable of performing basic tasks. In other words, brain function
is highly impaired, but not completely broken. But memory storage is a different story. The transfer of
moment-to-moment understanding to something we can remember
is thought to depend on a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP. LTP happens throughout the brain, but is especially important
in learning and memory regions, like the neocortex and the hippocampus. During LTP, the firing of a neuron triggers
physical changes to its structure. For example, more receptors may be
moved to the cell's surface, making the neuron more sensitive
to future signaling from its neighbors. These physical changes increase
the likelihood that a cell will fire again at that connection, strengthening the wiring between neurons. And through this stronger connection, it's thought that a stable
memory is formed. Yet studies suggest that ethanol has

**Transcript**:
Dodos are commonly considered
brainless, blundering birds that were poorly adapted
and doomed to die off, making their human-mediated extinction
effortless and inevitable. But that's not the case. So, what were dodos actually like?
And what really caused their downfall? Let's start at their origin. Okay, rewinding more than
20 million years, some tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia
voyaged across the Indian Ocean, perhaps by gradually journeying
from island to island. Eventually, their descendants came to a
remote archipelago east of Madagascar. Those that settled likely
diversified over time. Then, about 8 million years ago, an underwater volcano formed another
island on the chain, which would come to be known as Mauritius. Some of the birds populated
this new island, too, and down the line,
dodos emerged as a distinct species. They shared Mauritius with bats, lizards,
giant tortoises, and other birds. The closest large predators were held
back by about 800 kilometers of ocean, so getting murdered was basically
a non-issue. Without the need for defensive
adaptations, like flight, expending energy on them
would have been wasteful. So, as with the kākāpōs of New Zealand
and the cormorants of the Galápagos, their flight muscles shrank. Dodos probably nested
on the island's forest floor, feasting on fruits and seeds. Reaching just under a meter tall, they were among the island's
largest animals. And they were well-adapted
to their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry
and wet conditions. They also survived some major disruptions. Around 4,300 years ago, a megadrought caused waves
of mass mortality events on Mauritius. Fresh water grew scarce
and lakes likely grew saltier and became treacherous traps. This lasted for around 150 years. However, dodos prevailed...
until a few millennia later, when everything changed— quickly. In 1598, Dutch sailors came
ashore on Mauritius, and the island soon became
a welcome stopover for their trade ships. The sailors described natural wonders, including large numbers of birds
twice as big as swans and tortoises with shells huge enough
to fit 10 men. Mauritian animals hadn't evolved
to fear being hunted by humans, so they were an easy catch. Sailors ate some dodos,
but this alone didn't cause their doom. The Dutch sailors came with company. They brought macaques
that were probably pets. They released goats and pigs
on the island to establish food sources. And at some point, sailors also
inadvertently introduced rats. It's thought that goats and pigs grazed
and rooted through the forest understory, which dodos lived in; pigs, macaques, and rats preyed
on dodo eggs and chicks; and all of them competed with dodos
for resources. Dodos were last seen less than a century
after Dutch arrival. At the time, people didn't recognize
that species could disappear. It wasn't until a century later,
in the 1790s, that a scientist conclusively demonstrated
the concept of extinction. By then, many thought dodos were fake. But discoveries from digs and sparse
remains helped confirm their existence. Nevertheless, representations of dodos
were misleading. One popular natural history text
of the late 1700s characterized them as stupid,
voracious, and grotesque. Once Lewis Carroll included a dodo in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
in 1865, the birds quickly amassed popularity. But dodos continued being framed as inept,
clumsy, lazy, and unfit for survival in scholarly works, satirical magazines,
and children's poems alike. And yet, there's no evidence that dodos
were less intelligent than their relatives. The dodo's brain size relative to its body
was similar to that of other pigeons. And especially rotund dodo depictions
are misleading. They may have been inspired by what dodos
looked like during mating displays or in captivity— or they were just
poor artistic renderings. Scientists think dodos were
fairly muscular birds. All in all, the dodo was, in fact,
a survivor that withstood major natural disasters
and thrived on its island home. It simply wasn't prepared for a sudden
onslaught of invasive species. And neither were other
endemic Mauritian animals, including raven parrots, fruit bats,
and giant tortoises. In the aftermath, perhaps it was easier
to declare the dodo's extinction the result of its personal failing
than to admit it was a human one.

**Transcript**:
Dodos are commonly considered
brainless, blundering birds that were poorly adapted
and doomed to die off, making their human-mediated extinction
effortless and inevitable. But that's not the case. So, what were dodos actually like?
And what really caused their downfall? Let's start at their origin. Okay, rewinding more than
20 million years, some tropical pigeons from Southeast Asia
voyaged across the Indian Ocean, perhaps by gradually journeying
from island to island. Eventually, their descendants came to a
remote archipelago east of Madagascar. Those that settled likely
diversified over time. Then, about 8 million years ago, an underwater volcano formed another
island on the chain, which would come to be known as Mauritius. Some of the birds populated
this new island, too, and down the line,
dodos emerged as a distinct species. They shared Mauritius with bats, lizards,
giant tortoises, and other birds. The closest large predators were held
back by about 800 kilometers of ocean, so getting murdered was basically
a non-issue. Without the need for defensive
adaptations, like flight, expending energy on them
would have been wasteful. So, as with the kākāpōs of New Zealand
and the cormorants of the Galápagos, their flight muscles shrank. Dodos probably nested
on the island's forest floor, feasting on fruits and seeds. Reaching just under a meter tall, they were among the island's
largest animals. And they were well-adapted
to their environment, which could fluctuate between extreme dry
and wet conditions. They also survived some major disruptions. Around 4,300 years ago, a megadrought caused waves
of mass mortality events on Mauritius. Fresh water grew scarce
and lakes likely grew saltier and became treacherous traps. This lasted for around 150 years. However, dodos prevailed...
until a few millennia later, when everything changed— quickly. In 1598, Dutch sailors came
ashore on Mauritius, and the island soon became
a welcome stopover for their trade ships. The sailors described natural wonders, including large numbers of birds
twice as big as swans and tortoises with shells huge enough
to fit 10 men. Mauritian animals hadn't evolved
to fear being hunted by humans, so they were an easy catch. Sailors ate some dodos,
but this alone didn't cause their doom. The Dutch sailors came with company. They brought macaques
that were probably pets. They released goats and pigs
on the island to establish food sources. And at some point, sailors also
inadvertently introduced rats. It's thought that goats and pigs grazed
and rooted through the forest understory, which dodos lived in; pigs, macaques, and rats preyed
on dodo eggs and chicks; and all of them competed with dodos
for resources. Dodos were last seen less than a century
after Dutch arrival. At the time, people didn't recognize
that species could disappear. It wasn't until a century later,
in the 1790s, that a scientist conclusively demonstrated
the concept of extinction. By then, many thought dodos were fake. But discoveries from digs and sparse
remains helped confirm their existence. Nevertheless, representations of dodos
were misleading. One popular natural history text
of the late 1700s characterized them as stupid,
voracious, and grotesque. Once Lewis Carroll included a dodo in "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"
in 1865, the birds quickly amassed popularity. But dodos continued being framed as inept,
clumsy, lazy, and unfit for survival in scholarly works, satirical magazines,
and children's poems alike. And yet, there's no evidence that dodos
were less intelligent than their relatives. The dodo's brain size relative to its body
was similar to that of other pigeons. And especially rotund dodo depictions
are misleading. They may have been inspired by what dodos
looked like during mating displays or in captivity— or they were just
poor artistic renderings. Scientists think dodos were
fairly muscular birds. All in all, the dodo was, in fact,
a survivor that withstood major natural disasters
and thrived on its island home. It simply wasn't prepared for a sudden
onslaught of invasive species. And neither were other

**Transcript**:
You might not guess it,
but this Alcon blue butterfly is a parasite whose offspring
will live highly unusual lives. She lays pinhead-sized eggs
on a wildflower and is off. The first tiny caterpillar
hatches a few days later. After two weeks living
within a flower bud, he embarks on a high-risk operation
that will require infiltrating a densely guarded fortress undercover. He secretes a thread of silk
and descends to the ground. Here, he's more vulnerable than ever,
but he holds still and waits. His descent perfectly coincides
with the peak foraging hours of the nearby red ant colony. Soon enough, a worker ant
encounters the caterpillar. She inspects his cuticle
with her sensitive antennae and picks up on key chemical cues
that she uses to recognize her kin. This is all part of the
caterpillar's disguise. The worker picks him up
and reverses course. Indeed, the caterpillar doesn't battle
his way into the fortress. No— he wouldn't stand a chance. He's shepherded in because the ant is treating him like one
of her colony's own larvae. They pass legions of ants
poised to attack invaders and enter the intricately architected,
subterranean nest, which is sheltered, moist,
and stockpiled with resources. If the caterpillar's mimicry didn't work, he might have been left for dead
or taken as food himself. Instead, the ant places the caterpillar
in the nursery, among the colony's own cherished brood. Here, he produces sugary secretions
that the worker ants feed from. The nurse ants dote upon him, regurgitating food
into his mouth frequently. But he has a voracious appetite. He arches his body in a begging
posture to obtain more food, and, every now and then,
eats one of his own nestmates. The caterpillar also does things
that the ant larvae can't: he makes noises that sound a lot
like those emitted by the ant queens. In effect, he signals that he's royalty
and should be prioritized over the actual ant larvae. And that's exactly what happens. The nurse ants feed him extra. And when a wild boar causes part
of the nest to collapse, the ants rescue the caterpillar first. While members of the ant colony suffer
reduced survival rates because of the burdensome caterpillar, he passes the harsh winter
living like royalty. Come June, he's stored up plenty
of nutrients to make a dramatic transformation. He forms his chrysalis,
and for three weeks, he uses a tooth-and-comb organ to create
more queen-like acoustic vibrations, attracting workers to clean him. Then, at dawn one day,
he emerges an adult butterfly. Wings still wet, his body easily fits
through the gallery opening, and finally,
11 months after being taken in, he basks in the sun
and begins searching for a mate. When he dies about a week later, he'll have spent the vast majority
of his life in the realm of the ants. The Alcon blue is one of as many
as 200 parasitic butterfly species, all of which target ants. Sometimes, multiple caterpillars inhabit
the same ant colony at once. Some stay for almost two years. But researchers are still parsing
these complex relationships. For instance, certain ants guard Japanese
oakblue caterpillars from predators and consume the sugary secretions
the caterpillars produce in return. But it turns out that this
sweet concoction isn't a simple form of mutual assistance. Instead, chemicals in the secretions
actually manipulate the ants' behavior, inhibiting their movement and making them more protective
and aggressive caterpillar guards. Despite these masterful manipulations, parasitic butterflies are
vulnerable themselves. They're also the targets of parasitism. Even within their adopted,
high-security hideaways, parasitoid wasps sometimes track
the caterpillars down and lay eggs on their bodies. When the wasp larvae hatch,
they consume the caterpillars alive. And because their life cycles consist
of such a complex choreography involving specific plants and ants, small environmental changes can
affect their populations. One parasitic butterfly species actually
went extinct in the UK in 1979, before being reintroduced
a few years later. They've since rebounded alongside
efforts to restore the meadow habitats their host ants require to thrive— helping preserve these
riveting relationships and the astonishing adaptations
they inspire.

**Transcript**:
You might not guess it,
but this Alcon blue butterfly is a parasite whose offspring
will live highly unusual lives. She lays pinhead-sized eggs
on a wildflower and is off. The first tiny caterpillar
hatches a few days later. After two weeks living
within a flower bud, he embarks on a high-risk operation
that will require infiltrating a densely guarded fortress undercover. He secretes a thread of silk
and descends to the ground. Here, he's more vulnerable than ever,
but he holds still and waits. His descent perfectly coincides
with the peak foraging hours of the nearby red ant colony. Soon enough, a worker ant
encounters the caterpillar. She inspects his cuticle
with her sensitive antennae and picks up on key chemical cues
that she uses to recognize her kin. This is all part of the
caterpillar's disguise. The worker picks him up
and reverses course. Indeed, the caterpillar doesn't battle
his way into the fortress. No— he wouldn't stand a chance. He's shepherded in because the ant is treating him like one
of her colony's own larvae. They pass legions of ants
poised to attack invaders and enter the intricately architected,
subterranean nest, which is sheltered, moist,
and stockpiled with resources. If the caterpillar's mimicry didn't work, he might have been left for dead
or taken as food himself. Instead, the ant places the caterpillar
in the nursery, among the colony's own cherished brood. Here, he produces sugary secretions
that the worker ants feed from. The nurse ants dote upon him, regurgitating food
into his mouth frequently. But he has a voracious appetite. He arches his body in a begging
posture to obtain more food, and, every now and then,
eats one of his own nestmates. The caterpillar also does things
that the ant larvae can't: he makes noises that sound a lot
like those emitted by the ant queens. In effect, he signals that he's royalty
and should be prioritized over the actual ant larvae. And that's exactly what happens. The nurse ants feed him extra. And when a wild boar causes part
of the nest to collapse, the ants rescue the caterpillar first. While members of the ant colony suffer
reduced survival rates because of the burdensome caterpillar, he passes the harsh winter
living like royalty. Come June, he's stored up plenty
of nutrients to make a dramatic transformation. He forms his chrysalis,
and for three weeks, he uses a tooth-and-comb organ to create
more queen-like acoustic vibrations, attracting workers to clean him. Then, at dawn one day,
he emerges an adult butterfly. Wings still wet, his body easily fits
through the gallery opening, and finally,
11 months after being taken in, he basks in the sun
and begins searching for a mate. When he dies about a week later, he'll have spent the vast majority
of his life in the realm of the ants. The Alcon blue is one of as many
as 200 parasitic butterfly species, all of which target ants. Sometimes, multiple caterpillars inhabit
the same ant colony at once. Some stay for almost two years. But researchers are still parsing
these complex relationships. For instance, certain ants guard Japanese
oakblue caterpillars from predators and consume the sugary secretions
the caterpillars produce in return. But it turns out that this
sweet concoction isn't a simple form of mutual assistance. Instead, chemicals in the secretions
actually manipulate the ants' behavior, inhibiting their movement and making them more protective
and aggressive caterpillar guards. Despite these masterful manipulations, parasitic butterflies are
vulnerable themselves. They're also the targets of parasitism. Even within their adopted,
high-security hideaways, parasitoid wasps sometimes track
the caterpillars down and lay eggs on their bodies. When the wasp larvae hatch,
they consume the caterpillars alive. And because their life cycles consist
of such a complex choreography involving specific plants and ants, small environmental changes can
affect their populations. One parasitic butterfly species actually
went extinct in the UK in 1979, before being reintroduced
a few years later. They've since rebounded alongside
efforts to restore the meadow habitats their host ants require to thrive— helping preserve these
riveting relationships and the astonishing adaptations
they inspire.

**Transcript**:
In the kitchen at a friend's party, you're in the midst of a profound
moral conundrum. Famous philosophers whisper
advice in your ear. Utilitarian John Stuart Mill tells you
that one should always strive to bring about the greatest happiness
for the greatest number of people. Aristotle reminds you of the importance
of the virtues of generosity and justice. But Thomas Hobbes points out that "of all voluntary acts,
the object is to every man his own good." In other words, human beings
are inherently selfish anyway. So why shouldn't you take
the last cupcake for yourself? This is actually one of philosophy's
oldest questions. Not your cupcake dilemma— the question of whether or not
human beings are inherently selfish. The idea that humans only act
out of self-interest is known as psychological egoism, and there aren't many philosophers
who endorse this extreme stance. There's simply too much evidence
of humans sacrificing their self-interest, and sometimes their very lives,
for the sake of others. And studies by psychologists have shown
that even very young children demonstrate helpful behavior despite
there being nothing in it for themselves. However, the idea that all humans
have a deep selfish streak is something many more philosophers
would agree with. German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted
that while we often seem to act for the sake of others, it's impossible to be sure
we're not truly motivated by "a secret impulse of self-love." For example, maybe when people make
large donations to charity, they're actually more interested
in looking good or benefiting from tax breaks
than helping others. It's worth noting that not all 
philosophers think self-love is always a bad thing. French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
identified two kinds of self-love. He believed "Amour de soi,"
our basic need for self-preservation, is natural and essential. But he identified "amour propre," our toxic desire for recognition
and social status, as the cause of many unjust disparities. In a similar vein, Aristotle argued
that humans are social beings who can only flourish when we seek
the good of others as well as ourselves. By this logic, true self-love requires us
to work against our selfish tendencies. For many philosophers,
this is where the real problem lies— how do we overcome our selfishness? Some, like Kant, have argued
that our sense of moral duty is what helps us rise
above our narrow self-interest. Others, like Rousseau and Adam Smith, contend that emotions
like pity and sympathy are what allow us to consider
the needs of others. But 20th century philosopher-novelist
Iris Murdoch believed the only true solution
to human selfishness was love. Or at least,
a certain kind of love. For Murdoch, selfishness isn't about
trivial things like taking the last cupcake. It's about seeing the world in a way
that casts yourself as a star, and everyone else as secondary characters. To explain this, Murdoch tells the story
of a discontented mother-in-law. While the mother is always polite, she secretly feels her son made
a mistake marrying his "vulgar" and "tiresomely juvenile" wife. To Murdoch, this mother
is the picture of selfishness. By centering her own jealousy
and insecurity, she's reducing the nuanced reality
of her daughter-in-law to a caricature. But with some conscious effort, Murdoch believes the mother can learn to
see her daughter in law as she truly is— not vulgar or juvenile, but refreshingly straightforward
and delightfully youthful. To be clear, this doesn't mean the mother should simply don
rose-colored glasses. Love, as Murdoch defines it,
is "the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself
is real." As challenging as this might be, Murdoch believes we can all reach
this realization by cultivating what she calls attention. Partially inspired by Buddhist meditation, this practice could include engaging
with art, learning foreign languages, or simply taking the time to observe
the natural environment. What's important for Murdoch
is that the behavior helps direct your attention
beyond the self. Because only by practicing our ability
to attend to the world around us can we learn to see it as it truly is.

**Transcript**:
In the kitchen at a friend's party, you're in the midst of a profound
moral conundrum. Famous philosophers whisper
advice in your ear. Utilitarian John Stuart Mill tells you
that one should always strive to bring about the greatest happiness
for the greatest number of people. Aristotle reminds you of the importance
of the virtues of generosity and justice. But Thomas Hobbes points out that "of all voluntary acts,
the object is to every man his own good." In other words, human beings
are inherently selfish anyway. So why shouldn't you take
the last cupcake for yourself? This is actually one of philosophy's
oldest questions. Not your cupcake dilemma— the question of whether or not
human beings are inherently selfish. The idea that humans only act
out of self-interest is known as psychological egoism, and there aren't many philosophers
who endorse this extreme stance. There's simply too much evidence
of humans sacrificing their self-interest, and sometimes their very lives,
for the sake of others. And studies by psychologists have shown
that even very young children demonstrate helpful behavior despite
there being nothing in it for themselves. However, the idea that all humans
have a deep selfish streak is something many more philosophers
would agree with. German philosopher Immanuel Kant noted
that while we often seem to act for the sake of others, it's impossible to be sure
we're not truly motivated by "a secret impulse of self-love." For example, maybe when people make
large donations to charity, they're actually more interested
in looking good or benefiting from tax breaks
than helping others. It's worth noting that not all 
philosophers think self-love is always a bad thing. French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
identified two kinds of self-love. He believed "Amour de soi,"
our basic need for self-preservation, is natural and essential. But he identified "amour propre," our toxic desire for recognition
and social status, as the cause of many unjust disparities. In a similar vein, Aristotle argued
that humans are social beings who can only flourish when we seek
the good of others as well as ourselves. By this logic, true self-love requires us
to work against our selfish tendencies. For many philosophers,
this is where the real problem lies— how do we overcome our selfishness? Some, like Kant, have argued
that our sense of moral duty is what helps us rise
above our narrow self-interest. Others, like Rousseau and Adam Smith, contend that emotions
like pity and sympathy are what allow us to consider
the needs of others. But 20th century philosopher-novelist
Iris Murdoch believed the only true solution
to human selfishness was love. Or at least,
a certain kind of love. For Murdoch, selfishness isn't about
trivial things like taking the last cupcake. It's about seeing the world in a way
that casts yourself as a star, and everyone else as secondary characters. To explain this, Murdoch tells the story
of a discontented mother-in-law. While the mother is always polite, she secretly feels her son made
a mistake marrying his "vulgar" and "tiresomely juvenile" wife. To Murdoch, this mother
is the picture of selfishness. By centering her own jealousy
and insecurity, she's reducing the nuanced reality
of her daughter-in-law to a caricature. But with some conscious effort, Murdoch believes the mother can learn to
see her daughter in law as she truly is— not vulgar or juvenile, but refreshingly straightforward
and delightfully youthful. To be clear, this doesn't mean the mother should simply don
rose-colored glasses. Love, as Murdoch defines it,
is "the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself
is real." As challenging as this might be, Murdoch believes we can all reach
this realization by cultivating what she calls attention. Partially inspired by Buddhist meditation, this practice could include engaging
with art, learning foreign languages, or simply taking the time to observe
the natural environment. What's important for Murdoch
is that the behavior helps direct your attention
beyond the self. Because only by practicing our ability
to attend to the world around us can we learn to see it as it truly is.

**Transcript**:
Pharaoh Ramesses II reigned
for almost 70 years in the 13th century BCE. He presided over a golden age
of Egyptian prosperity. But was he a model leader, or a shameless egomaniac
and master of propaganda? Order! Order! Who do we have on the stand?
Ramesses II? Ahem, I believe you mean
"The strong bull, protector of Egypt, who subdues foreign lands; rich in years, great in victories,
chosen by Ra— whose justice is powerful— Ramesses, beloved of Amun." But you may refer to him
as Ramesses the Great. Ramesses, Ramesses— 
I think I've heard of him. "Let my people go!" Yes, Your Honor, he was the infamously
stubborn pharaoh of Exodus, who forced enslaved Hebrews to build out his extravagant capital city
of Pi-Ramesses. Objection, there's no
archaeological evidence that Ramesses used forced labor
in his construction projects. Egyptians relied on highly trained
artisans and craftsmen to build their cities and monuments. And menial labor,
like quarrying and moving stones, was done by military soldiers
and foreign mercenaries— all of whom were compensated
for their work. So he's not the pharaoh from Exodus? It's hard to say for certain. According to some timelines, Ramesses is the best candidate
for that particular pharaoh. But there's no evidence of any Hebrew
population in Egypt during his reign, and certainly no records of a revolution
or mass migration like the one described in Exodus. Is that really so surprising? It's not like Ramesses kept records
of any other time he was defeated. What do you mean? Our "great" pharaoh here operated
one of the largest propaganda machines in ancient history. Almost all pharaohs relied on propaganda
to control their country, and Ramesses had particularly
big sandals to fill. His father, Seti I, led Egypt to a period
of great wealth and stability that Ramesses worked hard to maintain. Through propaganda, yes,
but also military glory. More like military aggression. By the end of Seti's reign, he had established peace
with the neighboring Hittites by guaranteeing Egyptian control
over a sought-after region called Kadesh. But in the fifth year of his reign,
Ramesses broke those agreements. It wasn't the most peaceful decision, but Ramesses believed a military victory
would aid his efforts to restore Egypt's reputation. And he was right! His victory over the Hittites
cemented Ramesses' persona as a heroic pharaoh of old. Yeah, except he didn't even win! His supposed victory was
actually a stalemate in which the pharaoh's arrogance
almost cost Egypt the entire war. When two Hittite spies told Ramesses
the enemy had fled in fear, he let his guard down,
allowing his men to be ambushed. He played right into the Hittite's trap
and almost lost everything. Yet the official story Ramesses
had chiseled across Egypt cast himself as the battle's
greatest hero. Military achievements were important
for legitimizing a pharaoh's power, even if that meant a bit
of exaggeration. A bit? You can't trust
anything this guy says! If it wasn't for the Hittite's
conflicting record, we'd still be buying Ramesses' propaganda. I propose that this court cannot judge
any historical figure's legacy by the stories they tell about themselves. That seems reasonable to me. Fair enough. How's this record then— the first recorded peace treaty
in archaeological history signed by Ramesses and the Hittites. "Peace treaty" is pretty generous. Ramesses begrudgingly agreed
to a mutual defense contract, where Egyptians and Hittites would work
together if attacked by an external enemy. And what's wrong with that? This peaceful end to the conflict
marked the beginning of Ramesses' prosperous reign— a golden age of Egyptian power and wealth. True, but we have no idea if this wealth
trickled down to everyday Egyptians or just financed Ramesses' vain attempts
to achieve immortality through stone. He spent his entire reign pouring
money into ego projects. And one of the most famous,
Abu Simbel, wasn't even in Egypt! Abu Simbel was in Nubia to showcase
Egypt's strength and discourage a Nubian revolution. Besides, pharaohs were expected to invest
in building projects for the gods. Right, "for the gods,"
which Ramesses was not. Pharaohs typically occupied a status
between gods and mortals, but the location of Ramesses' statue
inside Abu Simbel positions him as their supposed equal. He even tore down existing temples
to reuse their bricks in monuments to himself! He tore down temples built by Akhenaten, a pharaoh who'd attempted
to impose monotheism. By destroying those temples, Ramesses reinforced his commitment
to Egypt's traditional religion. That doesn't account for why he frequently
erased other pharaohs' names on monuments and replaced them with his own. Hey, what the...? Even pharaohs who had short reigns
had numerous statues made of themselves— and Ramesses ruled
for almost seven decades. Well, he definitely made
a lasting impression. Let's face it, Your Honor, would we even
be talking about him today if he hadn't? It's often said that history is written
by the winners, but in this courtroom, a winning record never guarantees
the outcome.

of Egyptian prosperity. But was he a model leader, or a shameless egomaniac
and master of propaganda? Order! Order! Who do we have on the stand?
Ramesses II? Ahem, I believe you mean
"The strong bull, protector of Egypt, who subdues foreign lands; rich in years, great in victories,
chosen by Ra— whose justice is powerful— Ramesses, beloved of Amun." But you may refer to him
as Ramesses the Great. Ramesses, Ramesses— 
I think I've heard of him. "Let my people go!" Yes, Your Honor, he was the infamously
stubborn pharaoh of Exodus, who forced enslaved Hebrews to build out his extravagant capital city
of Pi-Ramesses. Objection, there's no
archaeological evidence that Ramesses used forced labor
in his construction projects. Egyptians relied on highly trained
artisans and craftsmen to build their cities and monuments. And menial labor,
like quarrying and moving stones, was done by military soldiers
and foreign mercenaries— all of whom were compensated
for their work. So he's not the pharaoh from Exodus? It's hard to say for certain. According to some timelines, Ramesses is the best candidate
for that particular pharaoh. But there's no evidence of any Hebrew
population in Egypt during his reign, and certainly no records of a revolution
or mass migration like the one described in Exodus. Is that really so surprising? It's not like Ramesses kept records
of any other time he was defeated. What do you mean? Our "great" pharaoh here operated
one of the largest propaganda machines in ancient history. Almost all pharaohs relied on propaganda
to control their country, and Ramesses had particularly
big sandals to fill. His father, Seti I, led Egypt to a period
of great wealth and stability that Ramesses worked hard to maintain. Through propaganda, yes,
but also military glory. More like military aggression. By the end of Seti's reign, he had established peace
with the neighboring Hittites by guaranteeing Egyptian control
over a sought-after region called Kadesh. But in the fifth year of his reign,
Ramesses broke those agreements. It wasn't the most peaceful decision, but Ramesses believed a military victory
would aid his efforts to restore Egypt's reputation. And he was right! His victory over the Hittites
cemented Ramesses' persona as a heroic pharaoh of old. Yeah, except he didn't even win! His supposed victory was
actually a stalemate in which the pharaoh's arrogance
almost cost Egypt the entire war. When two Hittite spies told Ramesses
the enemy had fled in fear, he let his guard down,
allowing his men to be ambushed. He played right into the Hittite's trap
and almost lost everything. Yet the official story Ramesses
had chiseled across Egypt cast himself as the battle's
greatest hero. Military achievements were important
for legitimizing a pharaoh's power, even if that meant a bit
of exaggeration. A bit? You can't trust
anything this guy says! If it wasn't for the Hittite's
conflicting record, we'd still be buying Ramesses' propaganda. I propose that this court cannot judge
any historical figure's legacy by the stories they tell about themselves. That seems reasonable to me. Fair enough. How's this record then— the first recorded peace treaty
in archaeological history signed by Ramesses and the Hittites. "Peace treaty" is pretty generous. Ramesses begrudgingly agreed
to a mutual defense contract, where Egyptians and Hittites would work
together if attacked by an external enemy. And what's wrong with that? This peaceful end to the conflict
marked the beginning of Ramesses' prosperous reign— a golden age of Egyptian power and wealth. True, but we have no idea if this wealth
trickled down to everyday Egyptians or just financed Ramesses' vain attempts
to achieve immortality through stone. He spent his entire reign pouring
money into ego projects. And one of the most famous,
Abu Simbel, wasn't even in Egypt! Abu Simbel was in Nubia to showcase
Egypt's strength and discourage a Nubian revolution. Besides, pharaohs were expected to invest
in building projects for the gods. Right, "for the gods,"
which Ramesses was not. Pharaohs typically occupied a status
between gods and mortals, but the location of Ramesses' statue
inside Abu Simbel positions him as their supposed equal. He even tore down existing temples
to reuse their bricks in monuments to himself! He tore down temples built by Akhenaten, a pharaoh who'd attempted
to impose monotheism. By destroying those temples, Ramesses reinforced his commitment
to Egypt's traditional religion. That doesn't account for why he frequently
erased other pharaohs' names on monuments and replaced them with his own. Hey, what the...? Even pharaohs who had short reigns
had numerous statues made of themselves— and Ramesses ruled

**Transcript**:
Surveying his vast domain, 
trident heavy in hand, Poseidon considers 
the prospect of retirement. What if someone else donned
the coral crown so he could spend his immortality
harmonizing with blue whales and cozying up to hydrothermal vents? Poseidon decides he needs to actually
prioritize himself for once. So he summons his accountant and asks: how much could he sell
the ocean for today? Poseidon’s accountant is the
top-ranked financial analyst to the world’s movers and shakers, its literal titans of industry. He handles all divine assets. When it comes to boiling complex systems
of intrinsic value down to monetary sums, he’s the guy. And he’s actually got a potential buyer: Hades is interested in building
his real estate portfolio and expanding his domain
into the marine realm. So, the accountant already appraised
the ocean’s market value and prepared a quick presentation. "The property covers
over 70% of Earth’s surface. But it’s also quite voluminous!" Poseidon knows this. He does annual Mariana Trench
swims with sea cucumbers. But before he even gets
to his best giant squid story, the accountant is back at analysis. "Marine shipping alone accounts
for 80% of global trade, generating over $14 trillion annually. The global fishing industry 
provides over 3 billion people with a significant amount 
of their dietary protein, employs an estimated 260 million, and generates about $163 billion
every year. And oil and budding
seabed mining industries generate around $245 billion per year." "Some of the ocean’s assets
are harder to quantify monetarily. The ocean absorbs around 30%
of human generated carbon dioxide, and, since 1955, has taken
in more than 90% of excess heat. About 40% of humanity lives
within 100 kilometers of the ocean. Coastal ecosystems buffer waves,
reduce erosion, and ease flooding, preventing over $716 billion
in damages annually. Many cultures have deep ties to the ocean. And coastal views and recreation
improve mental health. Meanwhile, it's estimated
that as-yet undiscovered marine-derived cancer treatments
could save countless lives and be worth up to $5.7 trillion. The ocean generates half
the planet’s oxygen and, directly or indirectly, provides food, energy, and minerals
to all life on Earth." A salty tear cascades down Poseidon’s face
that the accountant ignores. He can’t give the total cost yet
because, of course, recent developments must be factored in. "Climate change is heating, acidifying,
and deoxygenating the ocean and trash is polluting it. Overfishing and aggressive 
seabed resource extraction are disrupting fragile ecosystems
and impacting the ocean’s productivity." The accountant says, "Sigh, buddy,
you shouldn’t worry, though, because we can grow
the ocean’s investment value. Coral reef tourism already yields
approximately $36 billion annually. Considering the revenue
of popular dive sites and their regional shark
populations and lifespans, researchers estimate that one shark can
generate almost $2 million in its lifetime— making them much more valuable
alive than dead. Sustainable management of fisheries
could allow species to rebound and bring in an additional
$83 billion annually. And with growth in offshore wind, 
tidal, and wave energy harvesting, the ocean is poised to help
humanity quit fossil fuels." Now the grand reveal. The accountant's conclusions are similar
to those of mortal experts: the ocean alone is worth
roughly $24 trillion— at least— about a quarter
of the World Bank’s valuation of the global economy in 2021. But if humanity reinvests
in the ocean's health— fishing sustainably,
decarbonizing shipping, scaling offshore wind farms,
and conserving and restoring mangroves— investments could return
up to 600% in profits. Poseidon feels the weight of his folly
crushing him like a Styrofoam cup 2,000 meters deep. Reducing such a priceless, generously
life-giving natural system to a number is just another symptom of the greatest
problems he’s facing nowadays. And though he respects the work
his brother, Hades, does, he doesn't want the ocean to become
an extension of the Underworld. He can’t give it up. Poseidon asks forgiveness and reaffirms his eternal vow
to protect the ocean. It’ll take him a few tidal cycles
to realize Hades and the accountant were bluffing 
and see what this really was: a much-needed intervention by a duo
of deities who cared deeply about him— and the world.

**Transcript**:
Surveying his vast domain, 
trident heavy in hand, Poseidon considers 
the prospect of retirement. What if someone else donned
the coral crown so he could spend his immortality
harmonizing with blue whales and cozying up to hydrothermal vents? Poseidon decides he needs to actually
prioritize himself for once. So he summons his accountant and asks: how much could he sell
the ocean for today? Poseidon’s accountant is the
top-ranked financial analyst to the world’s movers and shakers, its literal titans of industry. He handles all divine assets. When it comes to boiling complex systems
of intrinsic value down to monetary sums, he’s the guy. And he’s actually got a potential buyer: Hades is interested in building
his real estate portfolio and expanding his domain
into the marine realm. So, the accountant already appraised
the ocean’s market value and prepared a quick presentation. "The property covers
over 70% of Earth’s surface. But it’s also quite voluminous!" Poseidon knows this. He does annual Mariana Trench
swims with sea cucumbers. But before he even gets
to his best giant squid story, the accountant is back at analysis. "Marine shipping alone accounts
for 80% of global trade, generating over $14 trillion annually. The global fishing industry 
provides over 3 billion people with a significant amount 
of their dietary protein, employs an estimated 260 million, and generates about $163 billion
every year. And oil and budding
seabed mining industries generate around $245 billion per year." "Some of the ocean’s assets
are harder to quantify monetarily. The ocean absorbs around 30%
of human generated carbon dioxide, and, since 1955, has taken
in more than 90% of excess heat. About 40% of humanity lives
within 100 kilometers of the ocean. Coastal ecosystems buffer waves,
reduce erosion, and ease flooding, preventing over $716 billion
in damages annually. Many cultures have deep ties to the ocean. And coastal views and recreation
improve mental health. Meanwhile, it's estimated
that as-yet undiscovered marine-derived cancer treatments
could save countless lives and be worth up to $5.7 trillion. The ocean generates half
the planet’s oxygen and, directly or indirectly, provides food, energy, and minerals
to all life on Earth." A salty tear cascades down Poseidon’s face
that the accountant ignores. He can’t give the total cost yet
because, of course, recent developments must be factored in. "Climate change is heating, acidifying,
and deoxygenating the ocean and trash is polluting it. Overfishing and aggressive 
seabed resource extraction are disrupting fragile ecosystems
and impacting the ocean’s productivity." The accountant says, "Sigh, buddy,
you shouldn’t worry, though, because we can grow
the ocean’s investment value. Coral reef tourism already yields
approximately $36 billion annually. Considering the revenue
of popular dive sites and their regional shark
populations and lifespans, researchers estimate that one shark can
generate almost $2 million in its lifetime— making them much more valuable
alive than dead. Sustainable management of fisheries
could allow species to rebound and bring in an additional
$83 billion annually. And with growth in offshore wind, 
tidal, and wave energy harvesting, the ocean is poised to help
humanity quit fossil fuels." Now the grand reveal. The accountant's conclusions are similar
to those of mortal experts: the ocean alone is worth
roughly $24 trillion— at least— about a quarter
of the World Bank’s valuation of the global economy in 2021. But if humanity reinvests
in the ocean's health— fishing sustainably,
decarbonizing shipping, scaling offshore wind farms,
and conserving and restoring mangroves— investments could return
up to 600% in profits. Poseidon feels the weight of his folly
crushing him like a Styrofoam cup 2,000 meters deep. Reducing such a priceless, generously
life-giving natural system to a number is just another symptom of the greatest
problems he’s facing nowadays. And though he respects the work
his brother, Hades, does, he doesn't want the ocean to become
an extension of the Underworld. He can’t give it up. Poseidon asks forgiveness and reaffirms his eternal vow
to protect the ocean. It’ll take him a few tidal cycles
to realize Hades and the accountant were bluffing 
and see what this really was: a much-needed intervention by a duo
of deities who cared deeply about him— and the world.

If you were to place all the rice consumed
each year on one side of a scale, and every person in the world
on the other, the scale would tip heavily
towards rice's favor. This beloved crop contributes over 20% of
the calories consumed by humans each year. Korean bibimbap, Nigerian jollof,
Indian biryani, Spanish paella, and countless other culinary masterpieces
all begin with rice. So how did this humble grain
end up in so many cuisines? The roots of rice go back thousands
of years to when early farmers in Asia, Africa, and South America
each independently domesticated the crop. First came Asian rice, which many plant geneticists believe
originated in what's now China. Over 10,000 years ago,
nomadic hunters in the region began gathering and eating seeds
from a weedy grass. Then, around 9,000 years ago,
they started planting these seeds, prompting nomadic hunters to settle
into farming communities. With each harvest, growers selected
and replanted seeds from the rice plants
that pleased them most— like those with bigger and more plentiful
grains or aromatic flavors. Over millennia, thousands of varieties
of Asian rice emerged. A relative of the same weedy grass
was also domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago. Today, its growth is mostly limited
to West Africa. South American growers also domesticated
rice around 4,000 years ago, though the crop was lost
after the arrival of Europeans. Asian rice, however, spread widely, and is now a cornerstone of diet
and culture in Asia and beyond. In India and Nepal, many Hindus mark
an infant's transition to solid foods with a ceremony known as Annaprashan, where the baby tastes rice
for the first time. in Japan, rice is so central to diets
that the word "gohan" means both "cooked rice" and "meal." The global expansion of rice cultivation
was only possible because the plant can grow
in many climates— from tropical to temperate. As a semi-aquatic plant, rice happily
grows in submerged soils. Many other crops can't survive
in standing water because their root cells rely on air
within soil to access oxygen. But rice plants have air channels
in their roots that allow oxygen to travel from the leaves and stems
to the submerged tissues. Traditionally, growers plant
rice in paddy fields— flat land submerged under as much
as 10 centimeters of water throughout the growing season. This practice returns high yields
since many competing weeds can't hack it in the aquatic environment. But the technique is also water intensive. Rice covers 11% of global cropland, but uses over a third
of the world's irrigation water. This form of rice production
also pumps out a surprising amount
of greenhouse gas emissions. Flooded fields are the perfect breeding
grounds for microorganisms known as methanogens. These microscopic lifeforms thrive
in environments lacking oxygen, because they evolved when the Earth
contained little of this gas. Methanogens are the only organisms
known to produce methane— a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent
than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Cows, for example, are infamous
for burping out methane due to methanogens in their stomachs. In a flooded paddy field, methanogens set
to work eating away at organic material in the submerged soil
and multiplying rapidly, all the while releasing copious amounts
of methane. The result: rice cultivation
contributes around 12% of human-caused methane
emissions each year. But there's good news. Rice doesn't actually need to grow
in continuously flooded paddies. Researchers and growers are exploring
water management strategies that can cut the methane
while keeping the yield. One promising technique is known
as alternate wetting and drying. Growers periodically let
the water level drop, which keeps methanogen growth in check. Alternate wetting and drying
can cut water use by 30% and methane emissions
by 30 to 70% without impacting yield. Greenhouse gases come from many—
sometimes unexpected— places. Making rice growing more sustainable
is just one of the many challenges we'll need to face
to avoid catastrophic warming. Today, many rice growers still
flood fields all season long. Changing millennia-old practices
requires a major mindset shift. But going against the grain could be
just what we need to keep our planet healthy
and our bowls full.

originated in what's now China. Over 10,000 years ago,
nomadic hunters in the region began gathering and eating seeds
from a weedy grass. Then, around 9,000 years ago,
they started planting these seeds, prompting nomadic hunters to settle
into farming communities. With each harvest, growers selected
and replanted seeds from the rice plants
that pleased them most— like those with bigger and more plentiful
grains or aromatic flavors. Over millennia, thousands of varieties
of Asian rice emerged. A relative of the same weedy grass
was also domesticated in Africa around 3,000 years ago. Today, its growth is mostly limited
to West Africa. South American growers also domesticated
rice around 4,000 years ago, though the crop was lost
after the arrival of Europeans. Asian rice, however, spread widely, and is now a cornerstone of diet
and culture in Asia and beyond. In India and Nepal, many Hindus mark
an infant's transition to solid foods with a ceremony known as Annaprashan, where the baby tastes rice
for the first time. in Japan, rice is so central to diets
that the word "gohan" means both "cooked rice" and "meal." The global expansion of rice cultivation
was only possible because the plant can grow
in many climates— from tropical to temperate. As a semi-aquatic plant, rice happily
grows in submerged soils. Many other crops can't survive
in standing water because their root cells rely on air
within soil to access oxygen. But rice plants have air channels
in their roots that allow oxygen to travel from the leaves and stems
to the submerged tissues. Traditionally, growers plant
rice in paddy fields— flat land submerged under as much
as 10 centimeters of water throughout the growing season. This practice returns high yields
since many competing weeds can't hack it in the aquatic environment. But the technique is also water intensive. Rice covers 11% of global cropland, but uses over a third
of the world's irrigation water. This form of rice production
also pumps out a surprising amount
of greenhouse gas emissions. Flooded fields are the perfect breeding
grounds for microorganisms known as methanogens. These microscopic lifeforms thrive
in environments lacking oxygen, because they evolved when the Earth
contained little of this gas. Methanogens are the only organisms
known to produce methane— a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent
than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Cows, for example, are infamous
for burping out methane due to methanogens in their stomachs. In a flooded paddy field, methanogens set
to work eating away at organic material in the submerged soil
and multiplying rapidly, all the while releasing copious amounts
of methane. The result: rice cultivation
contributes around 12% of human-caused methane
emissions each year. But there's good news. Rice doesn't actually need to grow
in continuously flooded paddies. Researchers and growers are exploring
water management strategies that can cut the methane
while keeping the yield. One promising technique is known
as alternate wetting and drying. Growers periodically let
the water level drop, which keeps methanogen growth in check. Alternate wetting and drying
can cut water use by 30% and methane emissions
by 30 to 70% without impacting yield. Greenhouse gases come from many—
sometimes unexpected— places. Making rice growing more sustainable
is just one of the many challenges we'll need to face
to avoid catastrophic warming. Today, many rice growers still
flood fields all season long. Changing millennia-old practices
requires a major mindset shift. But going against the grain could be
just what we need to keep our planet healthy
and our bowls full.

If you were to place all the rice consumed
each year on one side of a scale, and every person in the world
on the other, the scale would tip heavily
towards rice's favor. This beloved crop contributes over 20% of
the calories consumed by humans each year. Korean bibimbap, Nigerian jollof,
Indian biryani, Spanish paella, and countless other culinary masterpieces
all begin with rice. So how did this humble grain
end up in so many cuisines? The roots of rice go back thousands
of years to when early farmers in Asia, Africa, and South America

**Transcript**:
In the late 1930s, a grand panda drama
unfolded at the Chicago Zoo. Su-Lin, who had been a media darling
since she was a cub, passed away. Zookeepers were already in the process of procuring another female panda
named Mei Mei, and they were determined to find her
a mate before tragedy struck again. So when they acquired a prospective suitor
named Mei Lan, it seemed their troubles were over. Magazines monitored their progress, and the public eagerly awaited
the patter of tiny panda paws. But the wait dragged on. At first, headlines declared that Mei Mei
was "getting nowhere" with her love life. But eventually zookeepers realized
their significant slip-up: both bears were male. This is just one of many mistakes humans
have made when it comes to pandas. We've incorrectly classified
them as raccoons, misrepresented them as cuddly vegetarians, and— since the doomed union
of Mei Mei and Mei Lan— declared them as incompetent lovers. Some people have taken this even further, suggesting it's remarkable
this sex-shy species has been able to sustain
themselves at all. However, this common perception of pandas
having low libidos actually has more to do
with human incompetence. When it comes to breeding pandas
in captivity, zookeepers face multiple challenges. As the Chicago case suggests, it can be
tricky to figure out a panda's sex. Their external genitals don't appear
until they're a few months old, and once visible, they look very similar. This forces zookeepers to rely
on inconsistent methods, like trying to measure the distance
between the anus and genitals, or simply going by feel. And even when males and females
are paired up correctly, chemistry isn't guaranteed. In one case at the Moscow Zoo, a female bear that had been isolated
from other animals proved more interested in zookeepers
than other pandas. Complicating things further, female pandas can only be impregnated
1 to 3 days each year due to their incredibly short
ovulation window. Zookeepers try to track fertility levels
by measuring the hormones in their urine, but this data is often cryptic to decipher
and messy to capture. Females have also evolved the ability
to reabsorb their own fetuses, meaning that even a successful
impregnation can be reversed. The difficulty of breeding pandas
has reinforced the idea that they're not naturally
inclined to procreate. But there's a huge gap between how these
animals behave in captivity and the privacy of the wild. Prowling through her home territory, a female panda rubs her anal glands
on tree trunks to attract mates, then waits in the treetops
bleating as loudly as she can. Soon enough, males crowd around the tree
and compete for her attention by seeing who can pee the highest. Suitors adopt a variety of poses
in these competitions, including the "squat," "legcock,"
and "handstand." They're also known to dab urine
behind their ears to broadcast their virility
through the breeze. Once a female picks a winner, the mating pair will often have sex
over 40 times in a single afternoon. At these rates, you might expect
panda populations to be booming, especially since panda sperm
is incredibly potent. But females' short ovulation cycles
and ability to reabsorb fetuses keep the population in check. In the wild, young pandas are usually able
to witness at least one breeding season before reaching sexual maturity, giving them time to learn
the rituals of seduction. But in captivity, pandas are never
able to learn these customs. And while breeders have tried to kick
start young pandas' sexual awakenings by showing them footage of mating elders
and offering them doses of Viagra, none of these strategies have
worked consistently. The most reliable approach they've
found is artificial insemination, which has dramatically increased
the captive population in the past few decades. But if pandas are so much better
at reproducing in the wild, one has to ask why are conservation
efforts so focused on breeding them. Maybe our time would be better spent protecting the pandas'
natural environments, giving them all the space they need
to get down to business.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why were Mei Mei and Mei Lan unsuccessful mates at the Chicago Zoo?

**Transcript**:
In the late 1930s, a grand panda drama
unfolded at the Chicago Zoo. Su-Lin, who had been a media darling
since she was a cub, passed away. Zookeepers were already in the process of procuring another female panda
named Mei Mei, and they were determined to find her
a mate before tragedy struck again. So when they acquired a prospective suitor
named Mei Lan, it seemed their troubles were over. Magazines monitored their progress, and the public eagerly awaited
the patter of tiny panda paws. But the wait dragged on. At first, headlines declared that Mei Mei
was "getting nowhere" with her love life. But eventually zookeepers realized
their significant slip-up: both bears were male. This is just one of many mistakes humans
have made when it comes to pandas. We've incorrectly classified
them as raccoons, misrepresented them as cuddly vegetarians, and— since the doomed union
of Mei Mei and Mei Lan— declared them as incompetent lovers. Some people have taken this even further, suggesting it's remarkable
this sex-shy species has been able to sustain
themselves at all. However, this common perception of pandas
having low libidos actually has more to do
with human incompetence. When it comes to breeding pandas
in captivity, zookeepers face multiple challenges. As the Chicago case suggests, it can be
tricky to figure out a panda's sex. Their external genitals don't appear
until they're a few months old, and once visible, they look very similar. This forces zookeepers to rely
on inconsistent methods, like trying to measure the distance
between the anus and genitals, or simply going by feel. And even when males and females
are paired up correctly, chemistry isn't guaranteed. In one case at the Moscow Zoo, a female bear that had been isolated
from other animals proved more interested in zookeepers
than other pandas. Complicating things further, female pandas can only be impregnated
1 to 3 days each year due to their incredibly short
ovulation window. Zookeepers try to track fertility levels
by measuring the hormones in their urine, but this data is often cryptic to decipher
and messy to capture. Females have also evolved the ability
to reabsorb their own fetuses, meaning that even a successful
impregnation can be reversed. The difficulty of breeding pandas
has reinforced the idea that they're not naturally
inclined to procreate. But there's a huge gap between how these
animals behave in captivity and the privacy of the wild. Prowling through her home territory, a female panda rubs her anal glands
on tree trunks to attract mates, then waits in the treetops
bleating as loudly as she can. Soon enough, males crowd around the tree
and compete for her attention by seeing who can pee the highest. Suitors adopt a variety of poses
in these competitions, including the "squat," "legcock,"
and "handstand." They're also known to dab urine
behind their ears to broadcast their virility
through the breeze. Once a female picks a winner, the mating pair will often have sex
over 40 times in a single afternoon. At these rates, you might expect
panda populations to be booming, especially since panda sperm
is incredibly potent. But females' short ovulation cycles
and ability to reabsorb fetuses keep the population in check. In the wild, young pandas are usually able
to witness at least one breeding season before reaching sexual maturity, giving them time to learn
the rituals of seduction. But in captivity, pandas are never
able to learn these customs. And while breeders have tried to kick
start young pandas' sexual awakenings by showing them footage of mating elders
and offering them doses of Viagra, none of these strategies have
worked consistently. The most reliable approach they've
found is artificial insemination, which has dramatically increased
the captive population in the past few decades. But if pandas are so much better
at reproducing in the wild, one has to ask why are conservation
efforts so focused on breeding them. Maybe our time would be better spent protecting the pandas'
natural environments, giving them all the space they need
to get down to business.

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. Today I’m going to teach you how to read. Which 
is something that you already know how to do,   obviously, but you probably have no 
idea how you’re actually doing it. But first I need to let you in on a secret: There’s a trick being played on 
you every time you read something. In fact it’s right in front of 
you right now. Do you see it? Let’s take a closer look at just a couple 
of letters and see if you can see it then.  Here’s just the C and T. These two 
letters are exactly the same weight,   or “size” in this typeface, so you’d 
figure they’re the exact same height.   But watch what happens when I lay them on top 
of each other. The C is ever-so-slightly taller. It’s true for other letter pairs 
too. Like E and S. The S is taller. It’s even true for other typefaces, like this one.  Letters that look the same size 
are actually… not the same size. And this… is on purpose. Because if they actually were the 
same size, mathematically speaking they wouldn’t look the same size. Letters with rounded tops have to be slightly 
taller than letters with flat tops in order for   them to appear the same size.
This illusion is hiding   in just about everything you’ve ever read.
Yes, it’s even in Comic Sans!  Your letters are lying to 
you! But if this illusion   wasn’t there, words would look really weird. And that’s because we don’t read with a ruler.   We read with our brain. And 
our brains like to lie to us. The reason all this happens is related to 
another illusion that maybe you’ve seen before. This line appears longer than this one. But 
in reality the two lines are the same length. This is one of the most famous 
illusions in visual science.   And there’s lots of different versions 
of it. I mean, this is one of the most   powerful illusions I’ve ever seen. Even 
when you know the lines are the same length,   it doesn’t change the story your brain tells you.
It’s really weird! So what does this have to do with letters? Well, we can explain what’s happening here if we turn the Müller-Lyer illusion on its side: This line, with its ends, 
looks kinda like the letter O. The other line is more like an I or a T. Our brains decide round letters like O look 
smaller than more squared off letters nearby,   so we have to make the O bigger 
just to look the same size.  So that’s a really cool 
illusion that fools you probably   hundreds of times a day. And it shows us 
that there’s a lot more going on with how   we recognize letters and words and turn 
them into meaning than you might expect. In other words: Reading is really weird. Now, a good reader can recognize 
hundreds of words per minute. And once you learn how to do it, most of us 
don’t have to actually think about reading. It just happens. But while it feels automatic, there’s 
a lot going on under the hood. Or under the skull really. You’re just not consciously aware of any of it. When ya think about it it’s actually 
pretty weird that we can read at all. I mean, our brains evolved, pretty much in their 
current form, a hundred thousand years ago or so. But writing is only a few thousand years old.  And standardized movable type, that was only 
invented like one thousand years ago, in Asia. And then Gutenberg invented 
it again like 600 years ago. I mean think about this: As recently as the 1800s 
maybe 1 in 8 people actually knew how to read. It’s clearly not something that we evolved 
to do. But we can. So what’s up with that? Luckily I happen to know a language expert, and 
she just so happens to have her own YouTube show.   So I asked her.
Thanks, Joe! I’m   Dr. Erica Brozovsky, sociolinguist and 
certified word nerd. On my show Otherwords, we delve into the amazing facets 
of human language,   and the ability to read is 
one that almost defies logic. How can a brain that evolved like a hundred 
thousand of years ago be so naturally good   at a skill that we only invented 5,000 years 
ago? It’s been called the “paradox of reading” The answer may be that we’ve repurposed 
some existing brain functions for new uses.   It’s a theory neuroscientist Stanislas 
Dehaene called "neural recycling" By studying the neural patterns of monkeys, 
scientists have been able to identify how   their brains identify and make sense of the 
contours and lines that make up visual scenes.   A corner here, an edge there, some intersecting 
edges here. And it seems like there’s a basic   "alphabet" of simple shapes that their brains 
use to decode any number of possible scenes. What’s interesting is these shapes are 
remarkably similar to the strokes that   make up most human writing. Whenever one 
object is behind another, you get a T   shape. Corners of objects 
make L's and F's and Y's. And an O can be found in anything from a 
delicious fruit… to the eye of a predator. What these shapes have in common is that 
they're "non-accidental". If you threw a bunch   of toothpicks on the floor, very rarely would 
three land with their ends perfectly touching.   So if you see this pattern in real life… 
it's probably worth paying attention to,   and our brains are especially 
adept at spotting it. Each pattern in this “shape 
alphabet” triggers neurons,   and when certain combinations 
of neurons fire together,   they trigger higher order neurons that help 
us eventually decode the meaning of an image. So this combination from our shape 
alphabet triggers the meaning   “cat”. And so does this combination.
Only, one is a group of shapes in nature,   and one is just a collection of lines on paper. Early alphabets that used such shapes allowed 
more people to read, and let them read faster,   eventually replacing cumbersome pictographic 
writing systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics.   As Dehaene says, "...our cortex did 
not specifically evolve for writing…   writing evolved to fit the cortex." That… is amazing. So let’s take a closer look at what’s happening   when your brain decodes all these shapes 
and tries to make meaning out of them. How do we read?! One thing that we know about reading   is that your brain isn’t sounding 
out words as you scan the page, like   speaking them in your head. I mean, you might 
be able to make yourself consciously do that… One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish That’s not how it works. When you read, your brain is directly 
turning those printed symbols into meaning. Now, words are made of letters. And we’ve already seen that we’re really   sensitive to the shapes combinations of 
letters have when they’re put together. So the big question to figure out is: When we 
recognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?
Or do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see 
an elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, 
tusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing 
and say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question 
out, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of 
people for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized 
the whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either 
real words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized 
some particular letter   And people recognized the right letter 
better when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our 
brains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. 
The “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think 
about how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or 
combinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect 
says that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. 
We just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we 
recognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it 
analyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the 
word “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to 
read lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible 
at reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned 
out to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you 
scan a page. But they’re not scanning   smoothly across lines of text. They jump 
around. Sometimes they even jump backwards. These little movements are 
called saccades. And they’re   really fast. One jump takes 20 to 35 milliseconds. 
Around 10 times faster than the blink of an eye. You don’t even notice this jumping because 
it happens so fast it doesn’t even have time   to register in your brain. But why can’t we see 
those jumps? Does anyone know a neuroscientist?! So here’s the crazy thing about saccades: 
Your eyes are jumping around about   three times a second, and in between 
that they're making these little micro   saccades, they're making little tiny jitters. But you can't see the whole world streaking by.   Why not? Well it's because when your 
eyes go on this ballistic jump if we   were actually seeing that it would look like 
the world is streaking around all the time So we don't experience that. Instead we 
just experience the world out there. Why? It's a very deep reason actually. 
It's because all you're ever seeing   is your internal model of the outside 
world. You're not seeing the world as it is. Because it actually takes time for your 
eye to move from one place to another.   So what happened to that time? Well it turns out   your brain says okay i'm going to fill 
in the gap with whatever I land on. When your eyes land on the thing 
you've got this gap in time and so your brain 
essentially  retrospectively fills that in. Thanks David Eagleman! Your eyes stop 
on a word for about 200 milliseconds,   then they jump forward 7 to 9 letters.
But somehow your eyes never land in between words. And some types of words: like short words 
or connector words like “the” and “and” Your eyes just skip right over them altogether. Now, how much information we gather each time 
our eyes stop is limited by how our eye is built. The fovea is the area in the center of your vision 
where the photoreceptors are most densely packed,   and where your vision is the sharpest. It 
senses an area about the size of your fingertip   at arm’s length. Around that is 
an area called the parafovea.   The photoreceptors are less dense, and it can 
see some details but things are kinda fuzzy.   And beyond that is basically your peripheral 
vision, where the photoreceptors can basically   just tell that there’s something there, but 
are absolutely terrible at figuring out what. Each time your eyes stop, 
in that split second you’re   gathering information from three different zones. In the center, your fovea clearly 
identifies 3 to 4 letters around   where your eyes stop. This is usually 
enough to recognize that single word. The second zone is in the 
parafovea. It’s much more blurry,   but can get at least a hint at what the 
first few letters of the next word are. And beyond that is an even blurrier zone. No 
letters being identified here, but importantly   you are sensing how long the next word or two is. This gives you enough information to decide 
where your eyes will move next. If the next   word is short and can be skipped, or whether it’s 
long and unfamiliar so you should stop on it. While you are recognizing the word you 
are actually looking at and focusing on,   another part of your eye is already reading 
ahead to tell you what’s coming next.  All in all your eyes only stop on 
about 60% of the words you read. Yet   somehow you still read all of them. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU’RE DOING THIS. So we seem to recognize words not because of their 
shape, but because of the letters they contain.   Which maybe isn’t that surprising,   except we’re seeing most of those 
letters without actually looking at them. We think the way we recognize 
words works something like this:   When your eyes land on or near a word, say SOAP,   you see ALL the letters, that is, you process 
their shapes - basically simultaneously. You don’t scan the letters 
from left to right one by one,   as if your brain is looking 
up a word in a dictionary. You know, the first letter "s" the second 
letter "o" . . . it doesn’t work that way. Your brain simultaneously compares   each letter position with those in 
all the words you’ve seen before. Think of your mental dictionary as a pool 
full of words. Every word with one letter   in common gets a little jolt in your brain’s 
neural networks and floats above the rest.  The words with two letters in common get a 
bigger jolt in your brain and rise above those. Then the words with three letters 
in common get an even bigger jolt. Until finally, the strongest signal in the 
neural network of your brain’s dictionary   rises to the top, and that’s the 
winner: The word you recognize. This happens over and over as your eyes 
jump from spot to spot across the page,   taking in different kinds of information from 
various parts of your eye, unconsciously reading   ahead in your brain, activating countless neural 
networks, all in less than a quarter of a second.   And then you move your eyes, and do it again, 
and again, and again. All thanks to some ancient   evolutionary ability you have to recognize 
certain shapes, curves, and corners.  And the coolest part of all this is 
the next time you pick up a book,   you won’t even think about 
any of this. You’ll just   enjoy a good story. As long as the I’s 
and the O’s are the right size at least… Stay curious. And as always, a huge thank you to

**Transcript**:
Hey smart people, Joe here. Today I’m going to teach you how to read. Which 
is something that you already know how to do,   obviously, but you probably have no 
idea how you’re actually doing it. But first I need to let you in on a secret: There’s a trick being played on 
you every time you read something. In fact it’s right in front of 
you right now. Do you see it? Let’s take a closer look at just a couple 
of letters and see if you can see it then.  Here’s just the C and T. These two 
letters are exactly the same weight,   or “size” in this typeface, so you’d 
figure they’re the exact same height.   But watch what happens when I lay them on top 
of each other. The C is ever-so-slightly taller. It’s true for other letter pairs 
too. Like E and S. The S is taller. It’s even true for other typefaces, like this one.  Letters that look the same size 
are actually… not the same size. And this… is on purpose. Because if they actually were the 
same size, mathematically speaking they wouldn’t look the same size. Letters with rounded tops have to be slightly 
taller than letters with flat tops in order for   them to appear the same size.
This illusion is hiding   in just about everything you’ve ever read.
Yes, it’s even in Comic Sans!  Your letters are lying to 
you! But if this illusion   wasn’t there, words would look really weird. And that’s because we don’t read with a ruler.   We read with our brain. And 
our brains like to lie to us. The reason all this happens is related to 
another illusion that maybe you’ve seen before. This line appears longer than this one. But 
in reality the two lines are the same length. This is one of the most famous 
illusions in visual science.   And there’s lots of different versions 
of it. I mean, this is one of the most   powerful illusions I’ve ever seen. Even 
when you know the lines are the same length,   it doesn’t change the story your brain tells you.
It’s really weird! So what does this have to do with letters? Well, we can explain what’s happening here if we turn the Müller-Lyer illusion on its side: This line, with its ends, 
looks kinda like the letter O. The other line is more like an I or a T. Our brains decide round letters like O look 
smaller than more squared off letters nearby,   so we have to make the O bigger 
just to look the same size.  So that’s a really cool 
illusion that fools you probably   hundreds of times a day. And it shows us 
that there’s a lot more going on with how   we recognize letters and words and turn 
them into meaning than you might expect. In other words: Reading is really weird. Now, a good reader can recognize 
hundreds of words per minute. And once you learn how to do it, most of us 
don’t have to actually think about reading. It just happens. But while it feels automatic, there’s 
a lot going on under the hood. Or under the skull really. You’re just not consciously aware of any of it. When ya think about it it’s actually 
pretty weird that we can read at all. I mean, our brains evolved, pretty much in their 
current form, a hundred thousand years ago or so. But writing is only a few thousand years old.  And standardized movable type, that was only 
invented like one thousand years ago, in Asia. And then Gutenberg invented 
it again like 600 years ago. I mean think about this: As recently as the 1800s 
maybe 1 in 8 people actually knew how to read. It’s clearly not something that we evolved 
to do. But we can. So what’s up with that? Luckily I happen to know a language expert, and 
she just so happens to have her own YouTube show.   So I asked her.
Thanks, Joe! I’m   Dr. Erica Brozovsky, sociolinguist and 
certified word nerd. On my show Otherwords, we delve into the amazing facets 
of human language,   and the ability to read is 
one that almost defies logic. How can a brain that evolved like a hundred 
thousand of years ago be so naturally good   at a skill that we only invented 5,000 years 
ago? It’s been called the “paradox of reading” The answer may be that we’ve repurposed 
some existing brain functions for new uses.   It’s a theory neuroscientist Stanislas 
Dehaene called "neural recycling" By studying the neural patterns of monkeys, 
scientists have been able to identify how   their brains identify and make sense of the 
contours and lines that make up visual scenes.   A corner here, an edge there, some intersecting 
edges here. And it seems like there’s a basic   "alphabet" of simple shapes that their brains 
use to decode any number of possible scenes. What’s interesting is these shapes are 
remarkably similar to the strokes that   make up most human writing. Whenever one 
object is behind another, you get a T   shape. Corners of objects 
make L's and F's and Y's. And an O can be found in anything from a 
delicious fruit… to the eye of a predator. What these shapes have in common is that 
they're "non-accidental". If you threw a bunch   of toothpicks on the floor, very rarely would 
three land with their ends perfectly touching.   So if you see this pattern in real life… 
it's probably worth paying attention to,   and our brains are especially 
adept at spotting it. Each pattern in this “shape 
alphabet” triggers neurons,   and when certain combinations 
of neurons fire together,   they trigger higher order neurons that help 
us eventually decode the meaning of an image. So this combination from our shape 
alphabet triggers the meaning   “cat”. And so does this combination.
Only, one is a group of shapes in nature,   and one is just a collection of lines on paper. Early alphabets that used such shapes allowed 
more people to read, and let them read faster,   eventually replacing cumbersome pictographic 
writing systems like Egyptian hieroglyphics.   As Dehaene says, "...our cortex did 
not specifically evolve for writing…   writing evolved to fit the cortex." That… is amazing. So let’s take a closer look at what’s happening   when your brain decodes all these shapes 
and tries to make meaning out of them. How do we read?! One thing that we know about reading   is that your brain isn’t sounding 
out words as you scan the page, like   speaking them in your head. I mean, you might 
be able to make yourself consciously do that… One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish That’s not how it works. When you read, your brain is directly 
turning those printed symbols into meaning. Now, words are made of letters. And we’ve already seen that we’re really   sensitive to the shapes combinations of 
letters have when they’re put together. So the big question to figure out is: When we 
recognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?
Or do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see 
an elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, 
tusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing 
and say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question 
out, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of 
people for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized 
the whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either 
real words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized 
some particular letter   And people recognized the right letter 
better when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our 
brains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. 
The “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think 
about how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or 
combinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect 
says that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. 
We just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we 
recognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it 
analyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the 
word “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to 
read lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible 
at reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned 
out to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you 
scan a page. But they’re not scanning   smoothly across lines of text. They jump 
around. Sometimes they even jump backwards. These little movements are 
called saccades. And they’re   really fast. One jump takes 20 to 35 milliseconds. 
Around 10 times faster than the blink of an eye. You don’t even notice this jumping because 
it happens so fast it doesn’t even have time   to register in your brain. But why can’t we see 
those jumps? Does anyone know a neuroscientist?! So here’s the crazy thing about saccades: 
Your eyes are jumping around about   three times a second, and in between 
that they're making these little micro   saccades, they're making little tiny jitters. But you can't see the whole world streaking by.   Why not? Well it's because when your 
eyes go on this ballistic jump if we   were actually seeing that it would look like 
the world is streaking around all the time So we don't experience that. Instead we 
just experience the world out there. Why? It's a very deep reason actually. 
It's because all you're ever seeing   is your internal model of the outside 
world. You're not seeing the world as it is. Because it actually takes time for your 
eye to move from one place to another.   So what happened to that time? Well it turns out   your brain says okay i'm going to fill 
in the gap with whatever I land on. When your eyes land on the thing 
you've got this gap in time and so your brain 
essentially  retrospectively fills that in. Thanks David Eagleman! Your eyes stop 
on a word for about 200 milliseconds,   then they jump forward 7 to 9 letters.
But somehow your eyes never land in between words. And some types of words: like short words 
or connector words like “the” and “and” Your eyes just skip right over them altogether. Now, how much information we gather each time 
our eyes stop is limited by how our eye is built. The fovea is the area in the center of your vision 
where the photoreceptors are most densely packed,   and where your vision is the sharpest. It 
senses an area about the size of your fingertip   at arm’s length. Around that is 
an area called the parafovea.   The photoreceptors are less dense, and it can 
see some details but things are kinda fuzzy.   And beyond that is basically your peripheral 
vision, where the photoreceptors can basically   just tell that there’s something there, but 
are absolutely terrible at figuring out what. Each time your eyes stop, 
in that split second you’re   gathering information from three different zones. In the center, your fovea clearly 
identifies 3 to 4 letters around   where your eyes stop. This is usually 
enough to recognize that single word. The second zone is in the 
parafovea. It’s much more blurry,   but can get at least a hint at what the 
first few letters of the next word are. And beyond that is an even blurrier zone. No 
letters being identified here, but importantly   you are sensing how long the next word or two is. This gives you enough information to decide 
where your eyes will move next. If the next   word is short and can be skipped, or whether it’s 
long and unfamiliar so you should stop on it. While you are recognizing the word you 
are actually looking at and focusing on,   another part of your eye is already reading 
ahead to tell you what’s coming next.  All in all your eyes only stop on 
about 60% of the words you read. Yet   somehow you still read all of them. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU’RE DOING THIS. So we seem to recognize words not because of their 
shape, but because of the letters they contain.   Which maybe isn’t that surprising,   except we’re seeing most of those 
letters without actually looking at them. We think the way we recognize 
words works something like this:   When your eyes land on or near a word, say SOAP,   you see ALL the letters, that is, you process 
their shapes - basically simultaneously. You don’t scan the letters 
from left to right one by one,   as if your brain is looking 
up a word in a dictionary. You know, the first letter "s" the second 
letter "o" . . . it doesn’t work that way. Your brain simultaneously compares   each letter position with those in 
all the words you’ve seen before. Think of your mental dictionary as a pool 
full of words. Every word with one letter   in common gets a little jolt in your brain’s 
neural networks and floats above the rest.  The words with two letters in common get a 
bigger jolt in your brain and rise above those. Then the words with three letters 
in common get an even bigger jolt. Until finally, the strongest signal in the 
neural network of your brain’s dictionary   rises to the top, and that’s the

networks, all in less than a quarter of a second.   And then you move your eyes, and do it again, 
and again, and again. All thanks to some ancient   evolutionary ability you have to recognize 
certain shapes, curves, and corners.  And the coolest part of all this is

recognize a word, do we see a whole word and just   recognize it by its shape?
Or do we actually read the letters?  You can think of the question this way: When I see 
an elephant, do I see all the individual parts:   it’s big, it’s gray, ears, trunk, 
tusks, and recognize it that way? Or do I just see the whole thing 
and say “that’s an elephant”? To figure that big question 
out, in the 1880s a psychologist   flashed words or letters in front of 
people for just a few milliseconds. And people more accurately recognized 
the whole words than letters all alone. And later experiments in the 1960s flashed either 
real words or nonsense words in front of people   then asked if they recognized 
some particular letter   And people recognized the right letter 
better when it was in a real word. These were a pretty good hint that, to our 
brains, there’s something special about   whole words over just letters. 
The “Word Superiority Effect.” And this is kind of strange when you think 
about how we learn to read. When we’re young   we make words by sounding out the letters or 
combinations of letters in the order they appear. av-o-cah-do That’s the “phonics” in “hooked on phonics” But the word superiority effect 
says that once we learn to read,   we don’t actually process words like that. 
We just… see the word. And we recognize it. Now, at first scientists thought we 
recognized the literal shape of the word. Like if your brain sees this shape it 
analyzes that pattern of ascending and   descending characters, and the 
word “shape” must be inside. And this makes sense! We tend to 
read lowercase faster than all caps,   where the letter shapes aren’t as prominent. And (unless you’re super emo) we are terrible 
at reading AlTeRnAtInG upper and lower case. But that word shape explanation turned 
out to be a little too simple. Because   you can’t spell READING… without the eye. Because . . . eye . . . reading . . . never mind. Now, obviously your eyes move when you 
scan a page. But they’re not scanning   smoothly across lines of text. They jump 
around. Sometimes they even jump backwards. These little movements are 
called saccades. And they’re   really fast. One jump takes 20 to 35 milliseconds. 
Around 10 times faster than the blink of an eye. You don’t even notice this jumping because 
it happens so fast it doesn’t even have time   to register in your brain. But why can’t we see 
those jumps? Does anyone know a neuroscientist?! So here’s the crazy thing about saccades: 
Your eyes are jumping around about   three times a second, and in between 
that they're making these little micro   saccades, they're making little tiny jitters. But you can't see the whole world streaking by.   Why not? Well it's because when your 
eyes go on this ballistic jump if we   were actually seeing that it would look like 
the world is streaking around all the time So we don't experience that. Instead we 
just experience the world out there. Why? It's a very deep reason actually. 
It's because all you're ever seeing   is your internal model of the outside 
world. You're not seeing the world as it is. Because it actually takes time for your 
eye to move from one place to another.   So what happened to that time? Well it turns out   your brain says okay i'm going to fill 
in the gap with whatever I land on. When your eyes land on the thing 
you've got this gap in time and so your brain 
essentially  retrospectively fills that in. Thanks David Eagleman! Your eyes stop 
on a word for about 200 milliseconds,   then they jump forward 7 to 9 letters.
But somehow your eyes never land in between words. And some types of words: like short words 
or connector words like “the” and “and” Your eyes just skip right over them altogether. Now, how much information we gather each time 
our eyes stop is limited by how our eye is built. The fovea is the area in the center of your vision 
where the photoreceptors are most densely packed,   and where your vision is the sharpest. It 
senses an area about the size of your fingertip   at arm’s length. Around that is 
an area called the parafovea.   The photoreceptors are less dense, and it can 
see some details but things are kinda fuzzy.   And beyond that is basically your peripheral 
vision, where the photoreceptors can basically   just tell that there’s something there, but 
are absolutely terrible at figuring out what. Each time your eyes stop, 
in that split second you’re   gathering information from three different zones. In the center, your fovea clearly 
identifies 3 to 4 letters around   where your eyes stop. This is usually 
enough to recognize that single word. The second zone is in the 
parafovea. It’s much more blurry,   but can get at least a hint at what the 
first few letters of the next word are. And beyond that is an even blurrier zone. No 
letters being identified here, but importantly   you are sensing how long the next word or two is. This gives you enough information to decide 
where your eyes will move next. If the next   word is short and can be skipped, or whether it’s 
long and unfamiliar so you should stop on it. While you are recognizing the word you 
are actually looking at and focusing on,   another part of your eye is already reading 
ahead to tell you what’s coming next.  All in all your eyes only stop on 
about 60% of the words you read. Yet   somehow you still read all of them. AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA YOU’RE DOING THIS. So we seem to recognize words not because of their 
shape, but because of the letters they contain.   Which maybe isn’t that surprising,   except we’re seeing most of those 
letters without actually looking at them. We think the way we recognize 
words works something like this:   When your eyes land on or near a word, say SOAP,   you see ALL the letters, that is, you process 
their shapes - basically simultaneously. You don’t scan the letters 
from left to right one by one,   as if your brain is looking 
up a word in a dictionary. You know, the first letter "s" the second 
letter "o" . . . it doesn’t work that way. Your brain simultaneously compares   each letter position with those in 
all the words you’ve seen before. Think of your mental dictionary as a pool 
full of words. Every word with one letter   in common gets a little jolt in your brain’s 
neural networks and floats above the rest.  The words with two letters in common get a 
bigger jolt in your brain and rise above those. Then the words with three letters 
in common get an even bigger jolt. Until finally, the strongest signal in the 
neural network of your brain’s dictionary   rises to the top, and that’s the 
winner: The word you recognize. This happens over and over as your eyes 
jump from spot to spot across the page,   taking in different kinds of information from 
various parts of your eye, unconsciously reading   ahead in your brain, activating countless neural 
networks, all in less than a quarter of a second.   And then you move your eyes, and do it again, 
and again, and again. All thanks to some ancient   evolutionary ability you have to recognize 
certain shapes, curves, and corners.  And the coolest part of all this is 
the next time you pick up a book,   you won’t even think about 
any of this. You’ll just   enjoy a good story. As long as the I’s

**Transcript**:
Throughout the 1800s,
in saloons across the West, you could find cowboys
locked in tense standoffs. But these weren’t shootouts. They were simply playing cards— for a mountain of chips
worth their weight in gold. Most men wore loaded pistols
in case a player was caught cheating. When they prepared to make
their bets, however, these cowboys weren’t focused
on their holsters or their cards, but rather on their opponent’s face. Because not even a bullet could protect
them from a well-executed bluff. From its earliest incarnations,
poker has always been a battle of nerves. The game first emerged around 1800
in the melting pot of New Orleans. At this time, two games
ruled the card tables: French poque played with a 20-card deck,
and English Brag which used 52-cards. Both these games saw players being dealt
five cards from a four-suit deck, and then trying to make the best hand
possible according to a simple hierarchy. They would then wager on whether
or not they had the best hand— either adding more money to the pot or folding and forfeiting
their chance to win it. But since each player's cards were only
revealed at the end of the hand, someone with bad cards could always bluff— betting enough to scare
his opponents into folding. Both games had slightly different hand
combinations, but most importantly, Brag allowed players to discard
and draw new cards, making better hands more likely and
allowing for another round of betting. Eventually, the Southerners merged
the two games into a new version of poque—
which they pronounced pokuh— that created bigger pots and
opportunities for more complex bluffing. This winning combination of guile, guts,
and gambling caught on quickly. But its popularity skyrocketed
after the invention of the steamboat, which carried livestock, goods,
and card games up the Mississippi, Ohio,
and Missouri rivers. By Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860, Americans in every state and territory
were playing the newfangled bluffing game. And while many played
for low, friendly stakes, some gamblers put their homes
and livelihoods on the line. These life-changing bets even found
their way into popular novels like “Gone with the Wind,” where Scarlett O’Hara’s father wins
an entire plantation in a single hand of poker. But as pots became bigger, 
so did the temptation to cheat. Some players enlisted an accomplice
to spy on opponents and used props to communicate their hands. Others marked important cards with nicks,
dents, or invisible ink. But perhaps the most common method was
sneaking a cold deck into the game. Cold decks were pre-sequenced
to give victims powerful hands that encouraged them to bet big, while giving the cheater
an even better one. However, even cheaters had to keep
up with the game’s constant changes. As poker moved west with the Gold Rush,
new variants emerged. Five-card Stud became the game of choice among notorious gunmen like Doc Holliday,
Wyatt Earp, and Wild Bill Hickok. With four rounds of betting, Five-card Stud produced
even more lucrative pots, encouraging so much cheating that
California outlawed the game in 1885. Meanwhile, back in Texas,
another variant emerged to solve the common problem of having
too many players and not enough cards. This game, known as Texas Hold'em, became a favorite because its low ratio
of private, hidden cards to shared, exposed cards allowed for plenty of deductions
and tactical maneuvering. Even more exciting was no-limit Hold’em,
which allowed players to go all in, betting everything they had
at any point in the hand. In 1928, Hungarian polymath
John von Neumann sought to explain the nuances of betting
and bluffing in mathematical terms. His work became the foundation
for a whole new branch of mathematics called game theory, which has grown to be vitally important
not only in high-stakes poker, but in economics and military strategy. In the late 20th century,
game theory became essential for navigating the geopolitical bluffing
game of nuclear warfare. Today, America’s card game
is an international affair, attracting players
from over a hundred countries to the annual World Series of Poker. Fortunes are made and lost every
day on casino floors, poker websites, and in thousands of live
and online tournaments. So while a single game's outcome
will never be certain, poker is definitely here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Throughout the 1800s,
in saloons across the West, you could find cowboys
locked in tense standoffs. But these weren’t shootouts. They were simply playing cards— for a mountain of chips
worth their weight in gold. Most men wore loaded pistols
in case a player was caught cheating. When they prepared to make
their bets, however, these cowboys weren’t focused
on their holsters or their cards, but rather on their opponent’s face. Because not even a bullet could protect
them from a well-executed bluff. From its earliest incarnations,
poker has always been a battle of nerves. The game first emerged around 1800
in the melting pot of New Orleans. At this time, two games
ruled the card tables: French poque played with a 20-card deck,
and English Brag which used 52-cards. Both these games saw players being dealt
five cards from a four-suit deck, and then trying to make the best hand
possible according to a simple hierarchy. They would then wager on whether
or not they had the best hand— either adding more money to the pot or folding and forfeiting
their chance to win it. But since each player's cards were only
revealed at the end of the hand, someone with bad cards could always bluff— betting enough to scare
his opponents into folding. Both games had slightly different hand
combinations, but most importantly, Brag allowed players to discard
and draw new cards, making better hands more likely and
allowing for another round of betting. Eventually, the Southerners merged
the two games into a new version of poque—
which they pronounced pokuh— that created bigger pots and
opportunities for more complex bluffing. This winning combination of guile, guts,
and gambling caught on quickly. But its popularity skyrocketed
after the invention of the steamboat, which carried livestock, goods,
and card games up the Mississippi, Ohio,
and Missouri rivers. By Abraham Lincoln’s election in 1860, Americans in every state and territory
were playing the newfangled bluffing game. And while many played
for low, friendly stakes, some gamblers put their homes
and livelihoods on the line. These life-changing bets even found
their way into popular novels like “Gone with the Wind,” where Scarlett O’Hara’s father wins
an entire plantation in a single hand of poker. But as pots became bigger, 
so did the temptation to cheat. Some players enlisted an accomplice
to spy on opponents and used props to communicate their hands. Others marked important cards with nicks,
dents, or invisible ink. But perhaps the most common method was
sneaking a cold deck into the game. Cold decks were pre-sequenced
to give victims powerful hands that encouraged them to bet big, while giving the cheater
an even better one. However, even cheaters had to keep
up with the game’s constant changes. As poker moved west with the Gold Rush,
new variants emerged. Five-card Stud became the game of choice among notorious gunmen like Doc Holliday,
Wyatt Earp, and Wild Bill Hickok. With four rounds of betting, Five-card Stud produced
even more lucrative pots, encouraging so much cheating that
California outlawed the game in 1885. Meanwhile, back in Texas,
another variant emerged to solve the common problem of having
too many players and not enough cards. This game, known as Texas Hold'em, became a favorite because its low ratio
of private, hidden cards to shared, exposed cards allowed for plenty of deductions
and tactical maneuvering. Even more exciting was no-limit Hold’em,
which allowed players to go all in, betting everything they had
at any point in the hand. In 1928, Hungarian polymath
John von Neumann sought to explain the nuances of betting
and bluffing in mathematical terms. His work became the foundation
for a whole new branch of mathematics called game theory, which has grown to be vitally important
not only in high-stakes poker, but in economics and military strategy. In the late 20th century,
game theory became essential for navigating the geopolitical bluffing
game of nuclear warfare. Today, America’s card game
is an international affair, attracting players
from over a hundred countries to the annual World Series of Poker. Fortunes are made and lost every
day on casino floors, poker websites, and in thousands of live
and online tournaments. So while a single game's outcome
will never be certain, poker is definitely here to stay.

**Transcript**:
Isn’t it odd that, when something’s funny, you might show your teeth,
change your breathing, become weak and achy in some places,
and maybe even cry? In other words, why do we do
this bizarre thing that is laughter? When you laugh, your abdominal muscles
contract rapidly. This alters your breathing patterns, increasing the pressure in your
chest cavity, and pushing air out, which might audibly emerge as a snort,
wheeze, or vocalization. Because you’re exerting your abdominal
muscles much more than you usually would while talking, they may start to hurt. Laughter also inhibits your reflexes
and muscle control, causing sensations like leg weakness. So, where does this funny phenomenon
come from? Because there’s no archaeological
record of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why
it evolved, but scientists have some theories. Importantly, humans are not
the only animals today that do something like laughter. Using ultrasonic recorders, researchers in the late 90s realized
that rats were basically giggling while being tickled. Scientists have since compiled evidence
of at least 65 species— mostly mammals, but also some birds—
that vocalize during social play. Some, unsurprisingly,
are our closest relatives. By recording and analyzing the sounds
primates make while playing and being tickled, researchers grew more convinced that
the ancient ancestor of all great apes did something like laughter. And, because other apes make laughter-like
sounds during rough-and-tumble play, they think laughter may have originally
developed to clearly signal friendly, non-aggressive intent. But of course, humans don’t just laugh
when we’re wrestling, but also when we’re amused,
and even surprised, confused, or nervous. Some scientists think laughter took
on expanded functions after humans split from other great apes and developed large social groups
and more complex language abilities. They hypothesize that laughter gradually
became something we could use not just during play but within speech
to convey subtle meanings and a range of contexts
to show our emotions. This is thought to be one of the reasons
that laughter is contagious: it’s like an invitation to share
in someone’s emotional state. Just hearing clips of laughter can
activate key regions in your brain, triggering you to smile or laugh yourself. And, when participants in one study
watched a funny video, they laughed significantly longer
and more often when another person was present— even though they reported feeling
the same level of amusement. Human laughter is also generally louder than the play vocalizations
of most animals. Some scientists speculate that this
is because our laughter functions not only as a signal between individuals,
but a broadcast to everyone around. Studies found that observers across the
world and as young as 5 months old could reliably tell the difference
between close friends and acquaintances just from brief clips of them laughing. Similarly, we can tell whether a laugh
is real or fake based just on the sound. Fake, or volitional, laughter is produced in entirely different networks
in the brain, relying on speech-like pathways. Meanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises
from older networks that other animals also use
for their vocalizations. And laughter is not just
socially important; it’s also thought to be good for us. When we laugh, our brains release
feel-good neurotransmitters like endorphins, and decrease levels of stress hormones
like cortisol. Some research even suggests that people
who laugh more can cope with stress more effectively
and have better cardiovascular health. Laughter is a universal human behavior. Babies can laugh before they can speak. Whether it's the best medicine
depends on your ailment. But as something that makes
life more tolerable, strengthens bonds, and potentially
improves aspects of your health, you can’t go wrong with a good laugh. Unless you have a broken rib or something. Then it’s no laughing matter. Certainly nothing to crack up about.

contract rapidly. This alters your breathing patterns, increasing the pressure in your
chest cavity, and pushing air out, which might audibly emerge as a snort,
wheeze, or vocalization. Because you’re exerting your abdominal
muscles much more than you usually would while talking, they may start to hurt. Laughter also inhibits your reflexes
and muscle control, causing sensations like leg weakness. So, where does this funny phenomenon
come from? Because there’s no archaeological
record of laughter, it’s impossible to say exactly how and why
it evolved, but scientists have some theories. Importantly, humans are not
the only animals today that do something like laughter. Using ultrasonic recorders, researchers in the late 90s realized
that rats were basically giggling while being tickled. Scientists have since compiled evidence
of at least 65 species— mostly mammals, but also some birds—
that vocalize during social play. Some, unsurprisingly,
are our closest relatives. By recording and analyzing the sounds
primates make while playing and being tickled, researchers grew more convinced that
the ancient ancestor of all great apes did something like laughter. And, because other apes make laughter-like
sounds during rough-and-tumble play, they think laughter may have originally
developed to clearly signal friendly, non-aggressive intent. But of course, humans don’t just laugh
when we’re wrestling, but also when we’re amused,
and even surprised, confused, or nervous. Some scientists think laughter took
on expanded functions after humans split from other great apes and developed large social groups
and more complex language abilities. They hypothesize that laughter gradually
became something we could use not just during play but within speech
to convey subtle meanings and a range of contexts
to show our emotions. This is thought to be one of the reasons
that laughter is contagious: it’s like an invitation to share
in someone’s emotional state. Just hearing clips of laughter can
activate key regions in your brain, triggering you to smile or laugh yourself. And, when participants in one study
watched a funny video, they laughed significantly longer
and more often when another person was present— even though they reported feeling
the same level of amusement. Human laughter is also generally louder than the play vocalizations
of most animals. Some scientists speculate that this
is because our laughter functions not only as a signal between individuals,
but a broadcast to everyone around. Studies found that observers across the
world and as young as 5 months old could reliably tell the difference
between close friends and acquaintances just from brief clips of them laughing. Similarly, we can tell whether a laugh
is real or fake based just on the sound. Fake, or volitional, laughter is produced in entirely different networks
in the brain, relying on speech-like pathways. Meanwhile, spontaneous laughter arises
from older networks that other animals also use
for their vocalizations. And laughter is not just
socially important; it’s also thought to be good for us. When we laugh, our brains release
feel-good neurotransmitters like endorphins, and decrease levels of stress hormones
like cortisol. Some research even suggests that people
who laugh more can cope with stress more effectively
and have better cardiovascular health. Laughter is a universal human behavior. Babies can laugh before they can speak. Whether it's the best medicine
depends on your ailment. But as something that makes
life more tolerable, strengthens bonds, and potentially
improves aspects of your health, you can’t go wrong with a good laugh. Unless you have a broken rib or something. Then it’s no laughing matter. Certainly nothing to crack up about.

**Transcript**:
In the fight to curb climate change, there are few solutions more discussed
than planting lots and lots of trees. It sounds simple enough— trees absorb
CO2 from the atmosphere to grow, so planting more of them should help
eliminate greenhouse gases. The trouble is, tree planting efforts
don't always work as planned. For example, between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped
fund the planting of over a million hectares of new trees. Yet a recent analysis suggests
this multi-million dollar effort resulted in no major carbon storage gains. What went wrong? Chile focused on afforestation: the planting of trees in places long
devoid of— or never home to— any forest, as opposed to reforestation, the practice of restoring recently
degraded forests. Many governments and international
organizations champion afforestation in their efforts to meet
lofty tree planting goals that require massive amounts of land. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011
by the German government and the International Union
for Conservation of Nature, aims to restore 350 million hectares
of degraded land across the globe by 2030, in part through afforestation. Many companies have also seized
on tree planting to offset emissions and, in some cases, negative PR from their
contributions to the climate emergency. A 2021 Oxfam analysis found that the area
needed to match the tree planting goals set by four of the largest
oil and gas producers would require land twice the size
of the UK. Here's where things get complicated. In order to be a long-term carbon sink, trees need to grow to maturity
and stay put. Most of Chile's afforestation funding went
to the commercial forestry industry, which drastically expanded plantations
of mostly non-native trees— in some cases even by plowing
into native forests. According to one study, on average, natural forests are 40 times better
at carbon storage than plantations. A mature tree can absorb up to
22 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. But plantation trees are harvested. Further, pine and eucalyptus—
two commonly grown plantation trees— are highly flammable, so gains in carbon storage
can quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,
of the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative
in Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas
threatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,
not to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years
of tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation
tucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected
from fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have
unintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb
more of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t
plant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which
species to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting
native trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more
efficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests
and let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow
from old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds
deliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice
assisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses
that compete with saplings, preventing grazing,
and even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees
in the wrong places. It’s bad when it’s mistakenly used
as a catch-all solution, rather than addressing more
complex issues like carbon emissions and active deforestation. It’s also bad to plant trees when it
allows companies and governments to practice greenwashing, throwing money at initiatives that
have no real chance of achieving the carbon offsets they promise. The best investments in a greener future
are to cut carbon emissions, while protecting these forests from being
destroyed in the first place.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was the main issue with Chile's tree planting efforts between 1974 and 2012?

**Transcript**:
In the fight to curb climate change, there are few solutions more discussed
than planting lots and lots of trees. It sounds simple enough— trees absorb
CO2 from the atmosphere to grow, so planting more of them should help
eliminate greenhouse gases. The trouble is, tree planting efforts
don't always work as planned. For example, between 1974 and 2012, the Chilean government helped
fund the planting of over a million hectares of new trees. Yet a recent analysis suggests
this multi-million dollar effort resulted in no major carbon storage gains. What went wrong? Chile focused on afforestation: the planting of trees in places long
devoid of— or never home to— any forest, as opposed to reforestation, the practice of restoring recently
degraded forests. Many governments and international
organizations champion afforestation in their efforts to meet
lofty tree planting goals that require massive amounts of land. The Bonn Challenge, launched in 2011
by the German government and the International Union
for Conservation of Nature, aims to restore 350 million hectares
of degraded land across the globe by 2030, in part through afforestation. Many companies have also seized
on tree planting to offset emissions and, in some cases, negative PR from their
contributions to the climate emergency. A 2021 Oxfam analysis found that the area
needed to match the tree planting goals set by four of the largest
oil and gas producers would require land twice the size
of the UK. Here's where things get complicated. In order to be a long-term carbon sink, trees need to grow to maturity
and stay put. Most of Chile's afforestation funding went
to the commercial forestry industry, which drastically expanded plantations
of mostly non-native trees— in some cases even by plowing
into native forests. According to one study, on average, natural forests are 40 times better
at carbon storage than plantations. A mature tree can absorb up to
22 kilograms of carbon dioxide each year. But plantation trees are harvested. Further, pine and eucalyptus—
two commonly grown plantation trees— are highly flammable, so gains in carbon storage
can quickly go up in smoke. And not all land should be forested. In 2019, researchers estimated that,
of the 100 million hectares of land targeted for a tree planting initiative
in Africa, most is savanna. Dropping trees into Africa’s savannas
threatens wildlife that thrive in sunlight and open spaces. And wildfires,
not to mention a passing elephant, can quickly stomp out years
of tree growth. Meanwhile, a savanna’s natural vegetation
tucks most of its carbon safely away below ground, where it’s protected
from fire and hungry herbivores. Planting trees can also have
unintended consequences in places that naturally reflect sunlight like drylands or snowy terrain. Trees in these regions could absorb
more of the Sun’s rays, contributing to a warmer planet. It’s not that we shouldn’t
plant more trees. But for the best chance of success, programs should consider which
species to plant, which lands to forest, and how to protect the land long-term. Today, Chile is prioritizing planting
native trees rather than timber plantations. Some researchers argue that a more
efficient way to re-green the planet is to protect forests
and let nature do the work. On recently deforested land, seeds wait in soil and new sprouts grow
from old stumps. As time passes, birds and winds
deliver seeds from forests nearby. Others support programs that practice
assisted natural regeneration— helping nature along by removing grasses
that compete with saplings, preventing grazing,
and even planting trees in small patches. So when is it bad to plant trees? When programs put the wrong trees
in the wrong places. It’s bad when it’s mistakenly used
as a catch-all solution, rather than addressing more
complex issues like carbon emissions and active deforestation. It’s also bad to plant trees when it
allows companies and governments to practice greenwashing, throwing money at initiatives that
have no real chance of achieving the carbon offsets they promise. The best investments in a greener future
are to cut carbon emissions, while protecting these forests from being
destroyed in the first place.

**Transcript**:
Navigating an icy road can be pretty dangerous. And while applying a coating of 
salt is the time-tested method for rendering a frozen highway 
drivable, that salt has major downsides. It’s toxic for plants, wildlife 
and freshwater ecosystems. It contaminates our drinking 
water and air quality. It can even damage our cars, which, 
like, feels a bit counter-productive. So, how do we make winter roads safe 
for both drivers and the environment? Well, science says we have options. [♪ INTRO] Salting a road is by far the 
most common de-icing technique. When salt mixes with water, the resulting solution has a lower freezing temperature 
than water by itself. However, this is true for all kinds 
of solutions, not just salty ones. Thanks to a scientific principle 
called freezing point depression, the temperature at which 
plain H2O freezes is always higher than its freezing point when 
something is dissolved into it. Essentially, the salt keeps water 
molecules from forming solid ice crystals because the salt interrupts 
the watery ice structure. The temperature at which the 
salty water eventually freezes depends on how salty the solution is. And although salting roads with the 
classic sodium chloride is effective, it wreaks havoc on plants and wildlife, 
contributes to poor air, soil and water quality, ruins infrastructure like water 
treatment plants and bridges, and corrodes our stuff (like the steel in cars). Which is why some places are experimenting with a few solutions to this chilly conundrum. We can start simple: even a different 
kind of salt can make a difference! The sodium chloride you put on your food 
is chemically the same as the rock salt, or halite, that's spread on roads to melt ice. It's cheap, effective, and the infrastructure for delivering it to roads is already in place. The problem is that the 
chlorides in the sodium chloride don't ever break down in the environment. But other salts are better for the environment, if only because less is required 
in solution to achieve the same freezing point depression we get with a 
higher concentration of sodium chloride. Remember, a salt is just any compound 
that has positive and negative ions, which together make a neutral charge. There are a lot of options 
for what salts you can use. For instance, magnesium 
chloride and calcium chloride lower the freezing point more effectively 
due to some interesting chemistry. When sodium chloride dissolves in water, 
it dissociates into two ions: Na+ and Cl-. Magnesium chloride and calcium 
chloride, on the other hand, dissociate into three ions 
each, since they’re each made of three total atoms instead of the two in NaCl. And because the number of 
dissolved particles in a solution is what determines how low the 
freezing point of a solution can get, salts like calcium chloride can do 
the same job as sodium chloride, while using less raw salt to do it. Some states like Connecticut have used 
magnesium chloride salts for de-icing, citing the lower cost of the solution. However, there is a downside: they’re 
still somewhat corrosive to cars, making them less than ideal. And these salts are also bad for the 
environment when they accumulate; it just doesn't happen as 
fast as with sodium chloride, because less is needed to do the job. Figuring out which ions react with 
what can be a major chemistry puzzle. And you can find more of those at 
Brilliant, the online learning platform with thousands of lessons in 
science, computer science, and math, and the sponsor for this video. Their Chemistry and Biology Puzzles 
course takes interactive learning to the next level with 28 quick lessons 
full of puzzles that keep you engaged. Some of those puzzles cover the 
basics of chemical reactions that can help you follow along with all of the 
ions I just rattled off, while others pose environmental questions for things 
like finding a cleaner burning fuel. You can try them all for free for 
30 days at Brilliant.org/SciShow or by clicking the link in 
the description down below. That link also gives you 20% off an 
annual premium Brilliant subscription. So, if your ears perked up at the 
mere mention of the environment, just wait until you hear about 
this next de-icing alternative. Of course, there are other options 
beyond salts for de-icing roads. Some state road agencies have 
tested all kinds of weird stuff: cheese brine, pickle juice, beet 
juice and pig pee, to name a few. Welcome to the wild world of potentially 
eco-friendly methods for melting road ice! Byproducts from vodka distilleries or 
sugar beet processing facilities contain a lot of sugars, which, when added to 
road salts, helps lower the melting point of the ice, meaning the salt will work 
better at even lower temperatures. But not all eco-options are created equal. For instance, some communities have 
complained about the smell from that beet wastewater, and some research 
shows that distillery byproducts can also cause some of those ecosystem 
problems that we’re trying to avoid. Urea is also marketed as an eco-friendly 
solution to road salt, since it’s also water-soluble and makes a solution with 
a lower freezing point than pure water. And while urea is great at 
de-icing and is generally safe for pets and children to be around, 
there are some downsides. It doesn't perform well below - 4 degrees 
celsius and once it gets into a waterway, it decreases dissolved oxygen 
and causes algal blooms. ~ Plus, urea is actually somewhat expensive, at least compared to the other options out there. Still, there’s definitely a market for more 
of these less harmful options for de-icing. The other way to help de-ice our roads 
is also the way to make pickles - brine. But I’m not talking about 
your leftover pickle juice! Brine is just water that’s got a lot of 
salts dissolved in it, and using brine on the roads is a pretty neat way to prevent 
the ice from forming in the first place. When you de-ice a road that's already 
been snowed upon, transportation agencies use wet rock salt to break the bond between the ice and the road, making it safer to drive. But the idea behind the brine is to apply 
liquid salt to the road ahead of time. Some places have started brining the roads with liquid salt solution before 
the snow or ice shows up. This limits the amount of ice that 
can form on the road to begin with, and uses about a quarter of the salt of de-icing. Brining requires a lot of infrastructure 
and planning; a community needs trucks with big tanks and pumps to spray 
the brine onto the pavement surface. This stuff can be expensive. However, communities that have 
invested in brining roads have reported reducing the overall cost of maintaining 
winter roads, even after accounting for the extra equipment and staffing. And the reason for the savings is simple: 
they're just not buying as much salt! So, while nothing is perfect, there are 
absolutely some ways we can move ahead on making our roads safer and more eco-friendly. Let’s just hope they don’t all smell like pig pee. Thanks for watching! [♪ OUTRO]

beyond salts for de-icing roads. Some state road agencies have 
tested all kinds of weird stuff: cheese brine, pickle juice, beet 
juice and pig pee, to name a few. Welcome to the wild world of potentially 
eco-friendly methods for melting road ice! Byproducts from vodka distilleries or 
sugar beet processing facilities contain a lot of sugars, which, when added to 
road salts, helps lower the melting point of the ice, meaning the salt will work 
better at even lower temperatures. But not all eco-options are created equal. For instance, some communities have 
complained about the smell from that beet wastewater, and some research 
shows that distillery byproducts can also cause some of those ecosystem 
problems that we’re trying to avoid. Urea is also marketed as an eco-friendly 
solution to road salt, since it’s also water-soluble and makes a solution with 
a lower freezing point than pure water. And while urea is great at 
de-icing and is generally safe for pets and children to be around, 
there are some downsides. It doesn't perform well below - 4 degrees 
celsius and once it gets into a waterway, it decreases dissolved oxygen 
and causes algal blooms. ~ Plus, urea is actually somewhat expensive, at least compared to the other options out there. Still, there’s definitely a market for more 
of these less harmful options for de-icing. The other way to help de-ice our roads 
is also the way to make pickles - brine. But I’m not talking about 
your leftover pickle juice! Brine is just water that’s got a lot of 
salts dissolved in it, and using brine on the roads is a pretty neat way to prevent 
the ice from forming in the first place. When you de-ice a road that's already 
been snowed upon, transportation agencies use wet rock salt to break the bond between the ice and the road, making it safer to drive. But the idea behind the brine is to apply 
liquid salt to the road ahead of time. Some places have started brining the roads with liquid salt solution before 
the snow or ice shows up. This limits the amount of ice that 
can form on the road to begin with, and uses about a quarter of the salt of de-icing. Brining requires a lot of infrastructure 
and planning; a community needs trucks with big tanks and pumps to spray 
the brine onto the pavement surface. This stuff can be expensive. However, communities that have 
invested in brining roads have reported reducing the overall cost of maintaining 
winter roads, even after accounting for the extra equipment and staffing. And the reason for the savings is simple: 
they're just not buying as much salt! So, while nothing is perfect, there are 
absolutely some ways we can move ahead on making our roads safer and more eco-friendly. Let’s just hope they don’t all smell like pig pee. Thanks for watching! [♪ OUTRO]

**Transcript**:
Navigating an icy road can be pretty dangerous. And while applying a coating of 
salt is the time-tested method for rendering a frozen highway 
drivable, that salt has major downsides. It’s toxic for plants, wildlife 
and freshwater ecosystems. It contaminates our drinking 
water and air quality. It can even damage our cars, which, 
like, feels a bit counter-productive. So, how do we make winter roads safe 
for both drivers and the environment? Well, science says we have options. [♪ INTRO] Salting a road is by far the 
most common de-icing technique. When salt mixes with water, the resulting solution has a lower freezing temperature 
than water by itself. However, this is true for all kinds 
of solutions, not just salty ones. Thanks to a scientific principle 
called freezing point depression, the temperature at which 
plain H2O freezes is always higher than its freezing point when 
something is dissolved into it. Essentially, the salt keeps water 
molecules from forming solid ice crystals because the salt interrupts 
the watery ice structure. The temperature at which the 
salty water eventually freezes depends on how salty the solution is. And although salting roads with the 
classic sodium chloride is effective, it wreaks havoc on plants and wildlife, 
contributes to poor air, soil and water quality, ruins infrastructure like water 
treatment plants and bridges, and corrodes our stuff (like the steel in cars). Which is why some places are experimenting with a few solutions to this chilly conundrum. We can start simple: even a different 
kind of salt can make a difference! The sodium chloride you put on your food 
is chemically the same as the rock salt, or halite, that's spread on roads to melt ice. It's cheap, effective, and the infrastructure for delivering it to roads is already in place. The problem is that the 
chlorides in the sodium chloride don't ever break down in the environment. But other salts are better for the environment, if only because less is required 
in solution to achieve the same freezing point depression we get with a 
higher concentration of sodium chloride. Remember, a salt is just any compound 
that has positive and negative ions, which together make a neutral charge. There are a lot of options 
for what salts you can use. For instance, magnesium 
chloride and calcium chloride lower the freezing point more effectively 
due to some interesting chemistry. When sodium chloride dissolves in water, 
it dissociates into two ions: Na+ and Cl-. Magnesium chloride and calcium 
chloride, on the other hand, dissociate into three ions 
each, since they’re each made of three total atoms instead of the two in NaCl. And because the number of 
dissolved particles in a solution is what determines how low the 
freezing point of a solution can get, salts like calcium chloride can do 
the same job as sodium chloride, while using less raw salt to do it. Some states like Connecticut have used 
magnesium chloride salts for de-icing, citing the lower cost of the solution. However, there is a downside: they’re 
still somewhat corrosive to cars, making them less than ideal. And these salts are also bad for the 
environment when they accumulate; it just doesn't happen as 
fast as with sodium chloride, because less is needed to do the job. Figuring out which ions react with 
what can be a major chemistry puzzle. And you can find more of those at

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1800s, soon after American whaling ships
began operating in the North Pacific, an interesting trend emerged. Whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful
strikes within just a few years. Sperm whales in the region had
suddenly become much harder to kill. Generally, when predators
like orcas are nearby, sperm whales protect their most vulnerable by forming defensive circles
at the surface. But this behavior made them
susceptible to whaling ships. It seems that sperm whales
in the North Pacific were somehow able to quickly
adapt to this reality. Groups that likely hadn’t yet experienced
human attacks began escaping whaling boats
on fast currents instead of forming defensive circles. And, based on what we’re starting
to understand about sperm whales, it seems possible they were actually
broadcasting survival strategies to one another. Indeed, unbeknownst to whalers, spermaceti, the material they killed for, is an essential part of the sperm whale’s
sophisticated communication and echolocation system. This waxy substance fills a cavity
in the sperm whale’s head. And their head is mostly comprised
of an expanded nose that serves as a highly calibrated
sonar system. Sperm whales generate some of the loudest
biological noises on record, communicate copiously using
an array of complex vocalization styles, and have the largest brains on Earth. They spend most of their time searching
the ocean's depths for prey. They can stay submerged for over an hour,
and dive deeper than 1,200 meters, far beyond sunlight’s reach,
where they’re guided by sound. The loudest noise recorded underwater
is around 270 decibels. Sperm whale-generated sounds
can reach 230. And they frequently fix
their high-intensity echolocation clicks on squid. Some of the air they inhale through their
blowhole is routed into their lungs, while the rest enters a complex,
sound-producing system. There, air is funneled through lip-like
appendages at the front of their heads. This generates a sound that travels
backwards through their spermaceti organ, bounces off an air sac,
then traverses another waxy organ, which amplifies and directs the sound. The click exits the sperm whale’s head
a powerful, focused beam. It’s suspected that
the returning vibrations are received by the whale’s lower jaw
and directed into the ears. Then, their brain’s expanded
auditory processing region analyzes the quality of the echoes
to map their surroundings in the darkness. With this mechanism, sperm whales
can locate squid 300 meters away. Scientists think squid don’t hear
these high-frequency clicks— even as they turn into rapid buzzes
and creaks as the whale closes in. Sperm whales can eat more than a ton
of squid every day. Their stomachs and feces are usually
full of indigestible squid beaks, and their skin often scarred
by squid tentacles. When they're not hunting, however, sperm whales use an entirely
different vocal repertoire. Mature males make clang noises, which scientists suspect play a role
in mating. And most other sperm whales live
in social family groups. Though their communication might get
interrupted when predators are near or human-generated noises dominate, they generally chatter at length
at the water’s surface. Sperm whales do this using patterned click
sequences akin to Morse code, called codas, which are thought to function
as social identity markers. Researchers have identified dozens
of distinct types of codas, according to patterns in the numbers
of clicks used and their rhythm and tempo. Some codas are more ubiquitous, while others vary greatly according
to family groups and individuals. All families in a given region that consistently use some of the same
characteristic coda patterns share a dialect
and belong to the same vocal clan. Each sperm whale calf goes
through a multi-year period of babbling, where they experiment
with different sounds before becoming fluent
in their clan’s coda dialect. How and what exactly sperm whales
communicate to each other is currently unknown, but there are indications that the
information can be sophisticated. Biologists, roboticists, linguists,
cryptographers, and artificial intelligence experts are collaborating to monitor and analyze
sperm whale vocalizations. The aim is to finally decipher
what they're saying.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Sperm whales can generate sounds that can reach up to ____ decibels as measured underwater.
Options: A. 180, B. 200 , C. 230 , D. 270

Question: What is the suspected purpose of the spermaceti organ in a sperm whale's head?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the mid-1800s, soon after American whaling ships
began operating in the North Pacific, an interesting trend emerged. Whalers saw a 58% drop in their successful
strikes within just a few years. Sperm whales in the region had
suddenly become much harder to kill. Generally, when predators
like orcas are nearby, sperm whales protect their most vulnerable by forming defensive circles
at the surface. But this behavior made them
susceptible to whaling ships. It seems that sperm whales
in the North Pacific were somehow able to quickly
adapt to this reality. Groups that likely hadn’t yet experienced
human attacks began escaping whaling boats
on fast currents instead of forming defensive circles. And, based on what we’re starting
to understand about sperm whales, it seems possible they were actually
broadcasting survival strategies to one another. Indeed, unbeknownst to whalers, spermaceti, the material they killed for, is an essential part of the sperm whale’s
sophisticated communication and echolocation system. This waxy substance fills a cavity
in the sperm whale’s head. And their head is mostly comprised
of an expanded nose that serves as a highly calibrated
sonar system. Sperm whales generate some of the loudest
biological noises on record, communicate copiously using
an array of complex vocalization styles, and have the largest brains on Earth. They spend most of their time searching
the ocean's depths for prey. They can stay submerged for over an hour,
and dive deeper than 1,200 meters, far beyond sunlight’s reach,
where they’re guided by sound. The loudest noise recorded underwater
is around 270 decibels. Sperm whale-generated sounds
can reach 230. And they frequently fix
their high-intensity echolocation clicks on squid. Some of the air they inhale through their
blowhole is routed into their lungs, while the rest enters a complex,
sound-producing system. There, air is funneled through lip-like
appendages at the front of their heads. This generates a sound that travels
backwards through their spermaceti organ, bounces off an air sac,
then traverses another waxy organ, which amplifies and directs the sound. The click exits the sperm whale’s head
a powerful, focused beam. It’s suspected that
the returning vibrations are received by the whale’s lower jaw
and directed into the ears. Then, their brain’s expanded
auditory processing region analyzes the quality of the echoes
to map their surroundings in the darkness. With this mechanism, sperm whales
can locate squid 300 meters away. Scientists think squid don’t hear
these high-frequency clicks— even as they turn into rapid buzzes
and creaks as the whale closes in. Sperm whales can eat more than a ton
of squid every day. Their stomachs and feces are usually
full of indigestible squid beaks, and their skin often scarred
by squid tentacles. When they're not hunting, however, sperm whales use an entirely
different vocal repertoire. Mature males make clang noises, which scientists suspect play a role
in mating. And most other sperm whales live
in social family groups. Though their communication might get
interrupted when predators are near or human-generated noises dominate, they generally chatter at length
at the water’s surface. Sperm whales do this using patterned click
sequences akin to Morse code, called codas, which are thought to function
as social identity markers. Researchers have identified dozens
of distinct types of codas, according to patterns in the numbers
of clicks used and their rhythm and tempo. Some codas are more ubiquitous, while others vary greatly according
to family groups and individuals. All families in a given region that consistently use some of the same
characteristic coda patterns share a dialect
and belong to the same vocal clan. Each sperm whale calf goes
through a multi-year period of babbling, where they experiment
with different sounds before becoming fluent
in their clan’s coda dialect. How and what exactly sperm whales
communicate to each other is currently unknown, but there are indications that the
information can be sophisticated. Biologists, roboticists, linguists,
cryptographers, and artificial intelligence experts are collaborating to monitor and analyze
sperm whale vocalizations. The aim is to finally decipher
what they're saying.
