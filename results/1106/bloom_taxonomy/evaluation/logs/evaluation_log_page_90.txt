Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison
to lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It's just one of the many thousands
of tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles
covers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for 
the heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly 
is the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches
via tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only
found in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines
the blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are 
made up of muscle cells, also known as fibers,
bundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from
the nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn
generates force and motion. This produces almost all
the movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed 
by the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split
into three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers
and lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten
while the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it 
bend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship 
is reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership
exists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction
creates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers
don't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee
or lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture
by holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk
of the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us,
like the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so,
like the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek
to your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment
called the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are
connected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control
over their movements. This muscle group also contains
two types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further,
slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly
when triggered but quickly use up their energy
and tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,
are endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly
so they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more
fast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly,
pick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain 
more slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's
cardiac and smooth muscles are managed by 
the autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump
roughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body 
with blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts
and relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth
internal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and
push food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract
when a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy
and produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides 
about 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels
then spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain
the temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system 
may be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost
everything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye
or a race to the finish line.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 9: Identify the type of muscle that lines the blood vessels and certain organs, such as the intestine and uterus. Options: A. Skeletal muscle, B. Cardiac muscle, C. Smooth muscle, D. Adipose tissue Correct Option: C**

However, this question only partially matches the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks about smooth muscle, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about all three types of muscles.

A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the composition of the muscular system, including all three types of muscles. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the closest match, I would say that **none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ**. However, if I had to choose the closest one, I would say that **Question 9** is the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would say that the generated MCQs are missing a question that asks about the composition of the muscular system, including all three types of muscles. If such a question existed, it would be the closest match to the ground truth MCQ.

In this case, I would recommend creating a new question that asks about the composition of the muscular system, including all three types of muscles, to provide a more accurate match to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to provide an index, I would say that the closest match is **Question 9**, but please note that it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 1 is asking about the number of muscles in the human body, it's not a direct match.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the proportion or percentage of the body's weight made up by a specific system. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the proportion of the body's weight made up by the skeletal or muscular system.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of asking about a specific proportion or percentage, I would choose Question 6. It asks about the percentage of body warmth provided by muscles, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on proportions.

However, please note that this is a stretch, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the proportion of the body's weight made up by the skeletal or muscular system.

**Transcript**:
Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison
to lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It's just one of the many thousands
of tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles
covers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for 
the heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly 
is the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches
via tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only
found in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines
the blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are 
made up of muscle cells, also known as fibers,
bundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from
the nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn
generates force and motion. This produces almost all
the movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed 
by the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split
into three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers
and lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten
while the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it 
bend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship 
is reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership
exists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction
creates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers
don't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee
or lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture
by holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk
of the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us,
like the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so,
like the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek
to your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment
called the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are
connected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control
over their movements. This muscle group also contains
two types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further,
slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly
when triggered but quickly use up their energy
and tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,
are endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly
so they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more
fast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly,
pick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain 
more slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's
cardiac and smooth muscles are managed by 
the autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump
roughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body 
with blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts
and relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth
internal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and
push food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract
when a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy
and produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides 
about 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels
then spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain
the temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system 
may be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost
everything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye
or a race to the finish line.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, a group of ranchers in Idaho were baffled when their sheep gave birth
to lambs with a singular deformity. Mystified by these cyclops sheep, they called in scientists from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to investigate. The researchers hypothesized
that the pregnant ewes had snacked on poisonous 
birth defect-causing plants. They collected the local flora
and fed samples to lab rats, but struggled to replicate the effect. So they decided 
to directly observe the sheep with one scientist even living
with the herd for three summers. After a decade of trial and error,
the scientists finally found the culprit, wild corn lilies. The lilies contained an active molecule
with six connected rings that they named cyclopamine
in reference to the cyclops sheep. They didn't know exactly
how cyclopamine caused the defect but told ranchers to steer clear. It took about four decades before
a team of biologists, led by Professor Philip Beachy, stumbled upon the answer. His lab was studying a specific gene
found in many species, from mice to humans, called the hedgehog gene. It was named by two scientists, who later
shared the Noble Prize for their work, who found that mutating 
this gene in fruit flies produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog. Beachy and his colleagues performed
genetic modifications to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice. This resulted in severe defects 
in the development of their brains, organs, and eyes or, rather, eye. Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy 
came across photos of the cyclops sheep and realized what had eluded scientists
for four decades. Something must have gone awry 
involving the hedgehog gene. Let's take a step back. Genes contain instructions that tell
cells what to do and when to do it, and they communicate their directives
using proteins. The hedgehog gene itself tells cells
to release a so-called hedgehog protein, which kicks off a complex 
series of cellular signals. Here's how it works in normal
healthy development. Hedgehog protein latches on to
a protein called patched. That inhibits, or holds, patched back, allowing another protein called
smoothened to freely signal the cells, telling them where to go
and what kind of tissues to become. Cyclopamine, say in the form 
of a delicious corn lily, interrupts this pathway
by binding onto smoothened. That locks smoothened up so that
it's unable to send the signals needed to mold the brain 
into two hemispheres, and form fingers or separate eyes. So even though the hedgehog
protein is still doing its job of keeping the way clear for smoothened, cyclopamine blocks smoothened
from passing along its chemical message. That settled the science
behind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team 
caught the glimmer of another more beneficial connection. They noted that uncontrolled activation
of the smoothened protein was associated with a human syndrome. It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,
and it predisposes people to certain cancers. The scientists proposed putting cyclopamine's smoothened 
binding powers to good use as a treatment for these cancers, as long as the patient wasn't pregnant. Unfortunately, researchers eventually
found that cyclopamine causes negative side effects, and its chemical properties
make it difficult to work with. But they did discover that closely
related molecules are safe and effective, and two of these drugs were approved
in 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines. When those farmers first saw
the cyclops sheep, they could have chalked it up to
a freak genetic mutation and walked away. Instead, their decision to investigate
turned a mystery into medicine showing that sometimes
there's more than meets the eye.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reason behind the naming of the hedgehog gene, specifically why two scientists chose that name. The correct answer is that mutations in the gene caused spikes like a hedgehog to form on fruit flies' bodies.

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the naming of the hedgehog gene. However, Question 3 mentions the hedgehog gene and its effect on mice when turned off, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

But, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall topic and the hedgehog gene, I would choose:

**Question 3: What was the result of Professor Philip Beachy's lab turning off the hedgehog genes in mice?**

However, please note that this question does not directly ask about the naming of the hedgehog gene, but it is the closest in terms of topic and gene mentioned.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, a group of ranchers in Idaho were baffled when their sheep gave birth
to lambs with a singular deformity. Mystified by these cyclops sheep, they called in scientists from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to investigate. The researchers hypothesized
that the pregnant ewes had snacked on poisonous 
birth defect-causing plants. They collected the local flora
and fed samples to lab rats, but struggled to replicate the effect. So they decided 
to directly observe the sheep with one scientist even living
with the herd for three summers. After a decade of trial and error,
the scientists finally found the culprit, wild corn lilies. The lilies contained an active molecule
with six connected rings that they named cyclopamine
in reference to the cyclops sheep. They didn't know exactly
how cyclopamine caused the defect but told ranchers to steer clear. It took about four decades before
a team of biologists, led by Professor Philip Beachy, stumbled upon the answer. His lab was studying a specific gene
found in many species, from mice to humans, called the hedgehog gene. It was named by two scientists, who later
shared the Noble Prize for their work, who found that mutating 
this gene in fruit flies produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog. Beachy and his colleagues performed
genetic modifications to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice. This resulted in severe defects 
in the development of their brains, organs, and eyes or, rather, eye. Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy 
came across photos of the cyclops sheep and realized what had eluded scientists
for four decades. Something must have gone awry 
involving the hedgehog gene. Let's take a step back. Genes contain instructions that tell
cells what to do and when to do it, and they communicate their directives
using proteins. The hedgehog gene itself tells cells
to release a so-called hedgehog protein, which kicks off a complex 
series of cellular signals. Here's how it works in normal
healthy development. Hedgehog protein latches on to
a protein called patched. That inhibits, or holds, patched back, allowing another protein called
smoothened to freely signal the cells, telling them where to go
and what kind of tissues to become. Cyclopamine, say in the form 
of a delicious corn lily, interrupts this pathway
by binding onto smoothened. That locks smoothened up so that
it's unable to send the signals needed to mold the brain 
into two hemispheres, and form fingers or separate eyes. So even though the hedgehog
protein is still doing its job of keeping the way clear for smoothened, cyclopamine blocks smoothened
from passing along its chemical message. That settled the science
behind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team 
caught the glimmer of another more beneficial connection. They noted that uncontrolled activation
of the smoothened protein was associated with a human syndrome. It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,
and it predisposes people to certain cancers. The scientists proposed putting cyclopamine's smoothened 
binding powers to good use as a treatment for these cancers, as long as the patient wasn't pregnant. Unfortunately, researchers eventually
found that cyclopamine causes negative side effects, and its chemical properties
make it difficult to work with. But they did discover that closely
related molecules are safe and effective, and two of these drugs were approved
in 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines. When those farmers first saw
the cyclops sheep, they could have chalked it up to
a freak genetic mutation and walked away. Instead, their decision to investigate
turned a mystery into medicine showing that sometimes
there's more than meets the eye.

**Transcript**:
They say the pen is mightier 
than the sword, and authorities have often agreed. From outlawed religious tracts
and revolutionary manifestos to censored and burned books, we know the potential power
of words to overturn the social order. But as strange as it may seem, some numbers have also been considered
dangerous enough to ban. Our distant ancestors long counted
objects using simple tally marks. But as they developed agriculture and
began living together in larger groups, this was no longer enough. As numbers grew more complex, people began not just using them,
but thinking about what they are and how they work. And by 600 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece,
the study of numbers was well-developed. The mathematician Pythagoras
and his school of followers found numerical patterns in shapes,
music, and the stars. For them, mathematics held 
the deepest secrets of the universe. But one Pythagorean named Hippasus
discovered something disturbing. Some quantities, like the diagonal
of a square with sides of length one couldn't be expressed by any combination
of whole numbers or fractions, no matter how small. These numbers, 
which we call irrational numbers, were perceived as a threat to the Pythagorean's notion 
of a perfect universe. They imagined a reality 
that could be described with rational, numerical patterns. Historians write that Hippasus
was exhiled for publicizing his findings, while legends claim he was drowned
as punishment from the gods. While irrational numbers 
upset philosophers, later mathematical inventions
would draw attention from political 
and religious authorities, as well. In the Middle Ages, while Europe
was still using Roman numerals, other cultures had developed 
positional systems that included a symbol for zero. When Arab travelers brought this system
to the bustling maritime cities of Italy, its advantages for merchants
and bankers was clear. But the authorities were more wary. Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered
easier to forge or alter, especially since they were less
familiar to customers than to merchants. And the concept of zero opened 
the door to negative numbers and the recording of debt at a time when moneylending
was regarded with suspicion. In the 13th century, Florence banned
the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals for record keeping. And though they soon proved
too useful to ignore, controversies over zero 
and negative numbers continued for a long time. Negative numbers 
were dismissed as absurd well into the 19th century. And prominent mathematicians,
like Gerolamo Cardano, avoided using zero, even though it would have made it
much easier to find solutions to cubic and the quartic equations. Even today it's illegal to use
some numbers for different reasons. Some are banned because
of what they represent. For example, governments
have prohibited the display of numbers that have symbolic meaning, such as the date of a revolution or connections to oppositional 
political figures or parties. Other numbers are potentially illegal
because of the information they carry. Just about any information, whether text, image, video, or executable programs can
be translated into a string of numbers. But this means that protected information, whether copyrights, proprietary materials, or state secrets can also be represented as numbers, so possessing or publishing these numbers
may be treated as a criminal offense. This idea gathered attention in 2001 when code that could be used
to decrypt DVDs was widely shared and distributed
in the form of a large prime number. The idea of illegal numbers 
may sound absurd, but like words, written numbers are a way
of expressing concepts and information. And in a world where calculations 
and algorithms shape more and more of our lives, the mathematician's pencil
grows stronger by the day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since the ground truth MCQ is asking about rational numbers and none of the generated MCQs directly ask about rational numbers, I will choose the one that is closest to the topic of numbers and their classification.

The closest generated MCQ is Question 2, which asks about who discovered irrational numbers. While it does not directly ask about rational numbers, it is related to the topic of number classification.

**Transcript**:
They say the pen is mightier 
than the sword, and authorities have often agreed. From outlawed religious tracts
and revolutionary manifestos to censored and burned books, we know the potential power
of words to overturn the social order. But as strange as it may seem, some numbers have also been considered
dangerous enough to ban. Our distant ancestors long counted
objects using simple tally marks. But as they developed agriculture and
began living together in larger groups, this was no longer enough. As numbers grew more complex, people began not just using them,
but thinking about what they are and how they work. And by 600 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece,
the study of numbers was well-developed. The mathematician Pythagoras
and his school of followers found numerical patterns in shapes,
music, and the stars. For them, mathematics held 
the deepest secrets of the universe. But one Pythagorean named Hippasus
discovered something disturbing. Some quantities, like the diagonal
of a square with sides of length one couldn't be expressed by any combination
of whole numbers or fractions, no matter how small. These numbers, 
which we call irrational numbers, were perceived as a threat to the Pythagorean's notion 
of a perfect universe. They imagined a reality 
that could be described with rational, numerical patterns. Historians write that Hippasus
was exhiled for publicizing his findings, while legends claim he was drowned
as punishment from the gods. While irrational numbers 
upset philosophers, later mathematical inventions
would draw attention from political 
and religious authorities, as well. In the Middle Ages, while Europe
was still using Roman numerals, other cultures had developed 
positional systems that included a symbol for zero. When Arab travelers brought this system
to the bustling maritime cities of Italy, its advantages for merchants
and bankers was clear. But the authorities were more wary. Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered
easier to forge or alter, especially since they were less
familiar to customers than to merchants. And the concept of zero opened 
the door to negative numbers and the recording of debt at a time when moneylending
was regarded with suspicion. In the 13th century, Florence banned
the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals for record keeping. And though they soon proved
too useful to ignore, controversies over zero 
and negative numbers continued for a long time. Negative numbers 
were dismissed as absurd well into the 19th century. And prominent mathematicians,
like Gerolamo Cardano, avoided using zero, even though it would have made it
much easier to find solutions to cubic and the quartic equations. Even today it's illegal to use
some numbers for different reasons. Some are banned because
of what they represent. For example, governments
have prohibited the display of numbers that have symbolic meaning, such as the date of a revolution or connections to oppositional 
political figures or parties. Other numbers are potentially illegal
because of the information they carry. Just about any information, whether text, image, video, or executable programs can
be translated into a string of numbers. But this means that protected information, whether copyrights, proprietary materials, or state secrets can also be represented as numbers, so possessing or publishing these numbers
may be treated as a criminal offense. This idea gathered attention in 2001 when code that could be used
to decrypt DVDs was widely shared and distributed
in the form of a large prime number. The idea of illegal numbers 
may sound absurd, but like words, written numbers are a way
of expressing concepts and information. And in a world where calculations 
and algorithms shape more and more of our lives, the mathematician's pencil
grows stronger by the day.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question has the same intent as the ground truth MCQ, which is to ask why Arabic numerals (also referred to as Hindu-Arabic numerals) were banned in Florence. The correct option for both questions is also similar, with the ground truth MCQ stating that Arabic numerals were banned because they were "regarded as easy to adjust fraudulently" and Question 3 stating that they were banned because they were "easier to forge or alter, and less familiar to customers." 

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. However, the options provided in Question 9 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

A more accurate match can be found in Question 6 and Question 8, as they both touch on the idea of why some numbers are considered "illegal" today. Question 6 explains that any information can be translated into a string of numbers, making it potentially illegal to possess or publish, while Question 8 mentions that governments restrict the use of certain numbers by prohibiting their display due to symbolic meaning.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, as it directly addresses the idea that governments restrict the use of certain numbers due to their symbolic meaning, which is one of the reasons mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

But since the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, I would still provide the index of Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Look at your hand. How do you know it's really yours? It seems obvious, unless you've
experienced the rubber hand illusion. In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed
in front of you and your real hand is hidden
behind a screen. Both are simultaneously stroked
with a paint brush. No matter how much you remind yourself
the dummy hand isn't yours, you eventually start to feel like it is, and inevitably flinch
when it's threatened with a knife. That may just be a temporary trick,
but it speaks to a larger truth: our bodies, the physical, 
biological parts of us, and our minds, the thinking,
conscious aspects, have a complicated, tangled relationship. Which one primarily defines you
or your self? Are you a physical body that only
experiences thoughts and emotions as a result of biochemical interactions
in the brain? That would be a body with a mind. Or is there some non-physical part of you
that's pulling the strings but could live outside 
of your biological body? That would be a mind with a body. That takes us to an old question of whether the body 
and mind are two separate things. In a famous thought experiment, 16th-century philosopher 
René Descartes pointed out that even if all our physical sensations
were just a hallucinatory dream, our mind and thoughts 
would still be there. That, for him, was the ultimate proof
of our existence. And it led him to conclude that the conscious mind is something separate
from the material body that forms the core of our identity. The notion of a non-physical consciousness echoes the belief of many religions
in an immaterial soul for which the body is only 
a temporary shell. If we accept this, 
another problem emerges. How can a non-physical mind have
any interaction with the physical body? If the mind has no shape, 
weight, or motion, how can it move your muscles? Or if we assume it can, why can your mind
only move your body and not others? Some thinkers have found creative ways
to get around this dilemma. For example, the French priest 
and philosopher Nicolas Malebranche claimed that when we think about
reaching for a fork, it's actually god who moves our hand. Another priest philosopher 
named George Berkeley concluded that the material world
is an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions. This question of mind versus body
isn't just the domain of philosophers. With the development of psychology
and neuroscience, scientists have weighed in, as well. Many modern scientists reject the idea that there's any distinction 
between the mind and body. Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,
along with their physical senses, are deeply integrated 
with the activity in our brains to form what we call consciousness. From the day we're born, our mental development is formed
through our body's interaction with the external world. Every sight, sound, and touch create
new maps and representations in the brain that eventually become responsible
for regulating our experience of self. And we have other senses,
besides the typical five, such as the sense of balance and a sense of the relative location
of our body parts. The rubber hand illusion,
and similar virtual reality experiments, show that our senses can easily
mislead us in our judgment of self. They also suggest that our bodies
and external sensations are inseparable from 
our subjective consciousness. If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'
experiment was mistaken from the start. After all, if we close our eyes
in a silent room, the feeling of having a body
isn't something we can just imagine away. This question of mind and body
becomes particularly interesting at a time when we're considering
future technologies, such as neural prosthetics
and wearable robots that could become extended parts
of our bodies. Or the slightly more radical idea
of mind uploading, which dangles the possibility 
of immortal life without a body by transferring a human consciousness
into a computer. If the body is deeply mapped
in the brain, then by extending our sense of self
to new wearable devices, our brains may eventually adapt
to a restructured version with new sensory representations. Or perhaps uploading our consciousness
into a computer might not even be possible unless we can also simulate a body
capable of delivering physical sensations. The idea that our bodies are part
of our consciousness and vice versa also isn't new. It's found extensively 
in Buddhist thought, as well as the writings of philosophers
from Heidegger to Aristotle. But for now, we're still left
with the open question of what exactly our self is. Are we a mind equipped with
a physical body as Descartes suggested? Or a complex organism 
that's gained consciousness over millions of years of evolution thanks to a bigger brain and
more neurons than our distant ancestors? Or something else entirely that
no one's yet dreamt up?

**Question 1: What is the main idea behind the rubber hand illusion experiment?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the two sensory inputs, its options and content are related to the rubber hand illusion, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the sensory inputs involved in the rubber hand illusion. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would select:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose, I would select Question 1 as the most similar, although it's not a direct match.**

To provide a more accurate answer, I would recommend generating new MCQs that directly address the topic of sensory inputs in the rubber hand illusion. One possible example of such a generated MCQ could be:

**Generated MCQ:** What two sensory inputs are synchronized in the rubber hand illusion to create the illusion of ownership?
**Options:** A. Touch and sound, B. Touch and vision, C. Vision and pain, D. Vision and proprioception

This generated MCQ would be a more direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Look at your hand. How do you know it's really yours? It seems obvious, unless you've
experienced the rubber hand illusion. In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed
in front of you and your real hand is hidden
behind a screen. Both are simultaneously stroked
with a paint brush. No matter how much you remind yourself
the dummy hand isn't yours, you eventually start to feel like it is, and inevitably flinch
when it's threatened with a knife. That may just be a temporary trick,
but it speaks to a larger truth: our bodies, the physical, 
biological parts of us, and our minds, the thinking,
conscious aspects, have a complicated, tangled relationship. Which one primarily defines you
or your self? Are you a physical body that only
experiences thoughts and emotions as a result of biochemical interactions
in the brain? That would be a body with a mind. Or is there some non-physical part of you
that's pulling the strings but could live outside 
of your biological body? That would be a mind with a body. That takes us to an old question of whether the body 
and mind are two separate things. In a famous thought experiment, 16th-century philosopher 
René Descartes pointed out that even if all our physical sensations
were just a hallucinatory dream, our mind and thoughts 
would still be there. That, for him, was the ultimate proof
of our existence. And it led him to conclude that the conscious mind is something separate
from the material body that forms the core of our identity. The notion of a non-physical consciousness echoes the belief of many religions
in an immaterial soul for which the body is only 
a temporary shell. If we accept this, 
another problem emerges. How can a non-physical mind have
any interaction with the physical body? If the mind has no shape, 
weight, or motion, how can it move your muscles? Or if we assume it can, why can your mind
only move your body and not others? Some thinkers have found creative ways
to get around this dilemma. For example, the French priest 
and philosopher Nicolas Malebranche claimed that when we think about
reaching for a fork, it's actually god who moves our hand. Another priest philosopher 
named George Berkeley concluded that the material world
is an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions. This question of mind versus body
isn't just the domain of philosophers. With the development of psychology
and neuroscience, scientists have weighed in, as well. Many modern scientists reject the idea that there's any distinction 
between the mind and body. Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,
along with their physical senses, are deeply integrated 
with the activity in our brains to form what we call consciousness. From the day we're born, our mental development is formed
through our body's interaction with the external world. Every sight, sound, and touch create
new maps and representations in the brain that eventually become responsible
for regulating our experience of self. And we have other senses,
besides the typical five, such as the sense of balance and a sense of the relative location
of our body parts. The rubber hand illusion,
and similar virtual reality experiments, show that our senses can easily
mislead us in our judgment of self. They also suggest that our bodies
and external sensations are inseparable from 
our subjective consciousness. If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'
experiment was mistaken from the start. After all, if we close our eyes
in a silent room, the feeling of having a body
isn't something we can just imagine away. This question of mind and body
becomes particularly interesting at a time when we're considering
future technologies, such as neural prosthetics
and wearable robots that could become extended parts
of our bodies. Or the slightly more radical idea
of mind uploading, which dangles the possibility 
of immortal life without a body by transferring a human consciousness
into a computer. If the body is deeply mapped
in the brain, then by extending our sense of self
to new wearable devices, our brains may eventually adapt
to a restructured version with new sensory representations. Or perhaps uploading our consciousness
into a computer might not even be possible unless we can also simulate a body
capable of delivering physical sensations. The idea that our bodies are part
of our consciousness and vice versa also isn't new. It's found extensively 
in Buddhist thought, as well as the writings of philosophers
from Heidegger to Aristotle. But for now, we're still left
with the open question of what exactly our self is. Are we a mind equipped with
a physical body as Descartes suggested? Or a complex organism 
that's gained consciousness over millions of years of evolution thanks to a bigger brain and
more neurons than our distant ancestors? Or something else entirely that
no one's yet dreamt up?

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Look at your hand. How do you know it's really yours? It seems obvious, unless you've
experienced the rubber hand illusion. In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed
in front of you and your real hand is hidden
behind a screen. Both are simultaneously stroked
with a paint brush. No matter how much you remind yourself
the dummy hand isn't yours, you eventually start to feel like it is, and inevitably flinch
when it's threatened with a knife. That may just be a temporary trick,
but it speaks to a larger truth: our bodies, the physical, 
biological parts of us, and our minds, the thinking,
conscious aspects, have a complicated, tangled relationship. Which one primarily defines you
or your self? Are you a physical body that only
experiences thoughts and emotions as a result of biochemical interactions
in the brain? That would be a body with a mind. Or is there some non-physical part of you
that's pulling the strings but could live outside 
of your biological body? That would be a mind with a body. That takes us to an old question of whether the body 
and mind are two separate things. In a famous thought experiment, 16th-century philosopher 
René Descartes pointed out that even if all our physical sensations
were just a hallucinatory dream, our mind and thoughts 
would still be there. That, for him, was the ultimate proof
of our existence. And it led him to conclude that the conscious mind is something separate
from the material body that forms the core of our identity. The notion of a non-physical consciousness echoes the belief of many religions
in an immaterial soul for which the body is only 
a temporary shell. If we accept this, 
another problem emerges. How can a non-physical mind have
any interaction with the physical body? If the mind has no shape, 
weight, or motion, how can it move your muscles? Or if we assume it can, why can your mind
only move your body and not others? Some thinkers have found creative ways
to get around this dilemma. For example, the French priest 
and philosopher Nicolas Malebranche claimed that when we think about
reaching for a fork, it's actually god who moves our hand. Another priest philosopher 
named George Berkeley concluded that the material world
is an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions. This question of mind versus body
isn't just the domain of philosophers. With the development of psychology
and neuroscience, scientists have weighed in, as well. Many modern scientists reject the idea that there's any distinction 
between the mind and body. Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,
along with their physical senses, are deeply integrated 
with the activity in our brains to form what we call consciousness. From the day we're born, our mental development is formed
through our body's interaction with the external world. Every sight, sound, and touch create
new maps and representations in the brain that eventually become responsible
for regulating our experience of self. And we have other senses,
besides the typical five, such as the sense of balance and a sense of the relative location
of our body parts. The rubber hand illusion,
and similar virtual reality experiments, show that our senses can easily
mislead us in our judgment of self. They also suggest that our bodies
and external sensations are inseparable from 
our subjective consciousness. If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'
experiment was mistaken from the start. After all, if we close our eyes
in a silent room, the feeling of having a body
isn't something we can just imagine away. This question of mind and body
becomes particularly interesting at a time when we're considering
future technologies, such as neural prosthetics
and wearable robots that could become extended parts
of our bodies. Or the slightly more radical idea
of mind uploading, which dangles the possibility 
of immortal life without a body by transferring a human consciousness
into a computer. If the body is deeply mapped
in the brain, then by extending our sense of self
to new wearable devices, our brains may eventually adapt
to a restructured version with new sensory representations. Or perhaps uploading our consciousness
into a computer might not even be possible unless we can also simulate a body
capable of delivering physical sensations. The idea that our bodies are part
of our consciousness and vice versa also isn't new. It's found extensively 
in Buddhist thought, as well as the writings of philosophers
from Heidegger to Aristotle. But for now, we're still left
with the open question of what exactly our self is. Are we a mind equipped with
a physical body as Descartes suggested? Or a complex organism 
that's gained consciousness over millions of years of evolution thanks to a bigger brain and
more neurons than our distant ancestors? Or something else entirely that
no one's yet dreamt up?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What do many modern scientists believe about the relationship between the mind and body? Options: A. They are separate entities with distinct functions., B. They are deeply integrated, with the body playing a crucial role in shaping the mind., C. The mind is a non-physical entity that animates the body., D. The body is merely a vessel for the mind. Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about a specific philosopher's view. A more relevant question would be one that asks about a philosopher's perspective on the relationship between the mind and body.

A closer match would be:

**Question 5: What is the main idea behind George Berkeley's philosophical view? Options: A. The material world exists independently of our perceptions., B. The material world is an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions., C. The mind and body are separate entities., D. The mind is a product of the brain's activity. Correct Option: B**

However, this question is about George Berkeley's view, not the philosopher mentioned in the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ (Martin Heidegger).

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 6** is the most similar in terms of question intent and content, although it does not mention a specific philosopher.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The first standardized tests 
that we know of were administered in China 
over 2,000 years ago during the Han dynasty. Chinese officials used them to determine
aptitude for various government posts. The subject matter included philosophy, farming, and even military tactics. Standardized tests continued to be used
around the world for the next two millennia, and today, they're used for everything from evaluating stair climbs
for firefighters in France to language examinations 
for diplomats in Canada to students in schools. Some standardized tests measure scores only in relation to the results 
of other test takers. Others measure performances on how well
test takers meet predetermined criteria. So the stair climb for the firefighter could be measured by comparing 
the time of the climb to that of all other firefighters. This might be expressed in what 
many call a bell curve. Or it could be evaluated with reference
to set criteria, such as carrying a certain amount 
of weight a certain distance up a certain number of stairs. Similarly, the diplomat might be measured
against other test-taking diplomats, or against a set of fixed criteria, which demonstrate different levels
of language proficiency. And all of these results can be expressed
using something called a percentile. If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile,
70% of test takers scored below her. If she scored in the 30th percentile,
70% of test takers scored above her. Although standardized tests 
are sometimes controversial, they're simply a tool. As a thought experiment, 
think of a standardized test as a ruler. A ruler's usefulness 
depends on two things. First, the job we ask it to do. Our ruler can't measure 
the temperature outside or how loud someone is singing. Second, the ruler's usefulness depends
on its design. Say you need to measure the circumference
of an orange. Our ruler measures length,
which is the right quantity, but it hasn't been designed with the 
flexibility required for the task at hand. So, if standardized tests are given
the wrong job, or aren't designed properly, they may end up measuring
the wrong things. In the case of schools, students with test anxiety may have 
trouble performing their best on a standardized test, not because they don't know the answers, but because they're feeling too nervous
to share what they've learned. Students with reading challenges may struggle with the wording 
of a math problem, so their test results may better reflect
their literacy rather than numeracy skills. And students who were confused by examples on tests that contain 
unfamiliar cultural references may do poorly, telling us more about the test taker's
cultural familiarity than their academic learning. In these cases, the tests may need
to be designed differently. Standardized tests can also 
have a hard time measuring abstract 
characteristics or skills, such as creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration. If we design a test poorly, or ask it to do the wrong job, or a job it's not very good at, the results may not be reliable or valid. Reliability and validity 
are two critical ideas for understanding standardized tests. To understand the difference between them, we can use the metaphor 
of two broken thermometers. An unreliable thermometer gives you a different reading 
each time you take your temperature, and the reliable but invalid thermometer
is consistently ten degrees too hot. Validity also depends on accurate
interpretations of results. If people say results of a test
mean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler
to tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone
to reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle
a tough situation, or how brave a firefighter 
might turn out to be. So standardized tests may help us learn
a little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot
about a single person. Many social scientists worry about
test scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes
for test takers, sometimes with long-term 
life consequences. We can't blame the tests, though. It's up to us to use the right tests
for the right jobs, and to interpret results appropriately.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. However, Question 1 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks about the dynasty in which the first standardized tests were administered in China, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about where and for what the standardized tests were first used.

A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the location and purpose of the first standardized tests. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 1, as it at least mentions the correct location (China) and provides some information about the historical context of the first standardized tests.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question is about the two methods of measuring a firefighter's stair climb test, which aligns with the ground truth MCQ's topic of measuring test takers against other test takers or predetermined criteria. Although the subjects and context are different, the core idea of having two methods of measurement is the same.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the two methods of measurement (comparing to others or to a set standard) in a more general context, rather than being specific to the firefighter's stair climb test.

Unfortunately, there isn't a more suitable generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ. But among the given options, Question 3 is the closest match.

mean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler
to tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone
to reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle
a tough situation, or how brave a firefighter

a little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot
about a single person. Many social scientists worry about
test scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes
for test takers, sometimes with long-term

**Transcript**:
The first standardized tests 
that we know of were administered in China 
over 2,000 years ago during the Han dynasty. Chinese officials used them to determine
aptitude for various government posts. The subject matter included philosophy, farming, and even military tactics. Standardized tests continued to be used
around the world for the next two millennia, and today, they're used for everything from evaluating stair climbs
for firefighters in France to language examinations 
for diplomats in Canada to students in schools. Some standardized tests measure scores only in relation to the results 
of other test takers. Others measure performances on how well
test takers meet predetermined criteria. So the stair climb for the firefighter could be measured by comparing 
the time of the climb to that of all other firefighters. This might be expressed in what 
many call a bell curve. Or it could be evaluated with reference
to set criteria, such as carrying a certain amount 
of weight a certain distance up a certain number of stairs. Similarly, the diplomat might be measured
against other test-taking diplomats, or against a set of fixed criteria, which demonstrate different levels
of language proficiency. And all of these results can be expressed
using something called a percentile. If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile,
70% of test takers scored below her. If she scored in the 30th percentile,
70% of test takers scored above her. Although standardized tests 
are sometimes controversial, they're simply a tool. As a thought experiment, 
think of a standardized test as a ruler. A ruler's usefulness 
depends on two things. First, the job we ask it to do. Our ruler can't measure 
the temperature outside or how loud someone is singing. Second, the ruler's usefulness depends
on its design. Say you need to measure the circumference
of an orange. Our ruler measures length,
which is the right quantity, but it hasn't been designed with the 
flexibility required for the task at hand. So, if standardized tests are given
the wrong job, or aren't designed properly, they may end up measuring
the wrong things. In the case of schools, students with test anxiety may have 
trouble performing their best on a standardized test, not because they don't know the answers, but because they're feeling too nervous
to share what they've learned. Students with reading challenges may struggle with the wording 
of a math problem, so their test results may better reflect
their literacy rather than numeracy skills. And students who were confused by examples on tests that contain 
unfamiliar cultural references may do poorly, telling us more about the test taker's
cultural familiarity than their academic learning. In these cases, the tests may need
to be designed differently. Standardized tests can also 
have a hard time measuring abstract 
characteristics or skills, such as creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration. If we design a test poorly, or ask it to do the wrong job, or a job it's not very good at, the results may not be reliable or valid. Reliability and validity 
are two critical ideas for understanding standardized tests. To understand the difference between them, we can use the metaphor 
of two broken thermometers. An unreliable thermometer gives you a different reading 
each time you take your temperature, and the reliable but invalid thermometer
is consistently ten degrees too hot. Validity also depends on accurate
interpretations of results. If people say results of a test
mean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler
to tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone
to reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle
a tough situation, or how brave a firefighter 
might turn out to be. So standardized tests may help us learn
a little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot
about a single person. Many social scientists worry about
test scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes
for test takers, sometimes with long-term 
life consequences. We can't blame the tests, though. It's up to us to use the right tests
for the right jobs, and to interpret results appropriately.

**Transcript**:
On January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln legally changed the status
of over 3 million enslaved blacks across ten states from slave to free. His Emancipation Proclamation 
wasn't a law, or a presidential decree. It was an executive order. The framers of the American Constitution
made the power of executive order available to the executive branch. But what exactly is this tool? How does it work? And what is the extent of its power? Well, an executive order isn't a law,
but it can carry the weight of one. Passing laws involves 
a fairly lengthy process. First, a member of Congress proposes
a piece of legislation in the form of a bill. After many committees and revisions, if the bill is approved 
by a majority votes in Congress, that is both the House and Senate, the bill is then sent to 
the president for signature. If the president signs the bill,
it then becomes a law. An executive order, on the other hand, is something the president issues
without consultation or permission from Congress. They are, however, enforced like laws, and are subject to judicial review
by the court system to make sure they're within the limits
of the Constitution. That means the courts have the power
to invalidate any executive decisions that they determine are an overreach of
the president in trying to assert power. And once the president leaves office, if his or her successor wants to eliminate
the executive order, they can do so. So when does a president 
use an executive order? Sometimes a president feels the need to
exert power without working with Congress, and in times of crisis, quick decisions
can be justified. But most executive orders are not 
responses to emergencies. They're often directed towards
agencies in the federal government in order to expand 
or contract their power. Others determine the extent
to which legislation should be enforced. And sometimes, a president may use
an executive order to clarify and help implement a policy
that needs to be easily defined. Some of the most famous executive orders have changed the course 
of American history. FDR issued an executive order to establish
the Works Progress Administration, which helped build thousands of roads,
bridges, and parks throughout the country. The WPA also employed 
thousands of writers, painters, sculptors, and artists to create works of art
in public spaces. Additionally, Harry Truman used
an executive order to desegregate the armed forces in 1948. And in 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed
an executive order to establish requirements 
for nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and employment. Executive orders have often been used
in positive and inclusive ways, but they've also been used 
to exclude and divide. One of the most notable examples being
FDR's 1942 executive order. He gave the military authority to target
predominantly Japanese-Americans, as well as German-Americans
and Italian-Americans, in certain regions across the country. This executive order also removed any or
all of those people into military zones, most commonly known as internment camps. Beginning in the early 1960s, each president has issued 
roughly 300 executive orders, but FDR issued over 3,500. At the other end of the spectrum, William Henry Harrison never issued
an executive order, probably because his presidency only
lasted 31 days. The U.S. Constitution is somewhat ambiguous
on the extent of the president's power. That's resulted in executive orders
expanding over time. For instance, since Lyndon Johnson, presidents have begun issuing orders
to create faith-based initiatives, establish federal agencies, and remove barriers 
for scientific research. There are checks and balances 
in the U.S. political system. Congress can pass laws to counteract
executive orders, and judges can halt them by deeming them
unconstitutional. But in the time it takes 
for those things to happen, an executive order can go into effect and possibly change the course of history,
for better or for worse.

can be justified. But most executive orders are not 
responses to emergencies. They're often directed towards
agencies in the federal government in order to expand 
or contract their power. Others determine the extent
to which legislation should be enforced. And sometimes, a president may use
an executive order to clarify and help implement a policy
that needs to be easily defined. Some of the most famous executive orders have changed the course 
of American history. FDR issued an executive order to establish
the Works Progress Administration, which helped build thousands of roads,
bridges, and parks throughout the country. The WPA also employed 
thousands of writers, painters, sculptors, and artists to create works of art
in public spaces. Additionally, Harry Truman used
an executive order to desegregate the armed forces in 1948. And in 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed
an executive order to establish requirements 
for nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and employment. Executive orders have often been used
in positive and inclusive ways, but they've also been used 
to exclude and divide. One of the most notable examples being
FDR's 1942 executive order. He gave the military authority to target
predominantly Japanese-Americans, as well as German-Americans
and Italian-Americans, in certain regions across the country. This executive order also removed any or
all of those people into military zones, most commonly known as internment camps. Beginning in the early 1960s, each president has issued 
roughly 300 executive orders, but FDR issued over 3,500. At the other end of the spectrum, William Henry Harrison never issued
an executive order, probably because his presidency only
lasted 31 days. The U.S. Constitution is somewhat ambiguous
on the extent of the president's power. That's resulted in executive orders
expanding over time. For instance, since Lyndon Johnson, presidents have begun issuing orders
to create faith-based initiatives, establish federal agencies, and remove barriers 
for scientific research. There are checks and balances 
in the U.S. political system. Congress can pass laws to counteract
executive orders, and judges can halt them by deeming them
unconstitutional. But in the time it takes 
for those things to happen, an executive order can go into effect and possibly change the course of history,
for better or for worse.

**Transcript**:
On January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln legally changed the status
of over 3 million enslaved blacks across ten states from slave to free. His Emancipation Proclamation 
wasn't a law, or a presidential decree. It was an executive order. The framers of the American Constitution
made the power of executive order available to the executive branch. But what exactly is this tool? How does it work? And what is the extent of its power? Well, an executive order isn't a law,
but it can carry the weight of one. Passing laws involves 
a fairly lengthy process. First, a member of Congress proposes
a piece of legislation in the form of a bill. After many committees and revisions, if the bill is approved 
by a majority votes in Congress, that is both the House and Senate, the bill is then sent to 
the president for signature. If the president signs the bill,
it then becomes a law. An executive order, on the other hand, is something the president issues
without consultation or permission from Congress. They are, however, enforced like laws, and are subject to judicial review
by the court system to make sure they're within the limits
of the Constitution. That means the courts have the power
to invalidate any executive decisions that they determine are an overreach of
the president in trying to assert power. And once the president leaves office, if his or her successor wants to eliminate
the executive order, they can do so. So when does a president 
use an executive order? Sometimes a president feels the need to
exert power without working with Congress, and in times of crisis, quick decisions
can be justified. But most executive orders are not 
responses to emergencies. They're often directed towards

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, a combination of Question 8 and Question 3 is a better match.

A more suitable match can be found by combining elements from multiple questions. Question 8 states that Congress can pass a law to override an executive order, and Question 3 states that the courts can invalidate an order if it's deemed an overreach of power. These two questions, when combined, convey the same message as the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one question from the list of generated MCQs that best matches the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 9 is not the best choice, a better choice is Question 8, it is the most similar to the correct answer "D. Both A and B", as it says "Congress can pass a law to override the order", this is the "A" part of the correct answer, the "B" part is not present in this question but is present in Question 3.

However, the best answer is not present, I will choose the closest one:

**Transcript**:
At about six o'clock in the morning
on September 14, 2015, scientists witnessed something
no human had ever seen: two black holes colliding. Both about 30 times as massive
as our Sun, they had been orbiting each other
for millions of years. As they got closer together, they circled each other faster and faster. Finally, they collided and merged
into a single, even bigger, black hole. A fraction of a second before their crash, they sent a vibration across the universe
at the speed of light. And on Earth, billions of years later, a detector called the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory, or LIGO for short, picked it up. The signal only lasted a fifth of a second and was the detector's first observation
of gravitational waves. What are these ripples in space? The answer starts with gravity, the force that pulls any 
two objects together. That's the case for everything
In the observable universe. You're pulling on the Earth,
the Moon, the Sun, and every single star, and they're pulling on you. The more mass something has,
the stronger its gravitational pull. The farther away the object,
the lower its pull. If every mass has an effect
on every other mass in the universe, no matter how small, then changes in gravity can tell us
about what those objects are doing. Fluctuations in the gravity
coming from the universe are called gravitational waves. Gravitational waves move out from 
what caused them, like ripples on a pond, getting smaller as they travel farther
from their center. But what are they ripples on? When Einstein devised 
his Theory of Relativity, he imagined gravity as a curve
in a surface called space-time. A mass in space creates a depression
in space-time, and a ball rolling across a depression
will curve like it's being attracted 
to the other mass. The bigger the mass, the deeper the depression
and the stronger the gravity. When the mass making the depression moves,
that sends out ripples in space-time. These are gravitationl waves. What would a gravitational wave feel like? If our bodies were sensitive enough
to detect them, we'd feel like we were 
being stretched sideways while being compressed vertically. And in the next instant, stretched up and down 
while being compressed horizontally, sideways, then up and down. This back and forth would happen
over and over as the gravitational wave
passed right through you. But this happens on such a minute scale
that we can't feel any of it. So we've built detectors 
that can feel it for us. That's what the LIGO detectors do. And they're not the only ones. There are gravitational wave detectors
spread across the world. These L-shaped instruments have long arms, whose exact length 
is measured with lasers. If the length changes, it could be because
gravitational waves are stretching and compressing the arms. Once the detectors feel 
a gravitational wave, scientists can extract information
about the wave's source. In a way, detectors like LIGO are
big gravitational wave radios. Radio waves are traveling all around you,
but you can't feel them or hear the music they carry. It takes the right kind of 
detector to extract the music. LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal, which scientists then study for data
about the object that generated it. They can derive information, 
like its mass and the shape of its orbit. We can also hear gravitational waves
by playing their signals through speakers, just like the music a radio extracts
from radio waves. So those two black holes colliding
sounds like this. Scientists call this 
slide whistle-like noise a chirp, and it's the signature of any two
objects orbiting into each other. The black hole collision 
was just one example of what gravitational waves can tell us. Other high-energy astronomical events
will leave gravitational echoes, too. The collapse of a star before it
explodes in a supernova, or a very dense neutron stars colliding. Every time we create a new tool
to look at space, we discover something we didn't expect, something that might revolutionize
our understanding of the universe. LIGO's no different. In the short time it's been on, LIGO's already revealed surprises, like that black holes collide
more often than we ever expected. It's impossible to say,

**Transcript**:
At about six o'clock in the morning
on September 14, 2015, scientists witnessed something
no human had ever seen: two black holes colliding. Both about 30 times as massive
as our Sun, they had been orbiting each other
for millions of years. As they got closer together, they circled each other faster and faster. Finally, they collided and merged
into a single, even bigger, black hole. A fraction of a second before their crash, they sent a vibration across the universe
at the speed of light. And on Earth, billions of years later, a detector called the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory, or LIGO for short, picked it up. The signal only lasted a fifth of a second and was the detector's first observation
of gravitational waves. What are these ripples in space? The answer starts with gravity, the force that pulls any 
two objects together. That's the case for everything
In the observable universe. You're pulling on the Earth,
the Moon, the Sun, and every single star, and they're pulling on you. The more mass something has,
the stronger its gravitational pull. The farther away the object,
the lower its pull. If every mass has an effect
on every other mass in the universe, no matter how small, then changes in gravity can tell us
about what those objects are doing. Fluctuations in the gravity
coming from the universe are called gravitational waves. Gravitational waves move out from 
what caused them, like ripples on a pond, getting smaller as they travel farther
from their center. But what are they ripples on? When Einstein devised 
his Theory of Relativity, he imagined gravity as a curve
in a surface called space-time. A mass in space creates a depression
in space-time, and a ball rolling across a depression
will curve like it's being attracted 
to the other mass. The bigger the mass, the deeper the depression
and the stronger the gravity. When the mass making the depression moves,
that sends out ripples in space-time. These are gravitationl waves. What would a gravitational wave feel like? If our bodies were sensitive enough
to detect them, we'd feel like we were 
being stretched sideways while being compressed vertically. And in the next instant, stretched up and down 
while being compressed horizontally, sideways, then up and down. This back and forth would happen
over and over as the gravitational wave
passed right through you. But this happens on such a minute scale
that we can't feel any of it. So we've built detectors 
that can feel it for us. That's what the LIGO detectors do. And they're not the only ones. There are gravitational wave detectors
spread across the world. These L-shaped instruments have long arms, whose exact length 
is measured with lasers. If the length changes, it could be because
gravitational waves are stretching and compressing the arms. Once the detectors feel 
a gravitational wave, scientists can extract information
about the wave's source. In a way, detectors like LIGO are
big gravitational wave radios. Radio waves are traveling all around you,
but you can't feel them or hear the music they carry. It takes the right kind of 
detector to extract the music. LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal, which scientists then study for data
about the object that generated it. They can derive information, 
like its mass and the shape of its orbit. We can also hear gravitational waves

the Moon, the Sun, and every single star, and they're pulling on you. The more mass something has,
the stronger its gravitational pull. The farther away the object,
the lower its pull. If every mass has an effect
on every other mass in the universe, no matter how small, then changes in gravity can tell us
about what those objects are doing. Fluctuations in the gravity
coming from the universe are called gravitational waves. Gravitational waves move out from 
what caused them, like ripples on a pond, getting smaller as they travel farther
from their center. But what are they ripples on? When Einstein devised 
his Theory of Relativity, he imagined gravity as a curve
in a surface called space-time. A mass in space creates a depression
in space-time, and a ball rolling across a depression
will curve like it's being attracted 
to the other mass. The bigger the mass, the deeper the depression
and the stronger the gravity. When the mass making the depression moves,
that sends out ripples in space-time. These are gravitationl waves. What would a gravitational wave feel like? If our bodies were sensitive enough
to detect them, we'd feel like we were 
being stretched sideways while being compressed vertically. And in the next instant, stretched up and down 
while being compressed horizontally, sideways, then up and down. This back and forth would happen
over and over as the gravitational wave
passed right through you. But this happens on such a minute scale
that we can't feel any of it. So we've built detectors 
that can feel it for us. That's what the LIGO detectors do. And they're not the only ones. There are gravitational wave detectors
spread across the world. These L-shaped instruments have long arms, whose exact length 
is measured with lasers. If the length changes, it could be because
gravitational waves are stretching and compressing the arms. Once the detectors feel 
a gravitational wave, scientists can extract information
about the wave's source. In a way, detectors like LIGO are
big gravitational wave radios. Radio waves are traveling all around you,
but you can't feel them or hear the music they carry. It takes the right kind of 
detector to extract the music. LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal, which scientists then study for data
about the object that generated it. They can derive information, 
like its mass and the shape of its orbit. We can also hear gravitational waves
by playing their signals through speakers, just like the music a radio extracts
from radio waves. So those two black holes colliding
sounds like this. Scientists call this 
slide whistle-like noise a chirp, and it's the signature of any two
objects orbiting into each other. The black hole collision 
was just one example of what gravitational waves can tell us. Other high-energy astronomical events
will leave gravitational echoes, too. The collapse of a star before it
explodes in a supernova, or a very dense neutron stars colliding. Every time we create a new tool
to look at space, we discover something we didn't expect, something that might revolutionize
our understanding of the universe. LIGO's no different. In the short time it's been on, LIGO's already revealed surprises, like that black holes collide
more often than we ever expected. It's impossible to say, 
but exciting to imagine, what revelations may now be propagating
across space towards our tiny blue planet and
its new way of perceiving the universe.

**Transcript**:
Every year, about 1,000 new words are
added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it 
into our everyday lives? With over 170,000 words currently in use
in the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps
in what we want to express and we fill those gaps 
in several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways. One way is to absorb a word
from another language. English has borrowed so many words
over its history that nearly half of its vocabulary 
comes directly from other languages. Sometimes, this is simply because
the thing the word describes was borrowed itself. Rome and France brought legal
and religious concepts, like altar and jury, to Medieval England, while trade brought crops and cuisine, like Arabic coffee, Italian spaghetti, and Indian curry. But sometimes, another language 
has just the right word for a complex idea or emotion, like naïveté machismo, or schadenfreude. Scientists also use classical languages
to name new concepts. Clone, for example, was derived from
the Ancient Greek word for twig to describe creating a new plant
from a piece of the old. And today, the process works both ways, with English lending words like software
to languages all over the world. Another popular way 
to fill a vocabulary gap is by combining existing words that each
convey part of the new concept. This can be done by combining two
whole words into a compound word, like airport or starfish, or by clipping and blending parts of words
together, like spork, brunch, or internet. And unlike borrowings 
from other languages, these can often be understood
the first time you hear them. And sometimes a new word isn't new at all. Obsolete words gain new life by adopting
new meanings. Villain originally meant a peasant farmer,
but in a twist of aristocratic snobbery came to mean someone not bound
by the knightly code of chivalry and, therefore, a bad person. A geek went from 
being a carnival performer to any strange person to a specific type of awkward genius. And other times, words come to mean
their opposite through irony, metaphor, or misuse, like when sick or wicked are used
to describe something literally amazing. But if words can be formed 
in all these ways, why do some become mainstream
while others fall out of use or never catch on in the first place? Sometimes, the answer is simple, as when scientists or companies 
give an official name to a new discovery or technology. And some countries have language academies
to make the decisions. But for the most part, official sources
like dictionaries only document current usage. New words don't originate from above,
but from ordinary people spreading words that 
hit the right combination of useful and catchy. Take the word meme, coined in the 1970s 
by sociobiologist Richard Dawkins from the Ancient Greek for imitation. He used it to describe how ideas
and symbols propagate through a culture like genes through a population. With the advent of the Internet, the process became directly observable
in how jokes and images were popularized at lightning speed. And soon, the word came to refer
to a certain kind of image. So meme not only describes how words
become part of language, the word is a meme itself. And there's a word for this phenomenon
of words that describe themselves: autological. Not all new words are created equal. Some stick around for millennia, some adapt to changing times, and others die off. Some relay information, some interpret it, but the way these words are created and the journey they take to become
part of our speech tells us a lot about our world
and how we communicate within it.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question is needed.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, Question 3 is not a perfect match, but Option A "Borrowing a word from another language" in Question 3 is similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ.

However, there is another question that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, that question is not present in the list. But among the existing questions, Question 3 has an option that matches the ground truth MCQ.

But if we consider the question content and intent, a more similar question would be one that asks about how words enter a language. In that case, Question 2 is the most similar, but the options do not exactly match.

Considering all the aspects, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but with a caveat that the options do not exactly match.

However, I must provide an index. In that case, I will provide the index of Question 2.

**Transcript**:
Every year, about 1,000 new words are
added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it 
into our everyday lives? With over 170,000 words currently in use
in the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps
in what we want to express and we fill those gaps 
in several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways. One way is to absorb a word
from another language. English has borrowed so many words
over its history that nearly half of its vocabulary 
comes directly from other languages. Sometimes, this is simply because
the thing the word describes was borrowed itself. Rome and France brought legal
and religious concepts, like altar and jury, to Medieval England, while trade brought crops and cuisine, like Arabic coffee, Italian spaghetti, and Indian curry. But sometimes, another language 
has just the right word for a complex idea or emotion, like naïveté machismo, or schadenfreude. Scientists also use classical languages
to name new concepts. Clone, for example, was derived from
the Ancient Greek word for twig to describe creating a new plant
from a piece of the old. And today, the process works both ways, with English lending words like software
to languages all over the world. Another popular way 
to fill a vocabulary gap is by combining existing words that each
convey part of the new concept. This can be done by combining two
whole words into a compound word, like airport or starfish, or by clipping and blending parts of words
together, like spork, brunch, or internet. And unlike borrowings 
from other languages, these can often be understood
the first time you hear them. And sometimes a new word isn't new at all. Obsolete words gain new life by adopting
new meanings. Villain originally meant a peasant farmer,
but in a twist of aristocratic snobbery came to mean someone not bound
by the knightly code of chivalry and, therefore, a bad person. A geek went from 
being a carnival performer to any strange person to a specific type of awkward genius. And other times, words come to mean
their opposite through irony, metaphor, or misuse, like when sick or wicked are used
to describe something literally amazing. But if words can be formed 
in all these ways, why do some become mainstream
while others fall out of use or never catch on in the first place? Sometimes, the answer is simple, as when scientists or companies 
give an official name to a new discovery or technology. And some countries have language academies
to make the decisions. But for the most part, official sources
like dictionaries only document current usage. New words don't originate from above,
but from ordinary people spreading words that 
hit the right combination of useful and catchy. Take the word meme, coined in the 1970s 
by sociobiologist Richard Dawkins from the Ancient Greek for imitation. He used it to describe how ideas
and symbols propagate through a culture like genes through a population. With the advent of the Internet, the process became directly observable
in how jokes and images were popularized at lightning speed. And soon, the word came to refer
to a certain kind of image. So meme not only describes how words
become part of language, the word is a meme itself. And there's a word for this phenomenon
of words that describe themselves: autological. Not all new words are created equal. Some stick around for millennia, some adapt to changing times, and others die off. Some relay information, some interpret it, but the way these words are created and the journey they take to become
part of our speech tells us a lot about our world
and how we communicate within it.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as the question and options are not identical.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about how obsolete words can gain new life. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the closest match based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 3 is not the best match. Instead, I would consider Question 4, which discusses the evolution of the word "geek" and how its meaning changed over time. This question is related to the concept of obsolete words gaining new life, but it does not directly address the topic.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 (index 4) is the closest match, although it is not a perfect match.

To create a perfect match, a new generated MCQ could be created that specifically asks about how obsolete words can gain new life, with options that include giving them new meanings, as in the ground truth MCQ.

Example of a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:
Question: How can obsolete words regain relevance in modern language?
Options: A. Through nostalgia, B. By legislation, C. As a result of technological advancements, D. By giving them new meanings
Correct Option: D

This new generated MCQ would be a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy
two billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common
garments in the world. But how and where is the average
t-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life
on a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and
grown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest
these puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically
separates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed 
into 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity
of water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce
the average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides
and pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton
grown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons 
of cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them
to a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into
snowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets 
of rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals
until they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into
commercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring
in about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain
cancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals
can cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water
in rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced
in some countries that the entire process of growing
and producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth 
travels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,
or Turkey, human labor is still required 
to stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that 
machines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's
biggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people
in the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions
and low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts
travel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton 
an enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce 
their own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts
for 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's
willingness to buy boosted global production 
from 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most
resource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly
400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers 
both use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times
more than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing 
consumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations
and the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable 
human labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second
largest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from
recycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry
to save resources. Instead of throwing them away
at the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them
as cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing
will you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined 
impact on the world?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent (water required to produce a t-shirt) and options (estimated amount of water needed). Although the ground truth MCQ also mentions pesticides, Question 4 is the closest match among the generated MCQs.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5, but it only addresses the environmental concern associated with the use of pesticides and does not mention the amount of water required.

A combination of Question 4 and Question 5 (or Question 6, which addresses the benefit of using organic cotton) would be a closer match to the ground truth MCQ, but since we are looking for a single question, Question 4 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy
two billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common
garments in the world. But how and where is the average
t-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life
on a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and
grown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest
these puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically
separates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed 
into 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity
of water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce
the average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides
and pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton
grown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons 
of cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them
to a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into
snowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets 
of rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals
until they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into
commercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring
in about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain
cancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals
can cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water
in rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced
in some countries that the entire process of growing
and producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth 
travels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,
or Turkey, human labor is still required 
to stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that 
machines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's
biggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people
in the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions
and low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts
travel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton 
an enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce 
their own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts
for 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's
willingness to buy boosted global production 
from 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most
resource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly
400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers 
both use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times
more than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing 
consumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations
and the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable 
human labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second
largest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from
recycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry
to save resources. Instead of throwing them away
at the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them
as cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing
will you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined 
impact on the world?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the term used to describe the snowy ropes of cotton produced to create fabric. The correct answer is "Slivers".

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 to Question 10, none directly ask about the term "Slivers". However, some questions are related to the production process of cotton and t-shirts.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6, which asks about the benefit of using organic cotton in t-shirt production. However, this question is not directly related to the term "Slivers".

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQs. In this case, a new generated MCQ could be created to ask about the term "Slivers" and its relation to the cotton production process.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

But, if you insist on an answer, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to choose, it would be a question that is not available.

Although Question 4 does not directly ask about the amount of water saved by decreasing laundry loads, it does ask about the estimated amount of water needed to produce the average t-shirt, which is related to the water usage mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the water usage in laundry loads, but such a question is not present among the provided options. Therefore, based on the available options, Question 4 is the closest match.

However, if we were to recreate a question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely, it would look something like this:

Question: If you decreased the amount of laundry loads in your household to 100 less than the average, and the average household does nearly 400 loads of laundry per year, each using about 40 gallons of water, how much water would you save per year?
Options: A. 2000 gallons, B. 4000 gallons, C. 200 gallons, D. 400 gallons 

This recreated question takes into account the information provided in the transcript about the average household's laundry loads and water usage per load.

But since this is not among the options, the closest match is:

 Question 4

**Transcript**:
"Beauty is a curse," Psyche thought as she looked over the cliff's edge
where she'd been abandoned by her father. She'd been born with the physical
perfection so complete that she was worshipped as a new
incarnation of Venus, the goddess of love. But real-life human lovers were
too intimidated even to approach her. When her father asked for guidance
from the Oracle of Apollo, the god of light, reason, and prophecy. He was told to abandon his daughter
on a rocky crag where she would marry a cruel
and savage serpent-like winged evil. Alone on the crag, Psyche felt
Zephyr the West Wind gently lifting her into the air. It set her down before a palace. "You are home," she heard 
an unseen voice say. "Your husband awaits you
in the bedroom, if you dare to meet him." She was brave enough, Psyche told herself. The bedroom was so dark that she
couldn't see her husband. But he didn't feel serpent-like at all. His skin was soft,
and his voice and manner were gentle. She asked him who he was, but he told her this was the one question
he could never answer. If she loved him, 
she would not need to know. His visits continued night after night. Before long, Psyche was pregnant. She rejoiced, but was also conflicted. How could she raise her baby
with a man she'd never seen? That night, Psyche approached
her sleeping husband holding an oil lamp. What she found was the god Cupid who sent gods and humans 
lusting after each other with the pinpricks of his arrows. Psyche dropped her lamp,
burning Cupid with hot oil. He said he'd been in love with Psyche
ever since his jealous mother, Venus, asked him to embarrass the young woman
by pricking her with an arrow. But taken with Psyche's beauty, Cupid
used the arrow on himself. He didn't believe, however, that gods
and humans could love as equals. Now that she knew his true form,
their hopes for happiness were dashed, so he flew away. Psyche was left in despair until
the unseen voice returned and told her that it was indeed possible for her and Cupid 
to love each other as equals. Encouraged, she set out to find him. But Venus intercepted Psyche and said
she and Cupid could only wed if she completed a series 
of impossible tasks. First, Psyche was told to sort a huge,
messy pile of seeds in a single night. Just as she was abandoning hope, an ant colony took pity on her
and helped with the work. Successfully passing the first trial, Psyche next had to bring Venus
the fleece of the golden sheep, who had a reputation for 
disemboweling stray adventurers, but a river god showed her how to collect the fleece the sheep 
had snagged on briars, and she succeeded. Finally, Psyche had to travel
to the Underworld and convince Proserpina, 
queen of the dead, to put a drop of her beauty in a box
for Venus. Once again, the unseen voice came
to Psyche's aide. It told her to bring barley cakes for
Cerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld and coins to pay the boatman, Charon
to ferry her across the river Styx. With her third and final task complete, Psyche returned to the land of the living. Just outside Venus's palace, she opened
the box of Proserpina's beauty, hoping to keep some for herself. But the box was filled with sleep,
not beauty, and Psyche collapsed in the road. Cupid, now recovered from his wounds,
flew to his sleeping bride. He told her he'd been wrong and foolish. Her fearlessness in the face
of the unknown proved that she was more than his equal. Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar
of the gods, making her immortal. Shortly after, Psyche bore their daughter. They named her Pleasure, and she, Cupid, and Psyche, 
whose name means soul, have been complicating people's
love lives ever since.

**Transcript**:
"Beauty is a curse," Psyche thought as she looked over the cliff's edge
where she'd been abandoned by her father. She'd been born with the physical
perfection so complete that she was worshipped as a new
incarnation of Venus, the goddess of love. But real-life human lovers were
too intimidated even to approach her. When her father asked for guidance
from the Oracle of Apollo, the god of light, reason, and prophecy. He was told to abandon his daughter
on a rocky crag where she would marry a cruel
and savage serpent-like winged evil. Alone on the crag, Psyche felt
Zephyr the West Wind gently lifting her into the air. It set her down before a palace. "You are home," she heard 
an unseen voice say. "Your husband awaits you
in the bedroom, if you dare to meet him." She was brave enough, Psyche told herself. The bedroom was so dark that she
couldn't see her husband. But he didn't feel serpent-like at all. His skin was soft,
and his voice and manner were gentle. She asked him who he was, but he told her this was the one question
he could never answer. If she loved him, 
she would not need to know. His visits continued night after night. Before long, Psyche was pregnant. She rejoiced, but was also conflicted. How could she raise her baby
with a man she'd never seen? That night, Psyche approached
her sleeping husband holding an oil lamp. What she found was the god Cupid who sent gods and humans 
lusting after each other with the pinpricks of his arrows. Psyche dropped her lamp,
burning Cupid with hot oil. He said he'd been in love with Psyche
ever since his jealous mother, Venus, asked him to embarrass the young woman
by pricking her with an arrow. But taken with Psyche's beauty, Cupid
used the arrow on himself. He didn't believe, however, that gods
and humans could love as equals. Now that she knew his true form,
their hopes for happiness were dashed, so he flew away. Psyche was left in despair until
the unseen voice returned and told her that it was indeed possible for her and Cupid 
to love each other as equals. Encouraged, she set out to find him. But Venus intercepted Psyche and said
she and Cupid could only wed if she completed a series 
of impossible tasks. First, Psyche was told to sort a huge,
messy pile of seeds in a single night. Just as she was abandoning hope, an ant colony took pity on her
and helped with the work. Successfully passing the first trial, Psyche next had to bring Venus
the fleece of the golden sheep, who had a reputation for 
disemboweling stray adventurers, but a river god showed her how to collect the fleece the sheep 
had snagged on briars, and she succeeded. Finally, Psyche had to travel
to the Underworld and convince Proserpina, 
queen of the dead, to put a drop of her beauty in a box
for Venus. Once again, the unseen voice came
to Psyche's aide. It told her to bring barley cakes for
Cerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld and coins to pay the boatman, Charon
to ferry her across the river Styx. With her third and final task complete, Psyche returned to the land of the living. Just outside Venus's palace, she opened
the box of Proserpina's beauty, hoping to keep some for herself. But the box was filled with sleep,
not beauty, and Psyche collapsed in the road. Cupid, now recovered from his wounds,
flew to his sleeping bride. He told her he'd been wrong and foolish. Her fearlessness in the face
of the unknown proved that she was more than his equal. Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar
of the gods, making her immortal. Shortly after, Psyche bore their daughter. They named her Pleasure, and she, Cupid, and Psyche, 
whose name means soul, have been complicating people's
love lives ever since.

**Transcript**:
Behold the human brain, it's lumpy landscape visibly split into
a left and right side. This structure has inspired one of 
the most pervasive ideas about the brain, that the left side controls logic and the right, creativity. And yet, this is a myth unsupported
by scientific evidence. So how did this misleading idea
come about, and what does it get wrong? It's true that the brain has a right
and a left side. This is most apparent 
with the outer layer, or the cortex. Internal regions, like the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue, but in fact, they're also organized
with left and right sides. The left and the right sides of the brain
do control different body functions, such as movement and sight. The brain's right side controls the motion
of the left arm and leg and vice versa. The visual system is even more complex. Each eye has a left 
and right visual field. Both left visual fields are sent
to the right side of the brain, and both right fields 
are sent to the left side. So the brain uses both sides to make
a complete image of the world. Scientists don't know for sure
why we have that crossing over. One theory is it began soon after animals
developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage
of quicker reflexes. If an animal sees a predator coming
from its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. So we can say that vision 
and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend
that idea to logic and creativity. This misconception began in 
the mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems
communicating due to injuries. The researchers found damage to
the patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is
controlled by the left side of the brain. That captured the popular imagination. Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea 
of a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional 
right hemisphere represented by his characters
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But this idea didn't hold up when doctors
and scientists examined patients who were missing
a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. These patients showed a complete
range of behaviors, both logical and creative. Later research showed that one side
of the brain is more active than the other for some functions. Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system
rather than by person. There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant 
sides of the brain, or to support the idea 
of a left-right split between logic and creativity. Some people may be particularly logical
or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides
of their brains. And even the idea of logic and creativity
being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. Solving complex math problems requires
inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art
have intricate logical frameworks. Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain
functioning as one.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly addresses the relationship between the brain's right side and motor control.

A question that more closely matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ is not present among the provided options. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content, I would choose:

None of the questions perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 7 is the closest in terms of discussing the relationship between the left and right sides and motor control, although it does so in a more indirect way.

However, since it is not a perfect match I will try to look for another option that can be a match.

Another option can be 
Question 3, it does discuss a specific function of a side of the brain. However, I will need to make a small edit in the question to make it match.

If we edit Question 3:  A patient with damage to the "right" temporal lobe is likely to experience difficulties with which cognitive function? Options: A. Movement control of the right arm, B. Movement control of the left arm, C. Language, D. Attention 

Then this question will be the best match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, this is an edited question. Among the original questions the best match will be Question 7

a complete image of the world. Scientists don't know for sure
why we have that crossing over. One theory is it began soon after animals
developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage
of quicker reflexes. If an animal sees a predator coming
from its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. So we can say that vision 
and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend
that idea to logic and creativity. This misconception began in 
the mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems
communicating due to injuries. The researchers found damage to
the patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is
controlled by the left side of the brain. That captured the popular imagination. Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea 
of a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional 
right hemisphere represented by his characters
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But this idea didn't hold up when doctors
and scientists examined patients who were missing
a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. These patients showed a complete
range of behaviors, both logical and creative. Later research showed that one side
of the brain is more active than the other for some functions. Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system
rather than by person. There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant 
sides of the brain, or to support the idea 
of a left-right split between logic and creativity. Some people may be particularly logical
or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides
of their brains. And even the idea of logic and creativity
being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. Solving complex math problems requires
inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art
have intricate logical frameworks. Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain
functioning as one.

**Transcript**:
Over 100,000 metric tons
of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight
of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed
in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,
focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,
and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where
it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves
and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,
as it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember
and revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a
stimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of
the body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply
of energy, which it gets by breaking down
a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,
ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors
perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade 
of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important
brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine
receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process
of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar
molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into
the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, 
adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,
so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors 
for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain
is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these
paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine
to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,
it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects
on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,
reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's
ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes 
an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below
a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects
are so helpful. It might make you feel better
and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate
and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages
caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body
that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular
consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors 
are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job
of signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need
to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine
receptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly 
quit caffeine, you may experience 
an unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors 
and no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine
receptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's
most popular stimulant.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 6 does not match the exact intent of the ground truth MCQ, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the effects of caffeine consumption and which option is not a manifestation of it.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, as it talks about the effects of caffeine consumption, but it does not match the exact intent of the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that asks about the effects of caffeine consumption and which option is not a manifestation of it, with options that include the effects mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (e.g., probable weight reduction, reduced risk of Parkinson's disease, raised heart rate and blood pressure, and hydration of the human body).

Given the available generated MCQs, I would say that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 7 is the closest.

for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain
is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these
paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine
to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,
it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects
on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,
reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's
ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes 
an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below
a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects
are so helpful. It might make you feel better
and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate
and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages
caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body
that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular
consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors 
are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job
of signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need
to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine
receptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly 
quit caffeine, you may experience 
an unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors 
and no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine
receptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's
most popular stimulant.

**Transcript**:
Over 100,000 metric tons
of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight
of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed
in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,
focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,
and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where
it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves
and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,
as it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember
and revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a
stimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of
the body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply
of energy, which it gets by breaking down
a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,
ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors
perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade 
of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important
brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine
receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process
of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar
molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into
the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, 
adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,
so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors 
for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain
is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these
paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine
to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,
it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects

**Transcript**:
A toothpaste brand claims
their product will destroy more plaque than any product ever made. A politician tells you their plan
will create the most jobs. We're so used to hearing these
kinds of exaggerations in advertising and politics that we might not even bat an eye. But what about when the claim
is accompanied by a graph? Afterall, a graph isn't an opinion. It represents cold, hard numbers,
and who can argue with those? Yet, as it turns out, there are plenty
of ways graphs can mislead and outright manipulate. Here are some things to look out for. In this 1992 ad, Chevy claimed to make
the most reliable trucks in America using this graph. Not only does it show that 98% of all
Chevy trucks sold in the last ten years are still on the road, but it looks like they're twice
as dependable as Toyota trucks. That is, until you take a closer look
at the numbers on the left and see that the figure for Toyota
is about 96.5%. The scale only goes between 95 and 100%. If it went from 0 to 100,
it would look like this. This is one of the most common
ways graphs misrepresent data, by distorting the scale. Zooming in on a small portion
of the y-axis exaggerates a barely detectable difference
between the things being compared. And it's especially misleading 
with bar graphs since we assume the difference
in the size of the bars is proportional to the values. But the scale can also be distorted
along the x-axis, usually in line graphs
showing something changing over time. This chart showing the rise
in American unemployment from 2008 to 2010 manipulates the x-axis in two ways. First of all, the scale is inconsistent, compressing the 15-month span
after March 2009 to look shorter than 
the preceding six months. Using more consistent data points
gives a different picture with job losses tapering off
by the end of 2009. And if you wonder why
they were increasing in the first place, the timeline starts immediately after
the U.S.'s biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. These techniques are known as
cherry picking. A time range can be carefully chosen
to exclude the impact of a major event right outside it. And picking specific data points
can hide important changes in between. Even when there's nothing wrong
with the graph itself, leaving out relevant data can give
a misleading impression. This chart of how many people watch
the Super Bowl each year makes it look like the event's
popularity is exploding. But it's not accounting 
for population growth. The ratings have actually held steady because while the number 
of football fans has increased, their share of overall viewership has not. Finally, a graph can't tell you much if you don't know the full significance 
of what's being presented. Both of the following graphs
use the same ocean temperature data from the National Centers 
for Environmental Information. So why do they seem to give
opposite impressions? The first graph plots the average
annual ocean temperature from 1880 to 2016, making the change look insignificant. But in fact, a rise of even
half a degree Celsius can cause massive ecological disruption. This is why the second graph, which show the average temperature
variation each year, is far more significant. When they're used well, graphs can
help us intuitively grasp complex data. But as visual software has enabled
more usage of graphs throughout all media, it's also made them easier to use
in a careless or dishonest way. So the next time you see a graph,
don't be swayed by the lines and curves. Look at the labels, the numbers, the scale, and the context, and ask what story the picture
is trying to tell.

by the end of 2009. And if you wonder why
they were increasing in the first place, the timeline starts immediately after
the U.S.'s biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. These techniques are known as
cherry picking. A time range can be carefully chosen
to exclude the impact of a major event right outside it. And picking specific data points
can hide important changes in between. Even when there's nothing wrong
with the graph itself, leaving out relevant data can give
a misleading impression. This chart of how many people watch
the Super Bowl each year makes it look like the event's
popularity is exploding. But it's not accounting 
for population growth. The ratings have actually held steady because while the number 
of football fans has increased, their share of overall viewership has not. Finally, a graph can't tell you much if you don't know the full significance 
of what's being presented. Both of the following graphs
use the same ocean temperature data from the National Centers 
for Environmental Information. So why do they seem to give
opposite impressions? The first graph plots the average
annual ocean temperature from 1880 to 2016, making the change look insignificant. But in fact, a rise of even
half a degree Celsius can cause massive ecological disruption. This is why the second graph, which show the average temperature
variation each year, is far more significant. When they're used well, graphs can
help us intuitively grasp complex data. But as visual software has enabled
more usage of graphs throughout all media, it's also made them easier to use
in a careless or dishonest way. So the next time you see a graph,
don't be swayed by the lines and curves. Look at the labels, the numbers, the scale, and the context, and ask what story the picture
is trying to tell.

**Transcript**:
A toothpaste brand claims
their product will destroy more plaque than any product ever made. A politician tells you their plan
will create the most jobs. We're so used to hearing these
kinds of exaggerations in advertising and politics that we might not even bat an eye. But what about when the claim
is accompanied by a graph? Afterall, a graph isn't an opinion. It represents cold, hard numbers,
and who can argue with those? Yet, as it turns out, there are plenty
of ways graphs can mislead and outright manipulate. Here are some things to look out for. In this 1992 ad, Chevy claimed to make
the most reliable trucks in America using this graph. Not only does it show that 98% of all
Chevy trucks sold in the last ten years are still on the road, but it looks like they're twice
as dependable as Toyota trucks. That is, until you take a closer look
at the numbers on the left and see that the figure for Toyota
is about 96.5%. The scale only goes between 95 and 100%. If it went from 0 to 100,
it would look like this. This is one of the most common
ways graphs misrepresent data, by distorting the scale. Zooming in on a small portion
of the y-axis exaggerates a barely detectable difference
between the things being compared. And it's especially misleading 
with bar graphs since we assume the difference
in the size of the bars is proportional to the values. But the scale can also be distorted
along the x-axis, usually in line graphs
showing something changing over time. This chart showing the rise
in American unemployment from 2008 to 2010 manipulates the x-axis in two ways. First of all, the scale is inconsistent, compressing the 15-month span
after March 2009 to look shorter than 
the preceding six months. Using more consistent data points
gives a different picture with job losses tapering off
by the end of 2009. And if you wonder why
they were increasing in the first place, the timeline starts immediately after
the U.S.'s biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. These techniques are known as
cherry picking. A time range can be carefully chosen
to exclude the impact of a major event right outside it. And picking specific data points
can hide important changes in between. Even when there's nothing wrong
with the graph itself, leaving out relevant data can give
a misleading impression. This chart of how many people watch

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

This question is about a company claiming their product is more reliable than their competitor's, using a graph to support their claim, but the scale only goes from 95 to 100%. This scenario is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which discusses the graph that presents data on truck reliability, with a scale that only goes from 95 to 100%. 

The issue with the graph in both questions is that the scale is too narrow, which can mislead the viewer into thinking there is a larger difference in reliability between the products than there actually is. 

While the options in Question 8 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are similar, making it the most closely matched generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The biggest kidney stone on record
weighed more than a kilogram and was 17 centimeters in diameter. The patient didn't actually
swallow a stone the size of a coconut. Kidney stones form inside the body, but unfortunately, they're extremely
painful to get out. A kidney stone is a hard mass
of crystals that can form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine contains compounds 
that consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, oxalate, uric acid, and phosphate. If the levels of these particles
get too high, or if urine becomes too acidic
or basic, the particles can clump together
and crystallize. Unless the problem is addressed, the crystals will gradually grow
over a few weeks, months, or even years, forming a detectable stone. Calcium oxalate is the most common
type of crystal to form this way, and accounts for about 
80% of kidney stones. Less common kidney stones are made
of calcium phosphate, or uric acid. A slightly different type of stone made of the minerals magnesium
ammonium phosphate, or struvite, can be caused by bacterial infection. And even rarer stones can result
from genetic disorders or certain medications. A kidney stone can go undetected
until it starts to move. When a stone travels
through the kidney and into the ureter, its sharp edges scratch
the walls of the urinary tract. Nerve endings embedded in this tissue
transmit excruciating pain signals through the nervous system. And the scratches can send blood flowing
into the urine. This can be accompanied 
by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough
to actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection,
or back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones 
don't become this serious, or even require invasive treatment. Masses less than five millimeters
in diameter will usually pass out 
of the body on their own. A doctor will often simply recommend
drinking large amounts of water to help speed the process along, and maybe taking some pain killers. If the stone is slightly larger,
medications like alpha blockers can help by relaxing the muscles
in the ureter and making it easier 
for the stone to get through. Another medication called
potassium citrate can help dissolve the stones by creating
a less acidic urine. For medium-sized stones up to about
ten millimeters, one option is pulverizing them
with soundwaves. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
uses high-intensity pulses of focused ultrasonic energy
aimed directly at the stone. The pulses create vibrations inside
the stone itself and small bubbles jostle it. These combined forces crush the stone
into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body more easily. But zapping a stone with sound
doesn't work as well if it's simply too big. So sometimes, more invasive
treatments are necessary. A rigid tube called a stent
can be placed in the ureter to expand it. Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses
to break up the stone. Stones can also be surgically removed
through an incision in the patient's back or groin. What about just avoiding kidney stones
in the first place? For people prone to them, their doctor may recommend
drinking plenty of water, which dilutes the calcium oxalate
and other compounds that eventually build up 
into painful stones. Foods like potato chips, spinach, rhubarb, and beets are high in oxalate, so doctors might advise limiting them. Even though calcium 
is often found in stones, calcium in foods and beverages
can actually help by binding to oxalate 
in the digestive tract before it can be absorbed
and reach the kidneys. If you do end up with a kidney stone,
you're not alone. Data suggests that rates are rising, but that world record probably
won't be broken any time soon.

by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough
to actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection,
or back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones 
don't become this serious, or even require invasive treatment. Masses less than five millimeters
in diameter will usually pass out 
of the body on their own. A doctor will often simply recommend
drinking large amounts of water to help speed the process along, and maybe taking some pain killers. If the stone is slightly larger,
medications like alpha blockers can help by relaxing the muscles
in the ureter and making it easier 
for the stone to get through. Another medication called
potassium citrate can help dissolve the stones by creating
a less acidic urine. For medium-sized stones up to about
ten millimeters, one option is pulverizing them
with soundwaves. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
uses high-intensity pulses of focused ultrasonic energy
aimed directly at the stone. The pulses create vibrations inside
the stone itself and small bubbles jostle it. These combined forces crush the stone
into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body more easily. But zapping a stone with sound
doesn't work as well if it's simply too big. So sometimes, more invasive
treatments are necessary. A rigid tube called a stent
can be placed in the ureter to expand it. Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses
to break up the stone. Stones can also be surgically removed
through an incision in the patient's back or groin. What about just avoiding kidney stones
in the first place? For people prone to them, their doctor may recommend
drinking plenty of water, which dilutes the calcium oxalate
and other compounds that eventually build up 
into painful stones. Foods like potato chips, spinach, rhubarb, and beets are high in oxalate, so doctors might advise limiting them. Even though calcium 
is often found in stones, calcium in foods and beverages
can actually help by binding to oxalate 
in the digestive tract before it can be absorbed
and reach the kidneys. If you do end up with a kidney stone,
you're not alone. Data suggests that rates are rising, but that world record probably
won't be broken any time soon.

**Transcript**:
The biggest kidney stone on record
weighed more than a kilogram and was 17 centimeters in diameter. The patient didn't actually
swallow a stone the size of a coconut. Kidney stones form inside the body, but unfortunately, they're extremely
painful to get out. A kidney stone is a hard mass
of crystals that can form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine contains compounds 
that consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, oxalate, uric acid, and phosphate. If the levels of these particles
get too high, or if urine becomes too acidic
or basic, the particles can clump together
and crystallize. Unless the problem is addressed, the crystals will gradually grow
over a few weeks, months, or even years, forming a detectable stone. Calcium oxalate is the most common
type of crystal to form this way, and accounts for about 
80% of kidney stones. Less common kidney stones are made
of calcium phosphate, or uric acid. A slightly different type of stone made of the minerals magnesium
ammonium phosphate, or struvite, can be caused by bacterial infection. And even rarer stones can result
from genetic disorders or certain medications. A kidney stone can go undetected
until it starts to move. When a stone travels
through the kidney and into the ureter, its sharp edges scratch
the walls of the urinary tract. Nerve endings embedded in this tissue
transmit excruciating pain signals through the nervous system. And the scratches can send blood flowing
into the urine. This can be accompanied 
by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough
to actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection,
or back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ in terms of the consequences of a kidney stone. However, it does not directly address when the stones cause pain.

A more relevant question that addresses the pain caused by kidney stones is not present among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the movement of kidney stones, I would choose Question 10, which discusses the relationship between the size of a kidney stone and the treatment options available, including the fact that small stones can pass on their own, which might be related to the movement of stones.

However, if I had to choose one that is most similar in terms of the intent of the question (i.e., the pain caused by kidney stones), I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:
 Question 10

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the "best treatment for small size" kidney stones, the most similar generated MCQ (Question 9) focuses on preventive measures, which include drinking plenty of water and limiting foods high in oxalate. These measures are also mentioned in the correct option (D) of the ground truth MCQ as "Fluid intake and dietary modification." 

However, if we consider the treatment aspect, Question 3 and Question 10 also discuss the relationship between kidney stone size and treatment options. But they do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, based on the available options, I would recommend Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with the understanding that there might be some differences in the question's intent.

**Transcript**:
This is a 20-minute VHS tape about a LEGO
character called Jack Stone. When it came out in 2001, it was the first
real computer-animated Lego movie. … but it hasn’t aged that well. "Incredible!" "Fantastic." Thirteen years later, The Lego Movie looked
like this: Let’s watch that again. This is 2001. "There you have it." And this is 2014. "Yes, that's me." That is a huge difference. Here’s how they made it happen. “My name is Grant Freckelton, I’m a production
designer at Animal Logic.” He’s overseen the animation style of movies
like Legend of the Guardians, 300, and more recently, The Lego Movie, with co-directors
Chris Miller and Phil Lord. “Chris and Phil were determined to sort
of make sure the audience was confused about what they were seeing. You know is it actually stop motion, or is
it CG film?” And that became a big debate. Before the movie came out, there was a lot
of conversation about whether the movie was stop motion or computer animation. "It is, I would say 99% CG animation, but
it respects the rules of stop motion animation, and is designed to emulate that style.” To understand what made that style so unique,
you have to look back at what Lego movies used to look like. Early productions for themes like Bionicle,
Star Wars, and Batman helped establish the whimsical feel of Lego movies — but the
animation didn’t fit the physics of the toy itself. “There was this tendency to sort of treat
the plastic like it was flexible rubber, which meant that the characters could flex and move
a lot more than they might be able to in real life.” That style is typical of more traditional
computer animation, like what you’d expect to see in a Pixar movie. Take a shot like this, for example. The background isn’t made of actual blocks,
plastic limbs are bending in ways they couldn’t, and the faces are a bizarre blend of skin-like
texture and Lego geometry. It doesn’t look like a scene you could make
at home with your own Legos. Compare that to scenes from The Lego Movie,
where everything — gunshots, smoke, water, fire, explosions, clouds, even mud on the camera
lens — are all made up of Lego pieces as they look in real life. “We respected the hardness of the plastic
by not necessarily bending on the elbow, which you can’t do on a real Lego minifig.” That means that any movement you see onscreen
simulates the adjustment or replacement of an individual Lego piece. A joint or facial expression will never actually
bend or stretch — it’ll either move slightly or be replaced by another piece. Early Lego movies lacked that level of discipline. They struggled because they fought back against the limitations of the medium instead of embracing them. But the creators of the Lego Movie saw things
differently. “Characters that have limitations force you
to find solutions and charming ways of doing things in different ways. I mean, look at R2-D2: he’s like, the ultimate
limited character, he’s basically a bin with wheels that makes beeping noises, and
that’s all he's got to work with. And yet he’s a really charming character and everybody loves him. Same with BB-8. And other characters. Same with the Muppets, they’re essentially sock puppets with googly eyes that you don't really have much control over. But it’s from those limitations that you actually get a lot of charm.” Every now and then, the Lego movie animators
would let some joints overextend slightly to make room for a nod or a shrug of the shoulders... But overall, sticking to the plastic rule
made for a believable movie. You can freeze frame any part of the Lego
Movie and look at a scene that you could practically make at home. “We were always trying to echo and hark
back to how a child might make a film. So we would alternate between thinking like
responsible filmmakers working on a large-budget Warner Brothers animated film, and then we
would suddenly approach a scene as if we were like a kid animating in their basement.” But the history of Lego movies actually does start
with kids animating in their basements. In 1973, two Danish cousins, aged 10 and 12,
shot a short film called Journey to the Moon on Super 8 film. They made it for their grandparents’ 50th
wedding anniversary — and it’s widely considered to be the first time anyone made
a motion picture with Lego blocks. Note that the “people” in this film are
just little cylinder blocks — this was before any version of the minifigure design came
out. Movies like this came to be known as “Brickfilms.” When fans were making these at home, they
shot them in traditional stop motion. Footage was usually shot “on twos,” which
meant that they would take 12 pictures — adjusting the characters every other frame — to make
one second of film. Shooting “on ones” meant taking 24 pictures
per second — this was usually reserved for making faster movements like running look
smoother. When the Danish cousins sent their movie to
the managing director of the Lego Group, they were rewarded with a tour of the Lego factory
and sent home with large Lego sets. But Lego hasn’t always had the most positive
reaction to homemade fan films like this one. Between 1985 and 1989, a teenage animator
named Lindsay Fleay worked on a 16-minute short called The Magic Portal. He used borrowed equipment to shoot it in
his parents’ basement. Before entering festivals and competitions,
Fleay sent the film to Lego to see if they were interested in doing something with it. At first, Lego responded with a letter of
approval. But soon, the company started expressing legal
concerns and issued a letter demanding Fleay surrender all copies of the film within seven
days. Lego ultimately backed down, but Fleay had
already missed out on most major film festivals by then. Fleay actually went on to work at Animal Logic. He left before production on Lego projects
began, but his movie had a huge influence on the world of Brickfilms. “If you look at the live action portion
of The Lego Movie, you'll see Finn, the little kid, holds up a sort of cardboard  tube and across the side is written Magic Portal." The Lego Movie, of course, was a huge technical
feat. There are 15,080,330 animated Lego pieces and 182 unique minifigures in the movie. Early mockups of buildings and vehicles were drafted on a free software called Lego Digital Designer Later on, in the animation software Maya,
each brick was given profiles for fingerprints, dents, seam lines, scratches, and dust. It’s hard to imagine what The Lego Movie
would be if it weren’t for the legacy of these early home experiments. Where most animated films use soft lighting
modeled after paintings, The Lego Movie’s lighting was harsh, replicating the actual
lamps that animators like Fleay used. Playful non-stop motion interludes — like
levitation via fishing line — were part of Journey to the Moon long before they appeared
in The Lego Movie. Even the final break from the Lego world into
the real world to meet a human creator parallels The Magic Portal really closely. Ah, my film! It’s easy to miss on-screen, but The Lego
Movie pays tribute to fan films in the background of this scene — these four clips are shorts
submitted by fans. “Look at all these things that people built!” The homage was a nod to the fans. By doing that, the movie embraced the idea
that amateur creators matter — and sometimes, the way they handle source material is far
better than the way major studios are used to doing it. If you want to try any of this at home, you
can actually use the same software that the animators of The Lego Movie used. It’s called Lego Digital Designer, it’s
totally free off the internet. When I talked to Grant Freckelton, he challenged
me to make this sort of pig-drawn carriage. I tried. I got the pigs, I got the wheels, but not
much else. It’s very, very difficult.

**Transcript**:
This is a 20-minute VHS tape about a LEGO
character called Jack Stone. When it came out in 2001, it was the first
real computer-animated Lego movie. … but it hasn’t aged that well. "Incredible!" "Fantastic." Thirteen years later, The Lego Movie looked
like this: Let’s watch that again. This is 2001. "There you have it." And this is 2014. "Yes, that's me." That is a huge difference. Here’s how they made it happen. “My name is Grant Freckelton, I’m a production
designer at Animal Logic.” He’s overseen the animation style of movies
like Legend of the Guardians, 300, and more recently, The Lego Movie, with co-directors
Chris Miller and Phil Lord. “Chris and Phil were determined to sort
of make sure the audience was confused about what they were seeing. You know is it actually stop motion, or is
it CG film?” And that became a big debate. Before the movie came out, there was a lot
of conversation about whether the movie was stop motion or computer animation. "It is, I would say 99% CG animation, but
it respects the rules of stop motion animation, and is designed to emulate that style.” To understand what made that style so unique,
you have to look back at what Lego movies used to look like. Early productions for themes like Bionicle,
Star Wars, and Batman helped establish the whimsical feel of Lego movies — but the
animation didn’t fit the physics of the toy itself. “There was this tendency to sort of treat
the plastic like it was flexible rubber, which meant that the characters could flex and move
a lot more than they might be able to in real life.” That style is typical of more traditional
computer animation, like what you’d expect to see in a Pixar movie. Take a shot like this, for example. The background isn’t made of actual blocks,
plastic limbs are bending in ways they couldn’t, and the faces are a bizarre blend of skin-like
texture and Lego geometry. It doesn’t look like a scene you could make
at home with your own Legos. Compare that to scenes from The Lego Movie,
where everything — gunshots, smoke, water, fire, explosions, clouds, even mud on the camera
lens — are all made up of Lego pieces as they look in real life. “We respected the hardness of the plastic
by not necessarily bending on the elbow, which you can’t do on a real Lego minifig.” That means that any movement you see onscreen
simulates the adjustment or replacement of an individual Lego piece. A joint or facial expression will never actually
bend or stretch — it’ll either move slightly or be replaced by another piece. Early Lego movies lacked that level of discipline. They struggled because they fought back against the limitations of the medium instead of embracing them. But the creators of the Lego Movie saw things
differently. “Characters that have limitations force you
to find solutions and charming ways of doing things in different ways. I mean, look at R2-D2: he’s like, the ultimate
limited character, he’s basically a bin with wheels that makes beeping noises, and
that’s all he's got to work with. And yet he’s a really charming character and everybody loves him. Same with BB-8. And other characters.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with the concept of shooting "on twos" or "on ones" in the context of stop motion animation. However, it does not directly ask which method requires more pictures.

A more direct match would be a question that specifically asks about the difference in the number of pictures taken between "shooting on twos" and "shooting on ones". Unfortunately, such a question is not present in the generated MCQs.

This is a crystal of sugar. If you press on it, it will actually
generate its own electricity. How can this simple crystal 
act like a tiny power source? Because sugar is piezoelectric. Piezoelectric materials 
turn mechanical stress, like pressure, sound waves, and other vibrations into electricity and vice versa. This odd phenomenon was first
discovered by the physicist Pierre Curie 
and his brother Jacques in 1880. They discovered that if they compressed
thin slices of certain crystals, positive and negative charges would appear
on opposite faces. This difference in charge, or voltage, meant that the compressed crystal
could drive current through a circuit, like a battery. And it worked the other way around, too. Running electricity through these crystals
made them change shape. Both of these results, turning mechanical energy into electrical, and electrical energy into mechanical, were remarkable. But the discovery went uncelebrated
for several decades. The first practical application
was in sonar instruments used to detect German submarines
during World War I. Piezoelectric quartz crystals 
in the sonar's transmitter vibrated when they were subjected
to alternating voltage. That sent ultrasound waves
through the water. Measuring how long it took these waves
to bounce back from an object revealed how far away it was. For the opposite transformation, converting mechanical energy 
to electrical, consider the lights that turn on
when you clap. Clapping your hands send sound vibrations
through the air and causes the piezo element to bend
back and forth. This creates a voltage that can drive
enough current to light up the LEDs, though it's conventional sources 
of electricity that keep them on. So what makes a material piezoelectric? The answer depends on two factors: the materials atomic structure, and how electric charge
is distributed within it. Many materials are crystalline, meaning they're made of atoms or ions arranged in an orderly 
three-dimensional pattern. That pattern has a building block
called a unit cell that repeats over and over. In most non-piezoelectric 
crystalline materials, the atoms in their unit cells
are distributed symmetrically around a central point. But some crystalline materials
don't possess a center of symmetry making them candidates 
for piezoelectricity. Let's look at quartz, a piezoelectric material 
made of silicon and oxygen. The oxygens have a slight negative charge
and silicons have a slight positive, creating a separation of charge, or a dipole along each bond. Normally, these dipoles 
cancel each other out, so there's no net separation of charge
in the unit cell. But if a quartz crystal is squeezed
along a certain direction, the atoms shift. Because of the resulting asymmetry
in charge distribution, the dipoles no longer cancel
each other out. The stretched cell ends up
with a net negative charge on one side and a net positive on the other. This charge imbalance is repeated
all the way through the material, and opposite charges collect
on opposite faces of the crystal. This results in a voltage that can
drive electricity through a circuit. Piezoelectric materials can 
have different structures. But what they all have in common is unit
cells which lack a center of symmetry. And the stronger the compression
on piezoelectric materials, the larger the voltage generated. Stretch the crystal, instead,
and the voltage will switch, making current flow the other way. More materials are piezoelectric
than you might think. DNA, bone, and silk all have this ability to turn
mechanical energy into electrical. Scientists have created a variety
of synthetic piezoelectric materials and found applications for them
in everything from medical imaging to ink jet printers. Piezoelectricity is responsible for 
the rhythmic oscillations of the quartz crystals
that keep watches running on time, the speakers of musical birthday cards, and the spark that ignites the gas 
in some barbecue grill lighters when you flick the switch. And piezoelectric devices may become
even more common since electricity is in high demand
and mechanical energy is abundant. There are already train stations
that use passengers' footsteps to power the ticket gates and displays and a dance club where piezoelectricity
helps power the lights. Could basketball players running back
and forth power the scoreboard? Or might walking down the street
charge your electronic devices? What's next for piezoelectricity?

in charge distribution, the dipoles no longer cancel
each other out. The stretched cell ends up
with a net negative charge on one side and a net positive on the other. This charge imbalance is repeated
all the way through the material, and opposite charges collect
on opposite faces of the crystal. This results in a voltage that can
drive electricity through a circuit. Piezoelectric materials can 
have different structures. But what they all have in common is unit
cells which lack a center of symmetry. And the stronger the compression
on piezoelectric materials, the larger the voltage generated. Stretch the crystal, instead,
and the voltage will switch, making current flow the other way. More materials are piezoelectric
than you might think. DNA, bone, and silk all have this ability to turn
mechanical energy into electrical. Scientists have created a variety
of synthetic piezoelectric materials and found applications for them
in everything from medical imaging to ink jet printers. Piezoelectricity is responsible for 
the rhythmic oscillations of the quartz crystals
that keep watches running on time, the speakers of musical birthday cards, and the spark that ignites the gas

even more common since electricity is in high demand

**Transcript**:
This is a crystal of sugar. If you press on it, it will actually
generate its own electricity. How can this simple crystal 
act like a tiny power source? Because sugar is piezoelectric. Piezoelectric materials 
turn mechanical stress, like pressure, sound waves, and other vibrations into electricity and vice versa. This odd phenomenon was first
discovered by the physicist Pierre Curie 
and his brother Jacques in 1880. They discovered that if they compressed
thin slices of certain crystals, positive and negative charges would appear
on opposite faces. This difference in charge, or voltage, meant that the compressed crystal
could drive current through a circuit, like a battery. And it worked the other way around, too. Running electricity through these crystals
made them change shape. Both of these results, turning mechanical energy into electrical, and electrical energy into mechanical, were remarkable. But the discovery went uncelebrated
for several decades. The first practical application
was in sonar instruments used to detect German submarines
during World War I. Piezoelectric quartz crystals 
in the sonar's transmitter vibrated when they were subjected
to alternating voltage. That sent ultrasound waves
through the water. Measuring how long it took these waves
to bounce back from an object revealed how far away it was. For the opposite transformation, converting mechanical energy 
to electrical, consider the lights that turn on
when you clap. Clapping your hands send sound vibrations
through the air and causes the piezo element to bend
back and forth. This creates a voltage that can drive
enough current to light up the LEDs, though it's conventional sources 
of electricity that keep them on. So what makes a material piezoelectric? The answer depends on two factors: the materials atomic structure, and how electric charge
is distributed within it. Many materials are crystalline, meaning they're made of atoms or ions arranged in an orderly 
three-dimensional pattern. That pattern has a building block
called a unit cell that repeats over and over. In most non-piezoelectric 
crystalline materials, the atoms in their unit cells
are distributed symmetrically around a central point. But some crystalline materials
don't possess a center of symmetry making them candidates 
for piezoelectricity. Let's look at quartz, a piezoelectric material 
made of silicon and oxygen. The oxygens have a slight negative charge
and silicons have a slight positive, creating a separation of charge, or a dipole along each bond. Normally, these dipoles 
cancel each other out, so there's no net separation of charge
in the unit cell. But if a quartz crystal is squeezed
along a certain direction, the atoms shift. Because of the resulting asymmetry
in charge distribution, the dipoles no longer cancel
each other out. The stretched cell ends up
with a net negative charge on one side and a net positive on the other. This charge imbalance is repeated
all the way through the material, and opposite charges collect
on opposite faces of the crystal. This results in a voltage that can

the rhythmic oscillations of the quartz crystals
that keep watches running on time, the speakers of musical birthday cards, and the spark that ignites the gas 
in some barbecue grill lighters when you flick the switch. And piezoelectric devices may become
even more common since electricity is in high demand
and mechanical energy is abundant. There are already train stations
that use passengers' footsteps to power the ticket gates and displays and a dance club where piezoelectricity
helps power the lights. Could basketball players running back

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're asked
to invent something new. It could be whatever you want made from anything you choose in any shape or size. That kind of creative freedom
sounds so liberating, doesn't it? Or does it? If you're like most people,
you'd probably be paralyzed by this task. Without more guidance,
where would you even begin? As it turns out, boundless freedom
isn't always helpful. In reality, any project is restricted
by many factors, such as the cost, what materials you have at your disposal, and unbreakable laws of physics. These factors are called 
creative constraints, and they're the requirements 
and limitations we have to address 
in order to accomplish a goal. Creative constraints apply 
across professions, to architects and artists, writers, engineers, and scientists. In many fields, constraints play
a special role as drivers of discovery and invention. During the scientific process 
in particular, constraints are an essential part
of experimental design. For instance, a scientist studying
a new virus would consider, "How can I use the tools 
and techniques at hand to create an experiment that tells me
how this virus infects the body's cells? And what are the limits of my knowledge
that prevent me from understanding 
this new viral pathway?" In engineering, constraints have us
apply our scientific discoveries to invent something new and useful. Take, for example, 
the landers Viking 1 and 2, which relied on thrusters to arrive
safely on the surface of Mars. The problem? Those thrusters left foreign chemicals
on the ground, contaminating soil samples. So a new constraint was introduced. How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemicals
from Earth? The next Pathfinder mission used
an airbag system to allow the rover to bounce
and roll to a halt without burning contaminating fuel. Years later, we wanted to send
a much larger rover: Curiosity. However, it was too large 
for the airbag design, so another constraint was defined. How can we land a large rover
while still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil? In response, engineers had a wild idea. They designed a skycrane. Similar to the claw machine at toy stores, it would lower the rover 
from high above the surface. With each invention, the engineers
demonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking - that solutions must recognize
the limitations of current technology in order to advance it. Sometimes this progress is iterative, as in, "How can I make a better
parachute to land my rover?" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible 
parachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints 
guide decision-making to ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars 
problem yet to be solved. Say we want to send astronauts
who will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system
that keeps the water very clean and enables 100% recovery. Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have 
the technology for it now. But in the process of trying 
to meet these objectives, we might discover other applications
of any inventions that result. Building an innovative 
water filtration system could provide a solution for farmers
working in drought-stricken regions, or a way to clean municipal water
in polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures
in one field address the constraints of another. When scientist Alexander Fleming
mistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the discovery 
of the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the constraints
of other problems. Understanding constraints guides
scientific progress, and what's true in science
is also true in many other fields. Constraints aren't the boundaries
of creativity, but the foundation of it.

parachute to land my rover?" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible 
parachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints 
guide decision-making to ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars 
problem yet to be solved. Say we want to send astronauts
who will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system
that keeps the water very clean and enables 100% recovery. Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have 
the technology for it now. But in the process of trying 
to meet these objectives, we might discover other applications
of any inventions that result. Building an innovative 
water filtration system could provide a solution for farmers
working in drought-stricken regions, or a way to clean municipal water
in polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures
in one field address the constraints of another. When scientist Alexander Fleming
mistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the discovery 
of the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the constraints
of other problems. Understanding constraints guides
scientific progress, and what's true in science
is also true in many other fields. Constraints aren't the boundaries
of creativity, but the foundation of it.

They designed a skycrane to lower the rover from high above the surface, C. They used a different type of fuel, D. They abandoned the mission Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the specific NASA rover that used airbag technology to land safely on Mars.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 4: What was the problem with the thrusters used by the Viking 1 and 2 landers on Mars? Options: A. They were not powerful enough, B. They left foreign chemicals on the ground, contaminating soil samples, C. They were too expensive, D. They were not reliable Correct Option: B**

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ, but it does not directly ask about the rover that used airbag technology.

Since there is no direct match, I will choose the question that is most closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that **Question 4** mentions the Viking 1 and 2 landers, which is close to the ground truth MCQ. The next question, **Question 5**, mentions the problem of landing a large rover on Mars and the solution of using a skycrane, which is also related to the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the options provided, I realized that I made an incorrect assumption earlier. The correct match is actually not present among the options. However, if I had to choose the most similar question based on the content, I would choose **Question 4**.

However, I must note that **Question 4** does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. It only mentions the problem with the Viking 1 and 2 landers, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the NASA rover that used airbag technology.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content.

The correct match is not present among the options, but if I had to choose the most similar question, I would choose **Question 4**.

However, I realized that I missed something earlier. The correct match is not **Question 4**, but rather, there is no direct match among the options.

Since there is no direct match, I will re-evaluate the options.

**Transcript**:
As one of the most notorious gangsters
in history, Al Capone presided over a vast
and profitable empire of organized crime. When he was finally put on trial, the most he could be convicted of
was tax evasion. The nearly $100 million a year, that's 1.4 billion in today's currency, that Capone had earned from
illegal gambling, bootlegging, brothels, and extortion, would have served as evidence
of his crimes. But the money was nowhere
to be found. Capone and his associates had hidden it
through investments in various businesses whose ultimate ownership
couldn't be proven, like cash-only laundromats. In fact, those laundromats are part of
the reason for the name of this activity, money laundering. Money laundering came 
to be the term for any process that cleans illegally obtained funds
of their dirty criminal origins, allowing them to be used within
the legal economy. But Capone wasn't the first
to launder money. In fact, this practice is about
as old as money itself. Merchants hid their riches from
tax collecters, and pirates sought to sell their bounty
without drawing attention to how they got it. With the recent arrival 
of virtual currencies, offshore banking, the darknet, and global markets, schemes have become much more complex. Although modern money laundering
methods vary greatly, most share three basic steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement is where illegally obtained
money is converted into assets that seem legitimate. That's often done by depositing funds
into a bank account registered to an anonymous corporation
or a professional middleman. This step is where criminals are often
most vulnerable to detection since they introduce massive wealth
into the financial system seemingly out of nowhere. The second step, layering, involves
using multiple transactions to further distance the funds
from their origin. This can take the form of transfers
between multiple accounts, or the purchase of tradable property, like expensive cars, artwork, and real estate. Casinos, where large sums of money
change hands every second, are also popular venues for layering. A money launderer may have their
gambling balance made available at a casino chain's locations 
in other countries, or work with employees
to rig games. The last step, integration, allows clean
money to re-enter the mainstream economy and to benefit the original criminal. They might invest it into a legal business claiming payment by producing
fake invoices, or even start a bogus charity, placing themselves 
on the board of directors with an exorbitant salary. Money laundering itself wasn't officially recognized as a federal
crime in the United States until 1986. Before that point, the government
needed to prosecute a related crime, like tax evasion. From 1986 on, they could confiscate
wealth simply by demonstrating that concealment had occurred, which had a positive effect on prosecuting
major criminal operations, like drug traffickers. However, a legal shift has raised concerns involving privacy 
and government surveillance. Today, the United Nations, national governments, and various nonprofits fight against money laundering, yet the practice continues to play
a major role in global crime. And the most high-profile instances
of money laundering have involved 
not just private individuals, but major financial institutions
and government officials. No one knows for sure the total
amount of money that's laundered on a yearly basis, but some organizations estimate it to be
in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

**Transcript**:
As one of the most notorious gangsters
in history, Al Capone presided over a vast
and profitable empire of organized crime. When he was finally put on trial, the most he could be convicted of
was tax evasion. The nearly $100 million a year, that's 1.4 billion in today's currency, that Capone had earned from
illegal gambling, bootlegging, brothels, and extortion, would have served as evidence
of his crimes. But the money was nowhere
to be found. Capone and his associates had hidden it
through investments in various businesses whose ultimate ownership
couldn't be proven, like cash-only laundromats. In fact, those laundromats are part of
the reason for the name of this activity, money laundering. Money laundering came 
to be the term for any process that cleans illegally obtained funds
of their dirty criminal origins, allowing them to be used within
the legal economy. But Capone wasn't the first
to launder money. In fact, this practice is about
as old as money itself. Merchants hid their riches from
tax collecters, and pirates sought to sell their bounty
without drawing attention to how they got it. With the recent arrival 
of virtual currencies, offshore banking, the darknet, and global markets, schemes have become much more complex. Although modern money laundering
methods vary greatly, most share three basic steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement is where illegally obtained
money is converted into assets that seem legitimate. That's often done by depositing funds
into a bank account registered to an anonymous corporation
or a professional middleman. This step is where criminals are often
most vulnerable to detection since they introduce massive wealth
into the financial system seemingly out of nowhere. The second step, layering, involves
using multiple transactions to further distance the funds
from their origin. This can take the form of transfers
between multiple accounts, or the purchase of tradable property, like expensive cars, artwork, and real estate. Casinos, where large sums of money
change hands every second, are also popular venues for layering. A money launderer may have their
gambling balance made available at a casino chain's locations 
in other countries, or work with employees
to rig games. The last step, integration, allows clean
money to re-enter the mainstream economy and to benefit the original criminal. They might invest it into a legal business claiming payment by producing
fake invoices, or even start a bogus charity, placing themselves 
on the board of directors with an exorbitant salary. Money laundering itself wasn't officially recognized as a federal
crime in the United States until 1986. Before that point, the government
needed to prosecute a related crime, like tax evasion. From 1986 on, they could confiscate
wealth simply by demonstrating that concealment had occurred, which had a positive effect on prosecuting
major criminal operations, like drug traffickers. However, a legal shift has raised concerns involving privacy 
and government surveillance. Today, the United Nations, national governments, and various nonprofits fight against money laundering, yet the practice continues to play
a major role in global crime. And the most high-profile instances
of money laundering have involved 
not just private individuals, but major financial institutions
and government officials. No one knows for sure the total
amount of money that's laundered on a yearly basis, but some organizations estimate it to be
in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

**Transcript**:
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie 
discovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products
and jewelry. It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful
effects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Unfortunately, radium isn't the only
pigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly. That lamentable distinction includes
a trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves
and the things we make: white, green, and orange. Our story begins with white. As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make
the brilliant white pigment we know today. The problem? In humans, lead is directly absorbed
into the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal
functions of calcium, causing damages ranging 
from learning disabilities to high blood pressure. Yet the practice 
of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures. Lead white was the only practical choice
for white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century. To make their paint, artists would grind
a block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles. The pigment's liberal use resulted
in what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning. Artists who worked with lead complained
of palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. But lead white's density, opacity,
and warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,
and later, the Impressionists. Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely
used until it was banned in the 1970s. As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects 
pale in comparison to another, 
more wide-spread pigment, green. Two synthetic greens called 
Scheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century. They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens
made from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices
for paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing. These green pigments were made from
a compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic. In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells 
communicate and function. And high levels of arsenic have been
directly linked to cancer and heart disease. As a result, 18th century fabric
factory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses 
reportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin. Bed bugs were rumored not to live
in green rooms, and it's even been speculated that
Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green 
wallpapered bedroom. The intense toxicity of these green
stayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published
in 1822. And a century later, it was repurposed
as an insecticide. Synthetic green was probably the most
dangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's
property of radioactivity. Another color did, though - orange. Before World War II, it was common
for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes. The compound produced brilliant
reds and oranges, which were appealing attributes,
if not for the radiation they emitted. Of course, radiation was something
we were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks,
which we discovered much later. During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium
for use in bomb development. However, the atomic energy commission
relaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics
and glass factory floors. Orange dishes made during 
the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities
on their surfaces to this day. Most notably, vintage fiestaware
reads positive for radioactivity. And while the levels are low enough that
they don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food
off of them. Though we still occasionally run 
into issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us
prune hazardous colors out of our lives.

**Transcript**:
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie 
discovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products
and jewelry. It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful
effects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Unfortunately, radium isn't the only
pigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly. That lamentable distinction includes
a trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves
and the things we make: white, green, and orange. Our story begins with white. As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make
the brilliant white pigment we know today. The problem? In humans, lead is directly absorbed
into the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal
functions of calcium, causing damages ranging 
from learning disabilities to high blood pressure. Yet the practice 
of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures. Lead white was the only practical choice
for white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century. To make their paint, artists would grind
a block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles. The pigment's liberal use resulted
in what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning. Artists who worked with lead complained
of palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. But lead white's density, opacity,
and warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,
and later, the Impressionists. Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely
used until it was banned in the 1970s. As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects 
pale in comparison to another, 
more wide-spread pigment, green. Two synthetic greens called 
Scheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century. They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens
made from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices
for paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing. These green pigments were made from
a compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic. In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells 
communicate and function. And high levels of arsenic have been
directly linked to cancer and heart disease. As a result, 18th century fabric
factory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses 
reportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin. Bed bugs were rumored not to live
in green rooms, and it's even been speculated that
Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green 
wallpapered bedroom. The intense toxicity of these green
stayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published
in 1822. And a century later, it was repurposed
as an insecticide. Synthetic green was probably the most
dangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's
property of radioactivity. Another color did, though - orange. Before World War II, it was common
for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes. The compound produced brilliant
reds and oranges, which were appealing attributes,
if not for the radiation they emitted. Of course, radiation was something
we were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks,
which we discovered much later. During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium
for use in bomb development. However, the atomic energy commission
relaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics
and glass factory floors. Orange dishes made during 
the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities
on their surfaces to this day. Most notably, vintage fiestaware
reads positive for radioactivity. And while the levels are low enough that
they don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food
off of them. Though we still occasionally run 
into issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us
prune hazardous colors out of our lives.

**Transcript**:
During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor 
of agriculture, highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea
was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built
the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown 
around the world today, yet it was originally consumed
very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste
out of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations
to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures
in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art
you might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century 
during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first
tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed
their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation 
of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century 
during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor 
shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes
to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a
virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three 
essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power
and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest
around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe
in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,
a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with
the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the
midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew,
interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times
the price of coffee and the plant was still 
only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, 
the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea
back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid
for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea 
for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem
within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official 
ordered his men to destroy massive 
British shipments of opium as a statement against 
Britain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War
between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down 
the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded
the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing
for over a century. The British East India company also
wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned 
botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China 
in a covert operation. He disguised himself 
and took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees 
and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, 
the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth
as an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed
beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways
of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 has some relation to the timeline of tea consumption. However, a more relevant question is Question 9, which mentions the story of Shennong but doesn't directly ask about the timeline. 

A more suitable match is not available as none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the timeline of tea consumption as a beverage. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the most relevant, as it mentions the original way of consuming tea in ancient China and provides a starting point to understand the evolution of tea consumption.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the other two essential goods China exported along with tea, which is not directly addressed in any of the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the most relevant generated MCQ based on the context of the transcript, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it does not match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. Since there is no direct match, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that has some relevance to the topic.

Index: 8 (Note: This is not a direct match, but it has some relevance to the topic of China's tea trade and export goods.)

A more suitable approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ or to acknowledge that there is no matching MCQ in the provided set.

**Transcript**:
During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor 
of agriculture, highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea
was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built
the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown 
around the world today, yet it was originally consumed
very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste
out of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations
to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures
in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art
you might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century 
during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first
tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed
their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation 
of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century 
during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor 
shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes
to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a
virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three 
essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power
and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest
around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe
in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,
a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with
the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the
midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew,
interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times
the price of coffee and the plant was still 
only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, 
the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea
back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid
for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea 
for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem
within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official 
ordered his men to destroy massive 
British shipments of opium as a statement against 
Britain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War
between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down 
the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded
the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing
for over a century. The British East India company also
wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned 
botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China 
in a covert operation. He disguised himself 
and took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees 
and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, 
the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth
as an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed
beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways
of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.

**Transcript**:
It starts with a cough, or a wheeze. Soon, your chest feels tight. Your breathing speeds up
and gets shallower, making you feel short of breath. These are common symptoms
of an asthma attack. Around the world, more than 300 million
people suffer from asthma, and around 250,000 people 
die from it each year. But why do people get asthma
and how can this disease be deadly? Asthma affects the respiratory system, particularly the smaller airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. These airways have an inner lining
called the mucosa that's surrounded 
by a layer of smooth muscle. In people with asthma, the airways
are chronically inflamed, which can make them hyper-responsive
to certain triggers. Some of the many asthma triggers
include tobacco smoke, pollen, dust, fragrances, exercise, cold weather, stress, and even the common cold. When people with asthma are exposed
to these triggers, an asthma attack, or exacerbation,
can occur. But how exactly do such everyday factors
lead to an asthma attack? If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger, the smooth rings of muscle that circle
the small airways in their lungs contract and become narrow. Simultaneously, the trigger
worsens inflammation, causing the mucosal lining
to become more swollen and secrete more mucus. Under normal conditions, the body uses this mucus to trap
and clear particles, like pollen or dust, but during an asthma attack, it blocks the narrowed airways,
making it even harder to breathe. These effects lead 
to this symptoms of asthma. Smooth muscle constriction results
in the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation
can cause coughing. And the wheezing noise? That happens because 
as the airways constrict, air whistles as it passes through
the narrowed space. These symptoms may make a person
feel like they're running out of air. Yet counterintuitively, 
during an asthma attack, the inflammation can make it harder
to exhale than inhale. Over time, this leads to an excess
of air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. The trapping of air inside the lungs
forces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen
delivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated 
severe asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from
lack of oxygen. So how do we prevent these uncomfortable
and potentially fatal attacks in people who have asthma? One way is to reduce the presence
of triggers. Unfortunately, the world 
is an unpredictable place and exposure to triggers can't
always be controlled. This is where inhalers, the primary
treatment for asthma, come in. These medications help asthmatics both
control and prevent their asthma symptoms. Inhalers transport medication along
the affected airways using a liquid mist or fine powder
to treat the problem at its source. They come in two forms. There are reliever medications, which treat symptoms immediately
and contain beta-agonists. Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces, allowing the airways to widen so more air
can travel into and out of the lungs. The other form of inhalers serve
as preventive medications, which treat asthma symptoms
over the long term, and contain corticosteroids. Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity
and inflammation, so asthma can be kept under control. They're also crucial in preventing
long-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways. Inhalers are known to be very effective, and have helped many people
live better lives. Although we've come a long way
in improving how we treat and diagnose asthma, we still don't know its exact causes. We currently believe that a combination
of genetic and environmental factors play a role, potentially acting during early childhood. Recent research has even linked
poverty to asthma incidents. This may be due to reasons ranging from exposure to additional pollutants
and environmental irritants to difficulties in obtaining medical care
or treatment. As our understanding of asthma improves, we can continue to find better ways to
keep people's airways happy and healthy.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
It starts with a cough, or a wheeze. Soon, your chest feels tight. Your breathing speeds up
and gets shallower, making you feel short of breath. These are common symptoms
of an asthma attack. Around the world, more than 300 million
people suffer from asthma, and around 250,000 people 
die from it each year. But why do people get asthma
and how can this disease be deadly? Asthma affects the respiratory system, particularly the smaller airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. These airways have an inner lining
called the mucosa that's surrounded 
by a layer of smooth muscle. In people with asthma, the airways
are chronically inflamed, which can make them hyper-responsive
to certain triggers. Some of the many asthma triggers
include tobacco smoke, pollen, dust, fragrances, exercise, cold weather, stress, and even the common cold. When people with asthma are exposed
to these triggers, an asthma attack, or exacerbation,
can occur. But how exactly do such everyday factors
lead to an asthma attack? If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger, the smooth rings of muscle that circle
the small airways in their lungs contract and become narrow. Simultaneously, the trigger
worsens inflammation, causing the mucosal lining
to become more swollen and secrete more mucus. Under normal conditions, the body uses this mucus to trap
and clear particles, like pollen or dust, but during an asthma attack, it blocks the narrowed airways,
making it even harder to breathe. These effects lead 
to this symptoms of asthma. Smooth muscle constriction results
in the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation
can cause coughing. And the wheezing noise? That happens because 
as the airways constrict, air whistles as it passes through
the narrowed space. These symptoms may make a person
feel like they're running out of air. Yet counterintuitively, 
during an asthma attack, the inflammation can make it harder
to exhale than inhale. Over time, this leads to an excess
of air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. The trapping of air inside the lungs
forces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen
delivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated 
severe asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from
lack of oxygen. So how do we prevent these uncomfortable
and potentially fatal attacks in people who have asthma? One way is to reduce the presence
of triggers. Unfortunately, the world 
is an unpredictable place and exposure to triggers can't
always be controlled. This is where inhalers, the primary
treatment for asthma, come in. These medications help asthmatics both
control and prevent their asthma symptoms. Inhalers transport medication along
the affected airways using a liquid mist or fine powder
to treat the problem at its source. They come in two forms. There are reliever medications, which treat symptoms immediately
and contain beta-agonists. Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces, allowing the airways to widen so more air
can travel into and out of the lungs. The other form of inhalers serve
as preventive medications, which treat asthma symptoms
over the long term, and contain corticosteroids. Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity
and inflammation, so asthma can be kept under control. They're also crucial in preventing
long-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways. Inhalers are known to be very effective, and have helped many people
live better lives. Although we've come a long way
in improving how we treat and diagnose asthma, we still don't know its exact causes. We currently believe that a combination
of genetic and environmental factors play a role, potentially acting during early childhood. Recent research has even linked
poverty to asthma incidents. This may be due to reasons ranging from exposure to additional pollutants
and environmental irritants to difficulties in obtaining medical care
or treatment. As our understanding of asthma improves, we can continue to find better ways to
keep people's airways happy and healthy.

Then it is mentioned that "The trapping of air inside the lungs forces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen delivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated severe asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from lack of oxygen. **But then it is also mentioned that** "Over time, this leads to an excess of air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. **And then also mentioned is** "They're also crucial in preventing long-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways."

So while MCQ 7 and MCQ 5 are close, they aren't the best possible match.

**Generated MCQ 3's explanation**: "Smooth muscle constriction results in the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation can cause coughing." Then "These effects lead to the symptoms of asthma. **But then also mentioned is** "Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen delivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated severe asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from lack of oxygen. **But then it is also mentioned that** "They're also crucial in preventing long-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways."

Considering the options of the generated MCQs, the closest match is still MCQ 7.

However, there isn't a perfect match for the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose one, I would say **Generated MCQ 7** is the closest match.

However, a new generated MCQ that combined elements of MCQ 3, MCQ 5, and MCQ 7 would be an even better match.

**New Generated MCQ**: Long-term damage of the respiratory system's airways can happen in asthma due to _____. 
Options: A. Reduced oxygen delivery, B. Chronic inflammation, C. Excess mucous, D. Smooth muscle constriction 

This new generated MCQ would be the best possible match.

However, if I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say **Generated MCQ 7** is the closest match.

Keep in mind that while Generated MCQ 7 is the closest match, it isn't a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again. They did this by creating 
for the first time a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global
electricity market, nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades. What happened to the great promise
of this technology? It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast. To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times 
its natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high, containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air, spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products
in these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds 
of thousands of years. The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans
or the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature. This mix must be isolated from
the environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security. How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential. But their successors have learned
humbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.

**Transcript**:
On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again. They did this by creating 
for the first time a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global
electricity market, nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades. What happened to the great promise
of this technology? It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast. To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times 
its natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high, containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air, spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products
in these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds 
of thousands of years. The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans
or the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature. This mix must be isolated from
the environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security. How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential. But their successors have learned
humbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 and Question 5 are related to the topic. However, none of the generated MCQs directly asks about the substance used as a moderator to scatter and slow down neutrons.

However, I can suggest that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, which talks about the purpose of enrichment in the nuclear fuel production process. Although it does not directly ask about the moderator, it is related to the process of sustaining a chain reaction.

But since it's not an exact match, I'll provide a more detailed analysis:

The ground truth MCQ asks about the substance used as a moderator to scatter and slow down neutrons. The correct answer is "Both Graphite and Purified water" (Option D).

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest that it would be a new question that combines elements of Question 1 (which mentions the event in Chicago) and Question 5 (which talks about the process of sustaining a chain reaction). However, since that's not an option, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is closest to the topic:

 Question 5.

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly ask about the substance used as a moderator.

**Transcript**:
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make

**Transcript**:
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food

**Transcript**:
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 2 does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content, I will provide a more detailed analysis.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the size of the largest giant ground sloths, while the generated MCQs do not directly address this question. However, Question 2 does mention the size of the sloths in its options and the transcript does provide information about the size of the Megatherium, which is comparable to an elephant.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly asks about the size of the largest giant ground sloths. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and intent, I would suggest that a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the size of the largest giant ground sloths would be the most suitable match.

However, if I had to choose from the provided generated MCQs, I would say that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of content.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or 2, if we consider the closest match in terms of content)

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of sloth species alive today. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 mentions the extinction of ground sloths and the fact that some smaller sloths survived and migrated to the treetops. However, it does not provide information about the exact number of species alive today.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4. However, please note that it is not a direct match.

A more suitable approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. Here's an example:

**Transcript**:
Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison
to lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It's just one of the many thousands
of tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles
covers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for 
the heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly 
is the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches
via tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only
found in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines
the blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are 
made up of muscle cells, also known as fibers,
bundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from
the nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn
generates force and motion. This produces almost all
the movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed 
by the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split
into three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers
and lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten
while the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it 
bend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship 
is reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership
exists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction
creates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers
don't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee
or lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture
by holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk
of the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us,
like the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so,
like the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek
to your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment
called the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are
connected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control
over their movements. This muscle group also contains
two types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further,
slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly
when triggered but quickly use up their energy
and tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,
are endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly
so they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more
fast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly,
pick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain 
more slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's
cardiac and smooth muscles are managed by 
the autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump
roughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body 
with blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts
and relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth
internal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and
push food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract
when a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy
and produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides 
about 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels
then spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain
the temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system 
may be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost
everything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye
or a race to the finish line.

**Transcript**:
Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison
to lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It's just one of the many thousands
of tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles
covers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for 
the heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly 
is the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches
via tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only
found in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines
the blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are 
made up of muscle cells, also known as fibers,
bundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from
the nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn
generates force and motion. This produces almost all
the movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed 
by the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split
into three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers
and lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten
while the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it 
bend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship 
is reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership
exists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction
creates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers
don't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee
or lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture
by holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk
of the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us,
like the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so,
like the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek
to your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment
called the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are
connected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control
over their movements. This muscle group also contains
two types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further,
slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly
when triggered but quickly use up their energy
and tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,
are endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly
so they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more
fast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly,
pick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain 
more slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's
cardiac and smooth muscles are managed by 
the autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump
roughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body 
with blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts
and relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth
internal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and
push food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract
when a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy
and produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides 
about 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels
then spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain
the temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system 
may be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost
everything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye
or a race to the finish line.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, a group of ranchers in Idaho were baffled when their sheep gave birth
to lambs with a singular deformity. Mystified by these cyclops sheep, they called in scientists from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to investigate. The researchers hypothesized
that the pregnant ewes had snacked on poisonous 
birth defect-causing plants. They collected the local flora
and fed samples to lab rats, but struggled to replicate the effect. So they decided 
to directly observe the sheep with one scientist even living
with the herd for three summers. After a decade of trial and error,
the scientists finally found the culprit, wild corn lilies. The lilies contained an active molecule
with six connected rings that they named cyclopamine
in reference to the cyclops sheep. They didn't know exactly
how cyclopamine caused the defect but told ranchers to steer clear. It took about four decades before
a team of biologists, led by Professor Philip Beachy, stumbled upon the answer. His lab was studying a specific gene
found in many species, from mice to humans, called the hedgehog gene. It was named by two scientists, who later
shared the Noble Prize for their work, who found that mutating 
this gene in fruit flies produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog. Beachy and his colleagues performed
genetic modifications to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice. This resulted in severe defects 
in the development of their brains, organs, and eyes or, rather, eye. Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy 
came across photos of the cyclops sheep and realized what had eluded scientists
for four decades. Something must have gone awry 
involving the hedgehog gene. Let's take a step back. Genes contain instructions that tell
cells what to do and when to do it, and they communicate their directives
using proteins. The hedgehog gene itself tells cells
to release a so-called hedgehog protein, which kicks off a complex 
series of cellular signals. Here's how it works in normal
healthy development. Hedgehog protein latches on to
a protein called patched. That inhibits, or holds, patched back, allowing another protein called
smoothened to freely signal the cells, telling them where to go
and what kind of tissues to become. Cyclopamine, say in the form 
of a delicious corn lily, interrupts this pathway
by binding onto smoothened. That locks smoothened up so that
it's unable to send the signals needed to mold the brain 
into two hemispheres, and form fingers or separate eyes. So even though the hedgehog
protein is still doing its job of keeping the way clear for smoothened, cyclopamine blocks smoothened
from passing along its chemical message. That settled the science
behind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team 
caught the glimmer of another more beneficial connection. They noted that uncontrolled activation
of the smoothened protein was associated with a human syndrome. It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,
and it predisposes people to certain cancers. The scientists proposed putting cyclopamine's smoothened 
binding powers to good use as a treatment for these cancers, as long as the patient wasn't pregnant. Unfortunately, researchers eventually
found that cyclopamine causes negative side effects, and its chemical properties
make it difficult to work with. But they did discover that closely
related molecules are safe and effective, and two of these drugs were approved
in 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines. When those farmers first saw
the cyclops sheep, they could have chalked it up to
a freak genetic mutation and walked away. Instead, their decision to investigate
turned a mystery into medicine showing that sometimes
there's more than meets the eye.

from passing along its chemical message. That settled the science
behind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team 
caught the glimmer of another more beneficial connection. They noted that uncontrolled activation
of the smoothened protein was associated with a human syndrome. It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,
and it predisposes people to certain cancers. The scientists proposed putting cyclopamine's smoothened 
binding powers to good use as a treatment for these cancers, as long as the patient wasn't pregnant. Unfortunately, researchers eventually
found that cyclopamine causes negative side effects, and its chemical properties
make it difficult to work with. But they did discover that closely
related molecules are safe and effective, and two of these drugs were approved
in 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines. When those farmers first saw
the cyclops sheep, they could have chalked it up to
a freak genetic mutation and walked away. Instead, their decision to investigate
turned a mystery into medicine showing that sometimes
there's more than meets the eye.

**Transcript**:
In the 1950s, a group of ranchers in Idaho were baffled when their sheep gave birth
to lambs with a singular deformity. Mystified by these cyclops sheep, they called in scientists from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture to investigate. The researchers hypothesized
that the pregnant ewes had snacked on poisonous 
birth defect-causing plants. They collected the local flora
and fed samples to lab rats, but struggled to replicate the effect. So they decided 
to directly observe the sheep with one scientist even living
with the herd for three summers. After a decade of trial and error,
the scientists finally found the culprit, wild corn lilies. The lilies contained an active molecule
with six connected rings that they named cyclopamine
in reference to the cyclops sheep. They didn't know exactly
how cyclopamine caused the defect but told ranchers to steer clear. It took about four decades before
a team of biologists, led by Professor Philip Beachy, stumbled upon the answer. His lab was studying a specific gene
found in many species, from mice to humans, called the hedgehog gene. It was named by two scientists, who later
shared the Noble Prize for their work, who found that mutating 
this gene in fruit flies produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog. Beachy and his colleagues performed
genetic modifications to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice. This resulted in severe defects 
in the development of their brains, organs, and eyes or, rather, eye. Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy 
came across photos of the cyclops sheep and realized what had eluded scientists
for four decades. Something must have gone awry 
involving the hedgehog gene. Let's take a step back. Genes contain instructions that tell
cells what to do and when to do it, and they communicate their directives
using proteins. The hedgehog gene itself tells cells
to release a so-called hedgehog protein, which kicks off a complex 
series of cellular signals. Here's how it works in normal
healthy development. Hedgehog protein latches on to
a protein called patched. That inhibits, or holds, patched back, allowing another protein called
smoothened to freely signal the cells, telling them where to go
and what kind of tissues to become. Cyclopamine, say in the form 
of a delicious corn lily, interrupts this pathway
by binding onto smoothened. That locks smoothened up so that
it's unable to send the signals needed to mold the brain 
into two hemispheres, and form fingers or separate eyes. So even though the hedgehog
protein is still doing its job of keeping the way clear for smoothened, cyclopamine blocks smoothened
from passing along its chemical message. That settled the science
behind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team

**Transcript**:
They say the pen is mightier 
than the sword, and authorities have often agreed. From outlawed religious tracts
and revolutionary manifestos to censored and burned books, we know the potential power
of words to overturn the social order. But as strange as it may seem, some numbers have also been considered
dangerous enough to ban. Our distant ancestors long counted
objects using simple tally marks. But as they developed agriculture and
began living together in larger groups, this was no longer enough. As numbers grew more complex, people began not just using them,
but thinking about what they are and how they work. And by 600 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece,
the study of numbers was well-developed. The mathematician Pythagoras
and his school of followers found numerical patterns in shapes,
music, and the stars. For them, mathematics held 
the deepest secrets of the universe. But one Pythagorean named Hippasus
discovered something disturbing. Some quantities, like the diagonal
of a square with sides of length one couldn't be expressed by any combination
of whole numbers or fractions, no matter how small. These numbers, 
which we call irrational numbers, were perceived as a threat to the Pythagorean's notion 
of a perfect universe. They imagined a reality 
that could be described with rational, numerical patterns. Historians write that Hippasus
was exhiled for publicizing his findings, while legends claim he was drowned
as punishment from the gods. While irrational numbers 
upset philosophers, later mathematical inventions
would draw attention from political 
and religious authorities, as well. In the Middle Ages, while Europe
was still using Roman numerals, other cultures had developed 
positional systems that included a symbol for zero. When Arab travelers brought this system
to the bustling maritime cities of Italy, its advantages for merchants
and bankers was clear. But the authorities were more wary. Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered
easier to forge or alter, especially since they were less
familiar to customers than to merchants. And the concept of zero opened 
the door to negative numbers and the recording of debt at a time when moneylending
was regarded with suspicion. In the 13th century, Florence banned
the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals for record keeping. And though they soon proved
too useful to ignore, controversies over zero 
and negative numbers continued for a long time. Negative numbers 
were dismissed as absurd well into the 19th century. And prominent mathematicians,
like Gerolamo Cardano, avoided using zero, even though it would have made it
much easier to find solutions to cubic and the quartic equations. Even today it's illegal to use
some numbers for different reasons. Some are banned because
of what they represent. For example, governments
have prohibited the display of numbers that have symbolic meaning, such as the date of a revolution or connections to oppositional 
political figures or parties. Other numbers are potentially illegal
because of the information they carry. Just about any information, whether text, image, video, or executable programs can
be translated into a string of numbers. But this means that protected information, whether copyrights, proprietary materials, or state secrets can also be represented as numbers, so possessing or publishing these numbers
may be treated as a criminal offense. This idea gathered attention in 2001 when code that could be used
to decrypt DVDs was widely shared and distributed
in the form of a large prime number. The idea of illegal numbers 
may sound absurd, but like words, written numbers are a way
of expressing concepts and information. And in a world where calculations 
and algorithms shape more and more of our lives, the mathematician's pencil
grows stronger by the day.

of a square with sides of length one couldn't be expressed by any combination
of whole numbers or fractions, no matter how small. These numbers, 
which we call irrational numbers, were perceived as a threat to the Pythagorean's notion 
of a perfect universe. They imagined a reality 
that could be described with rational, numerical patterns. Historians write that Hippasus
was exhiled for publicizing his findings, while legends claim he was drowned
as punishment from the gods. While irrational numbers 
upset philosophers, later mathematical inventions
would draw attention from political 
and religious authorities, as well. In the Middle Ages, while Europe
was still using Roman numerals, other cultures had developed 
positional systems that included a symbol for zero. When Arab travelers brought this system
to the bustling maritime cities of Italy, its advantages for merchants
and bankers was clear. But the authorities were more wary. Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered
easier to forge or alter, especially since they were less
familiar to customers than to merchants. And the concept of zero opened 
the door to negative numbers and the recording of debt at a time when moneylending
was regarded with suspicion. In the 13th century, Florence banned
the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals for record keeping. And though they soon proved
too useful to ignore, controversies over zero 
and negative numbers continued for a long time. Negative numbers 
were dismissed as absurd well into the 19th century. And prominent mathematicians,
like Gerolamo Cardano, avoided using zero, even though it would have made it
much easier to find solutions to cubic and the quartic equations. Even today it's illegal to use
some numbers for different reasons. Some are banned because
of what they represent. For example, governments
have prohibited the display of numbers that have symbolic meaning, such as the date of a revolution or connections to oppositional 
political figures or parties. Other numbers are potentially illegal
because of the information they carry. Just about any information, whether text, image, video, or executable programs can
be translated into a string of numbers. But this means that protected information, whether copyrights, proprietary materials, or state secrets can also be represented as numbers, so possessing or publishing these numbers
may be treated as a criminal offense. This idea gathered attention in 2001 when code that could be used
to decrypt DVDs was widely shared and distributed
in the form of a large prime number. The idea of illegal numbers 
may sound absurd, but like words, written numbers are a way
of expressing concepts and information. And in a world where calculations 
and algorithms shape more and more of our lives, the mathematician's pencil
grows stronger by the day.

**Transcript**:
Look at your hand. How do you know it's really yours? It seems obvious, unless you've
experienced the rubber hand illusion. In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed
in front of you and your real hand is hidden
behind a screen. Both are simultaneously stroked
with a paint brush. No matter how much you remind yourself
the dummy hand isn't yours, you eventually start to feel like it is, and inevitably flinch
when it's threatened with a knife. That may just be a temporary trick,
but it speaks to a larger truth: our bodies, the physical, 
biological parts of us, and our minds, the thinking,
conscious aspects, have a complicated, tangled relationship. Which one primarily defines you
or your self? Are you a physical body that only
experiences thoughts and emotions as a result of biochemical interactions
in the brain? That would be a body with a mind. Or is there some non-physical part of you
that's pulling the strings but could live outside 
of your biological body? That would be a mind with a body. That takes us to an old question of whether the body 
and mind are two separate things. In a famous thought experiment, 16th-century philosopher 
René Descartes pointed out that even if all our physical sensations
were just a hallucinatory dream, our mind and thoughts 
would still be there. That, for him, was the ultimate proof
of our existence. And it led him to conclude that the conscious mind is something separate
from the material body that forms the core of our identity. The notion of a non-physical consciousness echoes the belief of many religions
in an immaterial soul for which the body is only 
a temporary shell. If we accept this, 
another problem emerges. How can a non-physical mind have
any interaction with the physical body? If the mind has no shape, 
weight, or motion, how can it move your muscles? Or if we assume it can, why can your mind
only move your body and not others? Some thinkers have found creative ways
to get around this dilemma. For example, the French priest 
and philosopher Nicolas Malebranche claimed that when we think about
reaching for a fork, it's actually god who moves our hand. Another priest philosopher 
named George Berkeley concluded that the material world
is an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions. This question of mind versus body
isn't just the domain of philosophers. With the development of psychology
and neuroscience, scientists have weighed in, as well. Many modern scientists reject the idea that there's any distinction 
between the mind and body. Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,
along with their physical senses, are deeply integrated 
with the activity in our brains to form what we call consciousness. From the day we're born, our mental development is formed
through our body's interaction with the external world. Every sight, sound, and touch create
new maps and representations in the brain that eventually become responsible
for regulating our experience of self. And we have other senses,
besides the typical five, such as the sense of balance and a sense of the relative location
of our body parts. The rubber hand illusion,
and similar virtual reality experiments, show that our senses can easily
mislead us in our judgment of self. They also suggest that our bodies
and external sensations are inseparable from 
our subjective consciousness. If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'
experiment was mistaken from the start. After all, if we close our eyes
in a silent room, the feeling of having a body
isn't something we can just imagine away. This question of mind and body
becomes particularly interesting at a time when we're considering
future technologies, such as neural prosthetics
and wearable robots that could become extended parts
of our bodies. Or the slightly more radical idea
of mind uploading, which dangles the possibility 
of immortal life without a body by transferring a human consciousness
into a computer. If the body is deeply mapped
in the brain, then by extending our sense of self
to new wearable devices, our brains may eventually adapt
to a restructured version with new sensory representations. Or perhaps uploading our consciousness
into a computer might not even be possible unless we can also simulate a body
capable of delivering physical sensations. The idea that our bodies are part
of our consciousness and vice versa also isn't new. It's found extensively 
in Buddhist thought, as well as the writings of philosophers
from Heidegger to Aristotle. But for now, we're still left
with the open question of what exactly our self is. Are we a mind equipped with
a physical body as Descartes suggested? Or a complex organism 
that's gained consciousness over millions of years of evolution thanks to a bigger brain and
more neurons than our distant ancestors? Or something else entirely that
no one's yet dreamt up?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In the rubber hand illusion, the dummy hand feels like the viewer’s real hand because of the synchronization between two sensory inputs from both hands. What are those two sensory inputs?
Options: A. Touch and sound, B. Touch and vision, C. Vision and pain, D. Vision and proprioception
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the main idea behind the rubber hand illusion experiment?
Options: A. To demonstrate the power of the human brain in controlling the body., B. To show how our senses can easily mislead us in our judgment of self., C. To test the limits of human endurance and pain tolerance., D. To prove the existence of a non-physical consciousness.

**Transcript**:
Look at your hand. How do you know it's really yours? It seems obvious, unless you've
experienced the rubber hand illusion. In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed
in front of you and your real hand is hidden
behind a screen. Both are simultaneously stroked
with a paint brush. No matter how much you remind yourself
the dummy hand isn't yours, you eventually start to feel like it is, and inevitably flinch
when it's threatened with a knife. That may just be a temporary trick,
but it speaks to a larger truth: our bodies, the physical, 
biological parts of us, and our minds, the thinking,
conscious aspects, have a complicated, tangled relationship. Which one primarily defines you
or your self? Are you a physical body that only
experiences thoughts and emotions as a result of biochemical interactions
in the brain? That would be a body with a mind. Or is there some non-physical part of you
that's pulling the strings but could live outside 
of your biological body? That would be a mind with a body. That takes us to an old question of whether the body 
and mind are two separate things. In a famous thought experiment, 16th-century philosopher 
René Descartes pointed out that even if all our physical sensations
were just a hallucinatory dream, our mind and thoughts 
would still be there. That, for him, was the ultimate proof
of our existence. And it led him to conclude that the conscious mind is something separate
from the material body that forms the core of our identity. The notion of a non-physical consciousness echoes the belief of many religions
in an immaterial soul for which the body is only 
a temporary shell. If we accept this, 
another problem emerges. How can a non-physical mind have
any interaction with the physical body? If the mind has no shape, 
weight, or motion, how can it move your muscles? Or if we assume it can, why can your mind
only move your body and not others? Some thinkers have found creative ways
to get around this dilemma. For example, the French priest 
and philosopher Nicolas Malebranche claimed that when we think about
reaching for a fork, it's actually god who moves our hand. Another priest philosopher 
named George Berkeley concluded that the material world
is an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions. This question of mind versus body
isn't just the domain of philosophers. With the development of psychology
and neuroscience, scientists have weighed in, as well. Many modern scientists reject the idea that there's any distinction 
between the mind and body. Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,
along with their physical senses, are deeply integrated 
with the activity in our brains to form what we call consciousness. From the day we're born, our mental development is formed
through our body's interaction with the external world. Every sight, sound, and touch create
new maps and representations in the brain that eventually become responsible
for regulating our experience of self. And we have other senses,
besides the typical five, such as the sense of balance and a sense of the relative location
of our body parts. The rubber hand illusion,
and similar virtual reality experiments, show that our senses can easily
mislead us in our judgment of self. They also suggest that our bodies
and external sensations are inseparable from 
our subjective consciousness. If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'
experiment was mistaken from the start. After all, if we close our eyes
in a silent room, the feeling of having a body
isn't something we can just imagine away. This question of mind and body
becomes particularly interesting at a time when we're considering
future technologies, such as neural prosthetics
and wearable robots that could become extended parts
of our bodies. Or the slightly more radical idea
of mind uploading, which dangles the possibility 
of immortal life without a body by transferring a human consciousness
into a computer. If the body is deeply mapped
in the brain, then by extending our sense of self
to new wearable devices, our brains may eventually adapt
to a restructured version with new sensory representations. Or perhaps uploading our consciousness
into a computer might not even be possible unless we can also simulate a body
capable of delivering physical sensations. The idea that our bodies are part
of our consciousness and vice versa also isn't new. It's found extensively 
in Buddhist thought, as well as the writings of philosophers
from Heidegger to Aristotle. But for now, we're still left
with the open question of what exactly our self is. Are we a mind equipped with
a physical body as Descartes suggested? Or a complex organism 
that's gained consciousness over millions of years of evolution thanks to a bigger brain and
more neurons than our distant ancestors? Or something else entirely that
no one's yet dreamt up?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The first standardized tests 
that we know of were administered in China 
over 2,000 years ago during the Han dynasty. Chinese officials used them to determine
aptitude for various government posts. The subject matter included philosophy, farming, and even military tactics. Standardized tests continued to be used
around the world for the next two millennia, and today, they're used for everything from evaluating stair climbs
for firefighters in France to language examinations 
for diplomats in Canada to students in schools. Some standardized tests measure scores only in relation to the results 
of other test takers. Others measure performances on how well
test takers meet predetermined criteria. So the stair climb for the firefighter could be measured by comparing 
the time of the climb to that of all other firefighters. This might be expressed in what 
many call a bell curve. Or it could be evaluated with reference
to set criteria, such as carrying a certain amount 
of weight a certain distance up a certain number of stairs. Similarly, the diplomat might be measured
against other test-taking diplomats, or against a set of fixed criteria, which demonstrate different levels
of language proficiency. And all of these results can be expressed
using something called a percentile. If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile,
70% of test takers scored below her. If she scored in the 30th percentile,
70% of test takers scored above her. Although standardized tests 
are sometimes controversial, they're simply a tool. As a thought experiment, 
think of a standardized test as a ruler. A ruler's usefulness 
depends on two things. First, the job we ask it to do. Our ruler can't measure 
the temperature outside or how loud someone is singing. Second, the ruler's usefulness depends
on its design. Say you need to measure the circumference
of an orange. Our ruler measures length,
which is the right quantity, but it hasn't been designed with the 
flexibility required for the task at hand. So, if standardized tests are given
the wrong job, or aren't designed properly, they may end up measuring
the wrong things. In the case of schools, students with test anxiety may have 
trouble performing their best on a standardized test, not because they don't know the answers, but because they're feeling too nervous
to share what they've learned. Students with reading challenges may struggle with the wording 
of a math problem, so their test results may better reflect
their literacy rather than numeracy skills. And students who were confused by examples on tests that contain 
unfamiliar cultural references may do poorly, telling us more about the test taker's
cultural familiarity than their academic learning. In these cases, the tests may need
to be designed differently. Standardized tests can also 
have a hard time measuring abstract 
characteristics or skills, such as creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration. If we design a test poorly, or ask it to do the wrong job, or a job it's not very good at, the results may not be reliable or valid. Reliability and validity 
are two critical ideas for understanding standardized tests. To understand the difference between them, we can use the metaphor 
of two broken thermometers. An unreliable thermometer gives you a different reading 
each time you take your temperature, and the reliable but invalid thermometer
is consistently ten degrees too hot. Validity also depends on accurate
interpretations of results. If people say results of a test
mean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler
to tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone
to reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle
a tough situation, or how brave a firefighter 
might turn out to be. So standardized tests may help us learn
a little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot
about a single person. Many social scientists worry about
test scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes
for test takers, sometimes with long-term 
life consequences. We can't blame the tests, though. It's up to us to use the right tests
for the right jobs, and to interpret results appropriately.

**Transcript**:
The first standardized tests 
that we know of were administered in China 
over 2,000 years ago during the Han dynasty. Chinese officials used them to determine
aptitude for various government posts. The subject matter included philosophy, farming, and even military tactics. Standardized tests continued to be used
around the world for the next two millennia, and today, they're used for everything from evaluating stair climbs
for firefighters in France to language examinations 
for diplomats in Canada to students in schools. Some standardized tests measure scores only in relation to the results 
of other test takers. Others measure performances on how well
test takers meet predetermined criteria. So the stair climb for the firefighter could be measured by comparing 
the time of the climb to that of all other firefighters. This might be expressed in what 
many call a bell curve. Or it could be evaluated with reference
to set criteria, such as carrying a certain amount 
of weight a certain distance up a certain number of stairs. Similarly, the diplomat might be measured
against other test-taking diplomats, or against a set of fixed criteria, which demonstrate different levels
of language proficiency. And all of these results can be expressed
using something called a percentile. If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile,
70% of test takers scored below her. If she scored in the 30th percentile,
70% of test takers scored above her. Although standardized tests 
are sometimes controversial, they're simply a tool. As a thought experiment, 
think of a standardized test as a ruler. A ruler's usefulness 
depends on two things. First, the job we ask it to do. Our ruler can't measure 
the temperature outside or how loud someone is singing. Second, the ruler's usefulness depends
on its design. Say you need to measure the circumference
of an orange. Our ruler measures length,
which is the right quantity, but it hasn't been designed with the 
flexibility required for the task at hand. So, if standardized tests are given
the wrong job, or aren't designed properly, they may end up measuring
the wrong things. In the case of schools, students with test anxiety may have 
trouble performing their best on a standardized test, not because they don't know the answers, but because they're feeling too nervous
to share what they've learned. Students with reading challenges may struggle with the wording 
of a math problem, so their test results may better reflect
their literacy rather than numeracy skills. And students who were confused by examples on tests that contain 
unfamiliar cultural references may do poorly, telling us more about the test taker's
cultural familiarity than their academic learning. In these cases, the tests may need
to be designed differently. Standardized tests can also 
have a hard time measuring abstract 
characteristics or skills, such as creativity, critical thinking,
and collaboration. If we design a test poorly, or ask it to do the wrong job, or a job it's not very good at, the results may not be reliable or valid. Reliability and validity 
are two critical ideas for understanding standardized tests. To understand the difference between them, we can use the metaphor 
of two broken thermometers. An unreliable thermometer gives you a different reading 
each time you take your temperature, and the reliable but invalid thermometer
is consistently ten degrees too hot. Validity also depends on accurate
interpretations of results. If people say results of a test
mean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler
to tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone
to reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle
a tough situation, or how brave a firefighter 
might turn out to be. So standardized tests may help us learn
a little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot
about a single person. Many social scientists worry about
test scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes
for test takers, sometimes with long-term 
life consequences. We can't blame the tests, though. It's up to us to use the right tests
for the right jobs, and to interpret results appropriately.

**Transcript**:
On January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln legally changed the status
of over 3 million enslaved blacks across ten states from slave to free. His Emancipation Proclamation 
wasn't a law, or a presidential decree. It was an executive order. The framers of the American Constitution
made the power of executive order available to the executive branch. But what exactly is this tool? How does it work? And what is the extent of its power? Well, an executive order isn't a law,
but it can carry the weight of one. Passing laws involves 
a fairly lengthy process. First, a member of Congress proposes
a piece of legislation in the form of a bill. After many committees and revisions, if the bill is approved 
by a majority votes in Congress, that is both the House and Senate, the bill is then sent to 
the president for signature. If the president signs the bill,
it then becomes a law. An executive order, on the other hand, is something the president issues
without consultation or permission from Congress. They are, however, enforced like laws, and are subject to judicial review
by the court system to make sure they're within the limits
of the Constitution. That means the courts have the power
to invalidate any executive decisions that they determine are an overreach of
the president in trying to assert power. And once the president leaves office, if his or her successor wants to eliminate
the executive order, they can do so. So when does a president 
use an executive order? Sometimes a president feels the need to
exert power without working with Congress, and in times of crisis, quick decisions
can be justified. But most executive orders are not 
responses to emergencies. They're often directed towards
agencies in the federal government in order to expand 
or contract their power. Others determine the extent
to which legislation should be enforced. And sometimes, a president may use
an executive order to clarify and help implement a policy
that needs to be easily defined. Some of the most famous executive orders have changed the course 
of American history. FDR issued an executive order to establish
the Works Progress Administration, which helped build thousands of roads,
bridges, and parks throughout the country. The WPA also employed 
thousands of writers, painters, sculptors, and artists to create works of art
in public spaces. Additionally, Harry Truman used
an executive order to desegregate the armed forces in 1948. And in 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed
an executive order to establish requirements 
for nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and employment. Executive orders have often been used
in positive and inclusive ways, but they've also been used 
to exclude and divide. One of the most notable examples being
FDR's 1942 executive order. He gave the military authority to target
predominantly Japanese-Americans, as well as German-Americans
and Italian-Americans, in certain regions across the country. This executive order also removed any or
all of those people into military zones, most commonly known as internment camps. Beginning in the early 1960s, each president has issued 
roughly 300 executive orders, but FDR issued over 3,500. At the other end of the spectrum, William Henry Harrison never issued
an executive order, probably because his presidency only
lasted 31 days. The U.S. Constitution is somewhat ambiguous
on the extent of the president's power. That's resulted in executive orders
expanding over time. For instance, since Lyndon Johnson, presidents have begun issuing orders
to create faith-based initiatives, establish federal agencies, and remove barriers 
for scientific research. There are checks and balances 
in the U.S. political system. Congress can pass laws to counteract
executive orders, and judges can halt them by deeming them
unconstitutional. But in the time it takes 
for those things to happen, an executive order can go into effect and possibly change the course of history,
for better or for worse.

responses to emergencies. They're often directed towards
agencies in the federal government in order to expand 
or contract their power. Others determine the extent
to which legislation should be enforced. And sometimes, a president may use
an executive order to clarify and help implement a policy
that needs to be easily defined. Some of the most famous executive orders have changed the course 
of American history. FDR issued an executive order to establish
the Works Progress Administration, which helped build thousands of roads,
bridges, and parks throughout the country. The WPA also employed 
thousands of writers, painters, sculptors, and artists to create works of art
in public spaces. Additionally, Harry Truman used
an executive order to desegregate the armed forces in 1948. And in 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed
an executive order to establish requirements 
for nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and employment. Executive orders have often been used
in positive and inclusive ways, but they've also been used 
to exclude and divide. One of the most notable examples being
FDR's 1942 executive order. He gave the military authority to target
predominantly Japanese-Americans, as well as German-Americans
and Italian-Americans, in certain regions across the country. This executive order also removed any or
all of those people into military zones, most commonly known as internment camps. Beginning in the early 1960s, each president has issued 
roughly 300 executive orders, but FDR issued over 3,500. At the other end of the spectrum, William Henry Harrison never issued
an executive order, probably because his presidency only
lasted 31 days. The U.S. Constitution is somewhat ambiguous
on the extent of the president's power. That's resulted in executive orders
expanding over time. For instance, since Lyndon Johnson, presidents have begun issuing orders
to create faith-based initiatives, establish federal agencies, and remove barriers 
for scientific research. There are checks and balances 
in the U.S. political system. Congress can pass laws to counteract
executive orders, and judges can halt them by deeming them
unconstitutional. But in the time it takes 
for those things to happen, an executive order can go into effect and possibly change the course of history,
for better or for worse.

**Transcript**:
On January 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln legally changed the status
of over 3 million enslaved blacks across ten states from slave to free. His Emancipation Proclamation 
wasn't a law, or a presidential decree. It was an executive order. The framers of the American Constitution
made the power of executive order available to the executive branch. But what exactly is this tool? How does it work? And what is the extent of its power? Well, an executive order isn't a law,
but it can carry the weight of one. Passing laws involves 
a fairly lengthy process. First, a member of Congress proposes
a piece of legislation in the form of a bill. After many committees and revisions, if the bill is approved 
by a majority votes in Congress, that is both the House and Senate, the bill is then sent to 
the president for signature. If the president signs the bill,
it then becomes a law. An executive order, on the other hand, is something the president issues
without consultation or permission from Congress. They are, however, enforced like laws, and are subject to judicial review
by the court system to make sure they're within the limits
of the Constitution. That means the courts have the power
to invalidate any executive decisions that they determine are an overreach of
the president in trying to assert power. And once the president leaves office, if his or her successor wants to eliminate
the executive order, they can do so. So when does a president 
use an executive order? Sometimes a president feels the need to
exert power without working with Congress, and in times of crisis, quick decisions
can be justified. But most executive orders are not 
responses to emergencies. They're often directed towards
agencies in the federal government in order to expand 
or contract their power. Others determine the extent
to which legislation should be enforced. And sometimes, a president may use
an executive order to clarify and help implement a policy
that needs to be easily defined. Some of the most famous executive orders have changed the course

**Transcript**:
At about six o'clock in the morning
on September 14, 2015, scientists witnessed something
no human had ever seen: two black holes colliding. Both about 30 times as massive
as our Sun, they had been orbiting each other
for millions of years. As they got closer together, they circled each other faster and faster. Finally, they collided and merged
into a single, even bigger, black hole. A fraction of a second before their crash, they sent a vibration across the universe
at the speed of light. And on Earth, billions of years later, a detector called the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory, or LIGO for short, picked it up. The signal only lasted a fifth of a second and was the detector's first observation
of gravitational waves. What are these ripples in space? The answer starts with gravity, the force that pulls any 
two objects together. That's the case for everything
In the observable universe. You're pulling on the Earth,
the Moon, the Sun, and every single star, and they're pulling on you. The more mass something has,
the stronger its gravitational pull. The farther away the object,
the lower its pull. If every mass has an effect
on every other mass in the universe, no matter how small, then changes in gravity can tell us
about what those objects are doing. Fluctuations in the gravity
coming from the universe are called gravitational waves. Gravitational waves move out from 
what caused them, like ripples on a pond, getting smaller as they travel farther
from their center. But what are they ripples on? When Einstein devised 
his Theory of Relativity, he imagined gravity as a curve
in a surface called space-time. A mass in space creates a depression
in space-time, and a ball rolling across a depression
will curve like it's being attracted 
to the other mass. The bigger the mass, the deeper the depression
and the stronger the gravity. When the mass making the depression moves,
that sends out ripples in space-time. These are gravitationl waves. What would a gravitational wave feel like? If our bodies were sensitive enough
to detect them, we'd feel like we were 
being stretched sideways while being compressed vertically. And in the next instant, stretched up and down 
while being compressed horizontally, sideways, then up and down. This back and forth would happen
over and over as the gravitational wave
passed right through you. But this happens on such a minute scale
that we can't feel any of it. So we've built detectors 
that can feel it for us. That's what the LIGO detectors do. And they're not the only ones. There are gravitational wave detectors
spread across the world. These L-shaped instruments have long arms, whose exact length 
is measured with lasers. If the length changes, it could be because
gravitational waves are stretching and compressing the arms. Once the detectors feel 
a gravitational wave, scientists can extract information
about the wave's source. In a way, detectors like LIGO are
big gravitational wave radios. Radio waves are traveling all around you,
but you can't feel them or hear the music they carry. It takes the right kind of 
detector to extract the music. LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal, which scientists then study for data
about the object that generated it. They can derive information, 
like its mass and the shape of its orbit. We can also hear gravitational waves
by playing their signals through speakers, just like the music a radio extracts
from radio waves. So those two black holes colliding
sounds like this. Scientists call this 
slide whistle-like noise a chirp, and it's the signature of any two
objects orbiting into each other. The black hole collision 
was just one example of what gravitational waves can tell us. Other high-energy astronomical events
will leave gravitational echoes, too. The collapse of a star before it
explodes in a supernova, or a very dense neutron stars colliding. Every time we create a new tool
to look at space, we discover something we didn't expect, something that might revolutionize
our understanding of the universe. LIGO's no different. In the short time it's been on, LIGO's already revealed surprises, like that black holes collide
more often than we ever expected. It's impossible to say, 
but exciting to imagine, what revelations may now be propagating
across space towards our tiny blue planet and
its new way of perceiving the universe.

**Transcript**:
At about six o'clock in the morning
on September 14, 2015, scientists witnessed something
no human had ever seen: two black holes colliding. Both about 30 times as massive
as our Sun, they had been orbiting each other
for millions of years. As they got closer together, they circled each other faster and faster. Finally, they collided and merged
into a single, even bigger, black hole. A fraction of a second before their crash, they sent a vibration across the universe
at the speed of light. And on Earth, billions of years later, a detector called the Laser Interferometer
Gravitational Wave Observatory, or LIGO for short, picked it up. The signal only lasted a fifth of a second and was the detector's first observation
of gravitational waves. What are these ripples in space? The answer starts with gravity, the force that pulls any 
two objects together. That's the case for everything
In the observable universe. You're pulling on the Earth,
the Moon, the Sun, and every single star, and they're pulling on you. The more mass something has,
the stronger its gravitational pull. The farther away the object,
the lower its pull. If every mass has an effect
on every other mass in the universe, no matter how small, then changes in gravity can tell us
about what those objects are doing. Fluctuations in the gravity
coming from the universe are called gravitational waves. Gravitational waves move out from 
what caused them, like ripples on a pond, getting smaller as they travel farther
from their center. But what are they ripples on? When Einstein devised 
his Theory of Relativity, he imagined gravity as a curve
in a surface called space-time. A mass in space creates a depression
in space-time, and a ball rolling across a depression
will curve like it's being attracted 
to the other mass. The bigger the mass, the deeper the depression
and the stronger the gravity. When the mass making the depression moves,
that sends out ripples in space-time. These are gravitationl waves. What would a gravitational wave feel like? If our bodies were sensitive enough
to detect them, we'd feel like we were 
being stretched sideways while being compressed vertically. And in the next instant, stretched up and down 
while being compressed horizontally, sideways, then up and down. This back and forth would happen
over and over as the gravitational wave
passed right through you. But this happens on such a minute scale
that we can't feel any of it. So we've built detectors 
that can feel it for us. That's what the LIGO detectors do. And they're not the only ones. There are gravitational wave detectors
spread across the world. These L-shaped instruments have long arms, whose exact length 
is measured with lasers. If the length changes, it could be because
gravitational waves are stretching and compressing the arms. Once the detectors feel 
a gravitational wave, scientists can extract information
about the wave's source. In a way, detectors like LIGO are
big gravitational wave radios. Radio waves are traveling all around you,
but you can't feel them or hear the music they carry. It takes the right kind of 
detector to extract the music. LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal, which scientists then study for data
about the object that generated it. They can derive information, 
like its mass and the shape of its orbit. We can also hear gravitational waves
by playing their signals through speakers, just like the music a radio extracts
from radio waves. So those two black holes colliding
sounds like this. Scientists call this 
slide whistle-like noise a chirp, and it's the signature of any two
objects orbiting into each other. The black hole collision 
was just one example of what gravitational waves can tell us. Other high-energy astronomical events
will leave gravitational echoes, too. The collapse of a star before it
explodes in a supernova, or a very dense neutron stars colliding. Every time we create a new tool
to look at space, we discover something we didn't expect, something that might revolutionize
our understanding of the universe. LIGO's no different. In the short time it's been on, LIGO's already revealed surprises, like that black holes collide

**Transcript**:
Every year, about 1,000 new words are
added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it 
into our everyday lives? With over 170,000 words currently in use
in the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps
in what we want to express and we fill those gaps 
in several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways. One way is to absorb a word
from another language. English has borrowed so many words
over its history that nearly half of its vocabulary 
comes directly from other languages. Sometimes, this is simply because
the thing the word describes was borrowed itself. Rome and France brought legal
and religious concepts, like altar and jury, to Medieval England, while trade brought crops and cuisine, like Arabic coffee, Italian spaghetti, and Indian curry. But sometimes, another language 
has just the right word for a complex idea or emotion, like naïveté machismo, or schadenfreude. Scientists also use classical languages
to name new concepts. Clone, for example, was derived from
the Ancient Greek word for twig to describe creating a new plant
from a piece of the old. And today, the process works both ways, with English lending words like software
to languages all over the world. Another popular way 
to fill a vocabulary gap is by combining existing words that each
convey part of the new concept. This can be done by combining two
whole words into a compound word, like airport or starfish, or by clipping and blending parts of words
together, like spork, brunch, or internet. And unlike borrowings 
from other languages, these can often be understood
the first time you hear them. And sometimes a new word isn't new at all. Obsolete words gain new life by adopting
new meanings. Villain originally meant a peasant farmer,
but in a twist of aristocratic snobbery came to mean someone not bound
by the knightly code of chivalry and, therefore, a bad person. A geek went from 
being a carnival performer to any strange person to a specific type of awkward genius. And other times, words come to mean
their opposite through irony, metaphor, or misuse, like when sick or wicked are used
to describe something literally amazing. But if words can be formed 
in all these ways, why do some become mainstream
while others fall out of use or never catch on in the first place? Sometimes, the answer is simple, as when scientists or companies 
give an official name to a new discovery or technology. And some countries have language academies
to make the decisions. But for the most part, official sources
like dictionaries only document current usage. New words don't originate from above,
but from ordinary people spreading words that 
hit the right combination of useful and catchy. Take the word meme, coined in the 1970s 
by sociobiologist Richard Dawkins from the Ancient Greek for imitation. He used it to describe how ideas
and symbols propagate through a culture like genes through a population. With the advent of the Internet, the process became directly observable
in how jokes and images were popularized at lightning speed. And soon, the word came to refer
to a certain kind of image. So meme not only describes how words
become part of language, the word is a meme itself. And there's a word for this phenomenon
of words that describe themselves: autological. Not all new words are created equal. Some stick around for millennia, some adapt to changing times, and others die off. Some relay information, some interpret it, but the way these words are created and the journey they take to become
part of our speech tells us a lot about our world
and how we communicate within it.

**Transcript**:
Every year, about 1,000 new words are
added to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it 
into our everyday lives? With over 170,000 words currently in use
in the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps
in what we want to express and we fill those gaps 
in several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways. One way is to absorb a word
from another language. English has borrowed so many words
over its history that nearly half of its vocabulary 
comes directly from other languages. Sometimes, this is simply because
the thing the word describes was borrowed itself. Rome and France brought legal
and religious concepts, like altar and jury, to Medieval England, while trade brought crops and cuisine, like Arabic coffee, Italian spaghetti, and Indian curry. But sometimes, another language 
has just the right word for a complex idea or emotion, like naïveté machismo, or schadenfreude. Scientists also use classical languages
to name new concepts. Clone, for example, was derived from
the Ancient Greek word for twig to describe creating a new plant
from a piece of the old. And today, the process works both ways, with English lending words like software
to languages all over the world. Another popular way 
to fill a vocabulary gap is by combining existing words that each
convey part of the new concept. This can be done by combining two
whole words into a compound word, like airport or starfish, or by clipping and blending parts of words
together, like spork, brunch, or internet. And unlike borrowings 
from other languages, these can often be understood
the first time you hear them. And sometimes a new word isn't new at all. Obsolete words gain new life by adopting
new meanings. Villain originally meant a peasant farmer,
but in a twist of aristocratic snobbery came to mean someone not bound
by the knightly code of chivalry and, therefore, a bad person. A geek went from 
being a carnival performer to any strange person to a specific type of awkward genius. And other times, words come to mean
their opposite through irony, metaphor, or misuse, like when sick or wicked are used
to describe something literally amazing. But if words can be formed 
in all these ways, why do some become mainstream
while others fall out of use or never catch on in the first place? Sometimes, the answer is simple, as when scientists or companies 
give an official name to a new discovery or technology. And some countries have language academies
to make the decisions. But for the most part, official sources
like dictionaries only document current usage. New words don't originate from above,
but from ordinary people spreading words that 
hit the right combination of useful and catchy. Take the word meme, coined in the 1970s 
by sociobiologist Richard Dawkins from the Ancient Greek for imitation. He used it to describe how ideas
and symbols propagate through a culture like genes through a population. With the advent of the Internet, the process became directly observable
in how jokes and images were popularized at lightning speed. And soon, the word came to refer
to a certain kind of image. So meme not only describes how words
become part of language, the word is a meme itself. And there's a word for this phenomenon
of words that describe themselves: autological. Not all new words are created equal. Some stick around for millennia, some adapt to changing times, and others die off. Some relay information, some interpret it, but the way these words are created and the journey they take to become
part of our speech tells us a lot about our world
and how we communicate within it.

**Transcript**:
Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy
two billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common
garments in the world. But how and where is the average
t-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life
on a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and
grown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest
these puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically
separates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed 
into 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity
of water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce
the average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides
and pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton
grown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons 
of cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them
to a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into
snowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets 
of rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals
until they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into
commercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring
in about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain
cancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals
can cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water
in rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced
in some countries that the entire process of growing
and producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth 
travels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,
or Turkey, human labor is still required 
to stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that 
machines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's
biggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people
in the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions
and low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts
travel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton 
an enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce 
their own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts
for 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's
willingness to buy boosted global production 
from 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most
resource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly
400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers 
both use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times
more than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing 
consumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations
and the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable 
human labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second
largest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from
recycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry
to save resources. Instead of throwing them away
at the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them
as cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing
will you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined 
impact on the world?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy
two billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common
garments in the world. But how and where is the average
t-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life
on a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and
grown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest
these puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically
separates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed 
into 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity
of water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce
the average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides
and pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton
grown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons 
of cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them
to a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into
snowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets 
of rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals
until they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into
commercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring
in about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain
cancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals
can cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water
in rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced
in some countries that the entire process of growing
and producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth 
travels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,
or Turkey, human labor is still required 
to stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that 
machines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's
biggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people
in the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions
and low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts
travel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton 
an enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce 
their own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts
for 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's
willingness to buy boosted global production 
from 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most
resource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly
400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers 
both use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times
more than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing 
consumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations
and the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable 
human labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second
largest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from

**Transcript**:
"Beauty is a curse," Psyche thought as she looked over the cliff's edge
where she'd been abandoned by her father. She'd been born with the physical
perfection so complete that she was worshipped as a new
incarnation of Venus, the goddess of love. But real-life human lovers were
too intimidated even to approach her. When her father asked for guidance
from the Oracle of Apollo, the god of light, reason, and prophecy. He was told to abandon his daughter
on a rocky crag where she would marry a cruel
and savage serpent-like winged evil. Alone on the crag, Psyche felt
Zephyr the West Wind gently lifting her into the air. It set her down before a palace. "You are home," she heard 
an unseen voice say. "Your husband awaits you
in the bedroom, if you dare to meet him." She was brave enough, Psyche told herself. The bedroom was so dark that she
couldn't see her husband. But he didn't feel serpent-like at all. His skin was soft,
and his voice and manner were gentle. She asked him who he was, but he told her this was the one question
he could never answer. If she loved him, 
she would not need to know. His visits continued night after night. Before long, Psyche was pregnant. She rejoiced, but was also conflicted. How could she raise her baby
with a man she'd never seen? That night, Psyche approached
her sleeping husband holding an oil lamp. What she found was the god Cupid who sent gods and humans 
lusting after each other with the pinpricks of his arrows. Psyche dropped her lamp,
burning Cupid with hot oil. He said he'd been in love with Psyche
ever since his jealous mother, Venus, asked him to embarrass the young woman
by pricking her with an arrow. But taken with Psyche's beauty, Cupid
used the arrow on himself. He didn't believe, however, that gods
and humans could love as equals. Now that she knew his true form,
their hopes for happiness were dashed, so he flew away. Psyche was left in despair until
the unseen voice returned and told her that it was indeed possible for her and Cupid 
to love each other as equals. Encouraged, she set out to find him. But Venus intercepted Psyche and said
she and Cupid could only wed if she completed a series 
of impossible tasks. First, Psyche was told to sort a huge,
messy pile of seeds in a single night. Just as she was abandoning hope, an ant colony took pity on her
and helped with the work. Successfully passing the first trial, Psyche next had to bring Venus
the fleece of the golden sheep, who had a reputation for 
disemboweling stray adventurers, but a river god showed her how to collect the fleece the sheep 
had snagged on briars, and she succeeded. Finally, Psyche had to travel
to the Underworld and convince Proserpina, 
queen of the dead, to put a drop of her beauty in a box
for Venus. Once again, the unseen voice came
to Psyche's aide. It told her to bring barley cakes for
Cerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld and coins to pay the boatman, Charon
to ferry her across the river Styx. With her third and final task complete, Psyche returned to the land of the living. Just outside Venus's palace, she opened
the box of Proserpina's beauty, hoping to keep some for herself. But the box was filled with sleep,
not beauty, and Psyche collapsed in the road. Cupid, now recovered from his wounds,
flew to his sleeping bride. He told her he'd been wrong and foolish. Her fearlessness in the face
of the unknown proved that she was more than his equal. Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar
of the gods, making her immortal. Shortly after, Psyche bore their daughter. They named her Pleasure, and she, Cupid, and Psyche, 
whose name means soul, have been complicating people's
love lives ever since.

of impossible tasks. First, Psyche was told to sort a huge,
messy pile of seeds in a single night. Just as she was abandoning hope, an ant colony took pity on her
and helped with the work. Successfully passing the first trial, Psyche next had to bring Venus
the fleece of the golden sheep, who had a reputation for 
disemboweling stray adventurers, but a river god showed her how to collect the fleece the sheep 
had snagged on briars, and she succeeded. Finally, Psyche had to travel
to the Underworld and convince Proserpina, 
queen of the dead, to put a drop of her beauty in a box
for Venus. Once again, the unseen voice came
to Psyche's aide. It told her to bring barley cakes for
Cerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld and coins to pay the boatman, Charon
to ferry her across the river Styx. With her third and final task complete, Psyche returned to the land of the living. Just outside Venus's palace, she opened
the box of Proserpina's beauty, hoping to keep some for herself. But the box was filled with sleep,
not beauty, and Psyche collapsed in the road. Cupid, now recovered from his wounds,
flew to his sleeping bride. He told her he'd been wrong and foolish. Her fearlessness in the face
of the unknown proved that she was more than his equal. Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar
of the gods, making her immortal. Shortly after, Psyche bore their daughter. They named her Pleasure, and she, Cupid, and Psyche, 
whose name means soul, have been complicating people's
love lives ever since.

**Transcript**:
Behold the human brain, it's lumpy landscape visibly split into
a left and right side. This structure has inspired one of 
the most pervasive ideas about the brain, that the left side controls logic and the right, creativity. And yet, this is a myth unsupported
by scientific evidence. So how did this misleading idea
come about, and what does it get wrong? It's true that the brain has a right
and a left side. This is most apparent 
with the outer layer, or the cortex. Internal regions, like the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue, but in fact, they're also organized
with left and right sides. The left and the right sides of the brain
do control different body functions, such as movement and sight. The brain's right side controls the motion
of the left arm and leg and vice versa. The visual system is even more complex. Each eye has a left 
and right visual field. Both left visual fields are sent
to the right side of the brain, and both right fields 
are sent to the left side. So the brain uses both sides to make
a complete image of the world. Scientists don't know for sure
why we have that crossing over. One theory is it began soon after animals
developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage
of quicker reflexes. If an animal sees a predator coming
from its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. So we can say that vision 
and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend
that idea to logic and creativity. This misconception began in 
the mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems
communicating due to injuries. The researchers found damage to
the patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is
controlled by the left side of the brain. That captured the popular imagination. Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea 
of a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional 
right hemisphere represented by his characters
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But this idea didn't hold up when doctors
and scientists examined patients who were missing
a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. These patients showed a complete
range of behaviors, both logical and creative. Later research showed that one side
of the brain is more active than the other for some functions. Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system
rather than by person. There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant 
sides of the brain, or to support the idea 
of a left-right split between logic and creativity. Some people may be particularly logical
or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides
of their brains. And even the idea of logic and creativity
being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. Solving complex math problems requires
inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art
have intricate logical frameworks. Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain
functioning as one.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Over 100,000 metric tons
of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight
of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed
in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,
focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,
and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where
it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves
and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,
as it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember
and revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a
stimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of
the body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply
of energy, which it gets by breaking down
a high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,
ATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors
perfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade 
of biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important
brain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine
receptor antagonist. That means it derails this process
of slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar
molecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into
the adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, 
adenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,
so it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors 
for another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain
is to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these
paired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine
to fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,
it doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects
on adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,
reducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
and some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's
ability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes 
an unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below
a certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects
are so helpful. It might make you feel better
and more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate
and blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages
caffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body
that have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular
consumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors 
are perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job
of signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need
to consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine
receptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly 
quit caffeine, you may experience 
an unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors 
and no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine
receptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's
most popular stimulant.

**Transcript**:
Over 100,000 metric tons
of caffeine are consumed around the world every year. That's equivalent to the weight
of 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed
in coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,
focused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,
and make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where
it serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves
and seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,

**Transcript**:
A toothpaste brand claims
their product will destroy more plaque than any product ever made. A politician tells you their plan
will create the most jobs. We're so used to hearing these
kinds of exaggerations in advertising and politics that we might not even bat an eye. But what about when the claim
is accompanied by a graph? Afterall, a graph isn't an opinion. It represents cold, hard numbers,
and who can argue with those? Yet, as it turns out, there are plenty
of ways graphs can mislead and outright manipulate. Here are some things to look out for. In this 1992 ad, Chevy claimed to make
the most reliable trucks in America using this graph. Not only does it show that 98% of all
Chevy trucks sold in the last ten years are still on the road, but it looks like they're twice
as dependable as Toyota trucks. That is, until you take a closer look
at the numbers on the left and see that the figure for Toyota
is about 96.5%. The scale only goes between 95 and 100%. If it went from 0 to 100,
it would look like this. This is one of the most common
ways graphs misrepresent data, by distorting the scale. Zooming in on a small portion
of the y-axis exaggerates a barely detectable difference
between the things being compared. And it's especially misleading 
with bar graphs since we assume the difference
in the size of the bars is proportional to the values. But the scale can also be distorted
along the x-axis, usually in line graphs
showing something changing over time. This chart showing the rise
in American unemployment from 2008 to 2010 manipulates the x-axis in two ways. First of all, the scale is inconsistent, compressing the 15-month span
after March 2009 to look shorter than 
the preceding six months. Using more consistent data points
gives a different picture with job losses tapering off
by the end of 2009. And if you wonder why
they were increasing in the first place, the timeline starts immediately after
the U.S.'s biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. These techniques are known as
cherry picking. A time range can be carefully chosen
to exclude the impact of a major event right outside it. And picking specific data points
can hide important changes in between. Even when there's nothing wrong
with the graph itself, leaving out relevant data can give
a misleading impression. This chart of how many people watch
the Super Bowl each year makes it look like the event's
popularity is exploding. But it's not accounting 
for population growth. The ratings have actually held steady because while the number 
of football fans has increased, their share of overall viewership has not. Finally, a graph can't tell you much if you don't know the full significance 
of what's being presented. Both of the following graphs
use the same ocean temperature data from the National Centers 
for Environmental Information. So why do they seem to give
opposite impressions? The first graph plots the average
annual ocean temperature from 1880 to 2016, making the change look insignificant. But in fact, a rise of even
half a degree Celsius can cause massive ecological disruption. This is why the second graph, which show the average temperature
variation each year, is far more significant. When they're used well, graphs can
help us intuitively grasp complex data. But as visual software has enabled
more usage of graphs throughout all media, it's also made them easier to use
in a careless or dishonest way. So the next time you see a graph,
don't be swayed by the lines and curves. Look at the labels, the numbers, the scale, and the context, and ask what story the picture
is trying to tell.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Distorting the scale on a graph is one of the most common methods of presenting which of the following form(s) of misleading information?

**Transcript**:
A toothpaste brand claims
their product will destroy more plaque than any product ever made. A politician tells you their plan
will create the most jobs. We're so used to hearing these
kinds of exaggerations in advertising and politics that we might not even bat an eye. But what about when the claim
is accompanied by a graph? Afterall, a graph isn't an opinion. It represents cold, hard numbers,
and who can argue with those? Yet, as it turns out, there are plenty
of ways graphs can mislead and outright manipulate. Here are some things to look out for. In this 1992 ad, Chevy claimed to make
the most reliable trucks in America using this graph. Not only does it show that 98% of all
Chevy trucks sold in the last ten years are still on the road, but it looks like they're twice
as dependable as Toyota trucks. That is, until you take a closer look
at the numbers on the left and see that the figure for Toyota
is about 96.5%. The scale only goes between 95 and 100%. If it went from 0 to 100,
it would look like this. This is one of the most common
ways graphs misrepresent data, by distorting the scale. Zooming in on a small portion
of the y-axis exaggerates a barely detectable difference
between the things being compared. And it's especially misleading 
with bar graphs since we assume the difference
in the size of the bars is proportional to the values. But the scale can also be distorted
along the x-axis, usually in line graphs
showing something changing over time. This chart showing the rise
in American unemployment from 2008 to 2010 manipulates the x-axis in two ways. First of all, the scale is inconsistent, compressing the 15-month span
after March 2009 to look shorter than 
the preceding six months. Using more consistent data points
gives a different picture with job losses tapering off
by the end of 2009. And if you wonder why
they were increasing in the first place, the timeline starts immediately after
the U.S.'s biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. These techniques are known as
cherry picking. A time range can be carefully chosen
to exclude the impact of a major event right outside it. And picking specific data points
can hide important changes in between. Even when there's nothing wrong
with the graph itself, leaving out relevant data can give
a misleading impression. This chart of how many people watch
the Super Bowl each year makes it look like the event's
popularity is exploding. But it's not accounting 
for population growth. The ratings have actually held steady because while the number 
of football fans has increased, their share of overall viewership has not. Finally, a graph can't tell you much if you don't know the full significance 
of what's being presented. Both of the following graphs
use the same ocean temperature data from the National Centers 
for Environmental Information. So why do they seem to give
opposite impressions? The first graph plots the average
annual ocean temperature from 1880 to 2016, making the change look insignificant. But in fact, a rise of even
half a degree Celsius can cause massive ecological disruption. This is why the second graph, which show the average temperature
variation each year, is far more significant. When they're used well, graphs can
help us intuitively grasp complex data. But as visual software has enabled
more usage of graphs throughout all media, it's also made them easier to use
in a careless or dishonest way. So the next time you see a graph,
don't be swayed by the lines and curves. Look at the labels, the numbers, the scale, and the context, and ask what story the picture
is trying to tell.

**Transcript**:
The biggest kidney stone on record
weighed more than a kilogram and was 17 centimeters in diameter. The patient didn't actually
swallow a stone the size of a coconut. Kidney stones form inside the body, but unfortunately, they're extremely
painful to get out. A kidney stone is a hard mass
of crystals that can form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine contains compounds 
that consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, oxalate, uric acid, and phosphate. If the levels of these particles
get too high, or if urine becomes too acidic
or basic, the particles can clump together
and crystallize. Unless the problem is addressed, the crystals will gradually grow
over a few weeks, months, or even years, forming a detectable stone. Calcium oxalate is the most common
type of crystal to form this way, and accounts for about 
80% of kidney stones. Less common kidney stones are made
of calcium phosphate, or uric acid. A slightly different type of stone made of the minerals magnesium
ammonium phosphate, or struvite, can be caused by bacterial infection. And even rarer stones can result
from genetic disorders or certain medications. A kidney stone can go undetected
until it starts to move. When a stone travels
through the kidney and into the ureter, its sharp edges scratch
the walls of the urinary tract. Nerve endings embedded in this tissue
transmit excruciating pain signals through the nervous system. And the scratches can send blood flowing
into the urine. This can be accompanied 
by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough
to actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection,
or back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones 
don't become this serious, or even require invasive treatment. Masses less than five millimeters
in diameter will usually pass out 
of the body on their own. A doctor will often simply recommend
drinking large amounts of water to help speed the process along, and maybe taking some pain killers. If the stone is slightly larger,
medications like alpha blockers can help by relaxing the muscles
in the ureter and making it easier 
for the stone to get through. Another medication called
potassium citrate can help dissolve the stones by creating
a less acidic urine. For medium-sized stones up to about
ten millimeters, one option is pulverizing them
with soundwaves. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
uses high-intensity pulses of focused ultrasonic energy
aimed directly at the stone. The pulses create vibrations inside
the stone itself and small bubbles jostle it. These combined forces crush the stone
into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body more easily. But zapping a stone with sound
doesn't work as well if it's simply too big. So sometimes, more invasive
treatments are necessary. A rigid tube called a stent
can be placed in the ureter to expand it. Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses
to break up the stone. Stones can also be surgically removed
through an incision in the patient's back or groin. What about just avoiding kidney stones
in the first place? For people prone to them, their doctor may recommend
drinking plenty of water, which dilutes the calcium oxalate
and other compounds that eventually build up 
into painful stones. Foods like potato chips, spinach, rhubarb, and beets are high in oxalate, so doctors might advise limiting them. Even though calcium 
is often found in stones, calcium in foods and beverages
can actually help by binding to oxalate 
in the digestive tract before it can be absorbed
and reach the kidneys. If you do end up with a kidney stone,
you're not alone. Data suggests that rates are rising, but that world record probably
won't be broken any time soon.

**Transcript**:
The biggest kidney stone on record
weighed more than a kilogram and was 17 centimeters in diameter. The patient didn't actually
swallow a stone the size of a coconut. Kidney stones form inside the body, but unfortunately, they're extremely
painful to get out. A kidney stone is a hard mass
of crystals that can form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine contains compounds 
that consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, oxalate, uric acid, and phosphate. If the levels of these particles
get too high, or if urine becomes too acidic
or basic, the particles can clump together
and crystallize. Unless the problem is addressed, the crystals will gradually grow
over a few weeks, months, or even years, forming a detectable stone. Calcium oxalate is the most common
type of crystal to form this way, and accounts for about 
80% of kidney stones. Less common kidney stones are made
of calcium phosphate, or uric acid. A slightly different type of stone made of the minerals magnesium
ammonium phosphate, or struvite, can be caused by bacterial infection. And even rarer stones can result
from genetic disorders or certain medications. A kidney stone can go undetected
until it starts to move. When a stone travels
through the kidney and into the ureter, its sharp edges scratch
the walls of the urinary tract. Nerve endings embedded in this tissue
transmit excruciating pain signals through the nervous system. And the scratches can send blood flowing
into the urine. This can be accompanied 
by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough
to actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection,
or back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones 
don't become this serious, or even require invasive treatment. Masses less than five millimeters
in diameter will usually pass out 
of the body on their own. A doctor will often simply recommend
drinking large amounts of water to help speed the process along, and maybe taking some pain killers. If the stone is slightly larger,
medications like alpha blockers can help by relaxing the muscles
in the ureter and making it easier 
for the stone to get through. Another medication called
potassium citrate can help dissolve the stones by creating
a less acidic urine. For medium-sized stones up to about
ten millimeters, one option is pulverizing them
with soundwaves. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy
uses high-intensity pulses of focused ultrasonic energy
aimed directly at the stone. The pulses create vibrations inside
the stone itself and small bubbles jostle it. These combined forces crush the stone
into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body more easily. But zapping a stone with sound
doesn't work as well if it's simply too big. So sometimes, more invasive
treatments are necessary. A rigid tube called a stent
can be placed in the ureter to expand it. Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses
to break up the stone. Stones can also be surgically removed
through an incision in the patient's back or groin. What about just avoiding kidney stones
in the first place? For people prone to them, their doctor may recommend
drinking plenty of water, which dilutes the calcium oxalate
and other compounds that eventually build up 
into painful stones. Foods like potato chips, spinach, rhubarb, and beets are high in oxalate, so doctors might advise limiting them. Even though calcium 
is often found in stones, calcium in foods and beverages
can actually help by binding to oxalate 
in the digestive tract before it can be absorbed
and reach the kidneys. If you do end up with a kidney stone,
you're not alone. Data suggests that rates are rising, but that world record probably
won't be broken any time soon.

**Transcript**:
This is a 20-minute VHS tape about a LEGO
character called Jack Stone. When it came out in 2001, it was the first
real computer-animated Lego movie. … but it hasn’t aged that well. "Incredible!" "Fantastic." Thirteen years later, The Lego Movie looked
like this: Let’s watch that again. This is 2001. "There you have it." And this is 2014. "Yes, that's me." That is a huge difference. Here’s how they made it happen. “My name is Grant Freckelton, I’m a production
designer at Animal Logic.” He’s overseen the animation style of movies
like Legend of the Guardians, 300, and more recently, The Lego Movie, with co-directors
Chris Miller and Phil Lord. “Chris and Phil were determined to sort
of make sure the audience was confused about what they were seeing. You know is it actually stop motion, or is
it CG film?” And that became a big debate. Before the movie came out, there was a lot
of conversation about whether the movie was stop motion or computer animation. "It is, I would say 99% CG animation, but
it respects the rules of stop motion animation, and is designed to emulate that style.” To understand what made that style so unique,
you have to look back at what Lego movies used to look like. Early productions for themes like Bionicle,
Star Wars, and Batman helped establish the whimsical feel of Lego movies — but the
animation didn’t fit the physics of the toy itself. “There was this tendency to sort of treat
the plastic like it was flexible rubber, which meant that the characters could flex and move
a lot more than they might be able to in real life.” That style is typical of more traditional
computer animation, like what you’d expect to see in a Pixar movie. Take a shot like this, for example. The background isn’t made of actual blocks,
plastic limbs are bending in ways they couldn’t, and the faces are a bizarre blend of skin-like
texture and Lego geometry. It doesn’t look like a scene you could make
at home with your own Legos. Compare that to scenes from The Lego Movie,
where everything — gunshots, smoke, water, fire, explosions, clouds, even mud on the camera
lens — are all made up of Lego pieces as they look in real life. “We respected the hardness of the plastic
by not necessarily bending on the elbow, which you can’t do on a real Lego minifig.” That means that any movement you see onscreen
simulates the adjustment or replacement of an individual Lego piece. A joint or facial expression will never actually
bend or stretch — it’ll either move slightly or be replaced by another piece. Early Lego movies lacked that level of discipline. They struggled because they fought back against the limitations of the medium instead of embracing them. But the creators of the Lego Movie saw things
differently. “Characters that have limitations force you
to find solutions and charming ways of doing things in different ways. I mean, look at R2-D2: he’s like, the ultimate
limited character, he’s basically a bin with wheels that makes beeping noises, and
that’s all he's got to work with. And yet he’s a really charming character and everybody loves him. Same with BB-8. And other characters. Same with the Muppets, they’re essentially sock puppets with googly eyes that you don't really have much control over. But it’s from those limitations that you actually get a lot of charm.” Every now and then, the Lego movie animators
would let some joints overextend slightly to make room for a nod or a shrug of the shoulders... But overall, sticking to the plastic rule
made for a believable movie. You can freeze frame any part of the Lego
Movie and look at a scene that you could practically make at home. “We were always trying to echo and hark
back to how a child might make a film. So we would alternate between thinking like
responsible filmmakers working on a large-budget Warner Brothers animated film, and then we
would suddenly approach a scene as if we were like a kid animating in their basement.” But the history of Lego movies actually does start
with kids animating in their basements. In 1973, two Danish cousins, aged 10 and 12,
shot a short film called Journey to the Moon on Super 8 film. They made it for their grandparents’ 50th
wedding anniversary — and it’s widely considered to be the first time anyone made
a motion picture with Lego blocks. Note that the “people” in this film are
just little cylinder blocks — this was before any version of the minifigure design came
out. Movies like this came to be known as “Brickfilms.” When fans were making these at home, they
shot them in traditional stop motion. Footage was usually shot “on twos,” which
meant that they would take 12 pictures — adjusting the characters every other frame — to make
one second of film. Shooting “on ones” meant taking 24 pictures
per second — this was usually reserved for making faster movements like running look
smoother. When the Danish cousins sent their movie to
the managing director of the Lego Group, they were rewarded with a tour of the Lego factory
and sent home with large Lego sets. But Lego hasn’t always had the most positive
reaction to homemade fan films like this one. Between 1985 and 1989, a teenage animator
named Lindsay Fleay worked on a 16-minute short called The Magic Portal. He used borrowed equipment to shoot it in
his parents’ basement. Before entering festivals and competitions,
Fleay sent the film to Lego to see if they were interested in doing something with it. At first, Lego responded with a letter of
approval. But soon, the company started expressing legal
concerns and issued a letter demanding Fleay surrender all copies of the film within seven
days. Lego ultimately backed down, but Fleay had
already missed out on most major film festivals by then. Fleay actually went on to work at Animal Logic. He left before production on Lego projects
began, but his movie had a huge influence on the world of Brickfilms. “If you look at the live action portion
of The Lego Movie, you'll see Finn, the little kid, holds up a sort of cardboard  tube and across the side is written Magic Portal." The Lego Movie, of course, was a huge technical
feat. There are 15,080,330 animated Lego pieces and 182 unique minifigures in the movie. Early mockups of buildings and vehicles were drafted on a free software called Lego Digital Designer Later on, in the animation software Maya,
each brick was given profiles for fingerprints, dents, seam lines, scratches, and dust. It’s hard to imagine what The Lego Movie
would be if it weren’t for the legacy of these early home experiments. Where most animated films use soft lighting
modeled after paintings, The Lego Movie’s lighting was harsh, replicating the actual
lamps that animators like Fleay used. Playful non-stop motion interludes — like
levitation via fishing line — were part of Journey to the Moon long before they appeared
in The Lego Movie. Even the final break from the Lego world into
the real world to meet a human creator parallels The Magic Portal really closely. Ah, my film! It’s easy to miss on-screen, but The Lego
Movie pays tribute to fan films in the background of this scene — these four clips are shorts
submitted by fans. “Look at all these things that people built!” The homage was a nod to the fans. By doing that, the movie embraced the idea
that amateur creators matter — and sometimes, the way they handle source material is far
better than the way major studios are used to doing it. If you want to try any of this at home, you
can actually use the same software that the animators of The Lego Movie used. It’s called Lego Digital Designer, it’s
totally free off the internet. When I talked to Grant Freckelton, he challenged
me to make this sort of pig-drawn carriage. I tried. I got the pigs, I got the wheels, but not
much else. It’s very, very difficult.

act like a tiny power source? Because sugar is piezoelectric. Piezoelectric materials 
turn mechanical stress, like pressure, sound waves, and other vibrations into electricity and vice versa. This odd phenomenon was first
discovered by the physicist Pierre Curie 
and his brother Jacques in 1880. They discovered that if they compressed
thin slices of certain crystals, positive and negative charges would appear
on opposite faces. This difference in charge, or voltage, meant that the compressed crystal
could drive current through a circuit, like a battery. And it worked the other way around, too. Running electricity through these crystals
made them change shape. Both of these results, turning mechanical energy into electrical, and electrical energy into mechanical, were remarkable. But the discovery went uncelebrated
for several decades. The first practical application
was in sonar instruments used to detect German submarines
during World War I. Piezoelectric quartz crystals 
in the sonar's transmitter vibrated when they were subjected
to alternating voltage. That sent ultrasound waves
through the water. Measuring how long it took these waves
to bounce back from an object revealed how far away it was. For the opposite transformation, converting mechanical energy 
to electrical, consider the lights that turn on
when you clap. Clapping your hands send sound vibrations
through the air and causes the piezo element to bend
back and forth. This creates a voltage that can drive
enough current to light up the LEDs, though it's conventional sources 
of electricity that keep them on. So what makes a material piezoelectric? The answer depends on two factors: the materials atomic structure, and how electric charge
is distributed within it. Many materials are crystalline, meaning they're made of atoms or ions arranged in an orderly 
three-dimensional pattern. That pattern has a building block
called a unit cell that repeats over and over. In most non-piezoelectric 
crystalline materials, the atoms in their unit cells
are distributed symmetrically around a central point. But some crystalline materials
don't possess a center of symmetry making them candidates 
for piezoelectricity. Let's look at quartz, a piezoelectric material 
made of silicon and oxygen. The oxygens have a slight negative charge
and silicons have a slight positive, creating a separation of charge, or a dipole along each bond. Normally, these dipoles 
cancel each other out, so there's no net separation of charge
in the unit cell. But if a quartz crystal is squeezed
along a certain direction, the atoms shift. Because of the resulting asymmetry
in charge distribution, the dipoles no longer cancel
each other out. The stretched cell ends up
with a net negative charge on one side and a net positive on the other. This charge imbalance is repeated
all the way through the material, and opposite charges collect
on opposite faces of the crystal. This results in a voltage that can
drive electricity through a circuit. Piezoelectric materials can 
have different structures. But what they all have in common is unit
cells which lack a center of symmetry. And the stronger the compression
on piezoelectric materials, the larger the voltage generated. Stretch the crystal, instead,
and the voltage will switch, making current flow the other way. More materials are piezoelectric
than you might think. DNA, bone, and silk all have this ability to turn
mechanical energy into electrical. Scientists have created a variety
of synthetic piezoelectric materials and found applications for them
in everything from medical imaging to ink jet printers. Piezoelectricity is responsible for 
the rhythmic oscillations of the quartz crystals
that keep watches running on time, the speakers of musical birthday cards, and the spark that ignites the gas 
in some barbecue grill lighters when you flick the switch. And piezoelectric devices may become
even more common since electricity is in high demand
and mechanical energy is abundant. There are already train stations
that use passengers' footsteps to power the ticket gates and displays and a dance club where piezoelectricity
helps power the lights. Could basketball players running back
and forth power the scoreboard? Or might walking down the street
charge your electronic devices? What's next for piezoelectricity?

of synthetic piezoelectric materials and found applications for them
in everything from medical imaging to ink jet printers. Piezoelectricity is responsible for 
the rhythmic oscillations of the quartz crystals
that keep watches running on time, the speakers of musical birthday cards, and the spark that ignites the gas 
in some barbecue grill lighters when you flick the switch. And piezoelectric devices may become
even more common since electricity is in high demand
and mechanical energy is abundant. There are already train stations
that use passengers' footsteps to power the ticket gates and displays and a dance club where piezoelectricity
helps power the lights. Could basketball players running back
and forth power the scoreboard? Or might walking down the street
charge your electronic devices? What's next for piezoelectricity?

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're asked
to invent something new. It could be whatever you want made from anything you choose in any shape or size. That kind of creative freedom
sounds so liberating, doesn't it? Or does it? If you're like most people,
you'd probably be paralyzed by this task. Without more guidance,
where would you even begin? As it turns out, boundless freedom
isn't always helpful. In reality, any project is restricted
by many factors, such as the cost, what materials you have at your disposal, and unbreakable laws of physics. These factors are called 
creative constraints, and they're the requirements 
and limitations we have to address 
in order to accomplish a goal. Creative constraints apply 
across professions, to architects and artists, writers, engineers, and scientists. In many fields, constraints play
a special role as drivers of discovery and invention. During the scientific process 
in particular, constraints are an essential part
of experimental design. For instance, a scientist studying
a new virus would consider, "How can I use the tools 
and techniques at hand to create an experiment that tells me
how this virus infects the body's cells? And what are the limits of my knowledge
that prevent me from understanding 
this new viral pathway?" In engineering, constraints have us
apply our scientific discoveries to invent something new and useful. Take, for example, 
the landers Viking 1 and 2, which relied on thrusters to arrive
safely on the surface of Mars. The problem? Those thrusters left foreign chemicals
on the ground, contaminating soil samples. So a new constraint was introduced. How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemicals
from Earth? The next Pathfinder mission used
an airbag system to allow the rover to bounce
and roll to a halt without burning contaminating fuel. Years later, we wanted to send
a much larger rover: Curiosity. However, it was too large 
for the airbag design, so another constraint was defined. How can we land a large rover
while still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil? In response, engineers had a wild idea. They designed a skycrane. Similar to the claw machine at toy stores, it would lower the rover 
from high above the surface. With each invention, the engineers
demonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking - that solutions must recognize
the limitations of current technology in order to advance it. Sometimes this progress is iterative, as in, "How can I make a better
parachute to land my rover?" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible 
parachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints 
guide decision-making to ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars 
problem yet to be solved. Say we want to send astronauts
who will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system
that keeps the water very clean and enables 100% recovery. Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have 
the technology for it now. But in the process of trying 
to meet these objectives, we might discover other applications
of any inventions that result. Building an innovative 
water filtration system could provide a solution for farmers
working in drought-stricken regions, or a way to clean municipal water
in polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures
in one field address the constraints of another. When scientist Alexander Fleming
mistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the discovery 
of the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the constraints
of other problems. Understanding constraints guides
scientific progress, and what's true in science
is also true in many other fields. Constraints aren't the boundaries
of creativity, but the foundation of it.

this new viral pathway?" In engineering, constraints have us
apply our scientific discoveries to invent something new and useful. Take, for example, 
the landers Viking 1 and 2, which relied on thrusters to arrive
safely on the surface of Mars. The problem? Those thrusters left foreign chemicals
on the ground, contaminating soil samples. So a new constraint was introduced. How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemicals
from Earth? The next Pathfinder mission used
an airbag system to allow the rover to bounce
and roll to a halt without burning contaminating fuel. Years later, we wanted to send
a much larger rover: Curiosity. However, it was too large 
for the airbag design, so another constraint was defined. How can we land a large rover
while still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil? In response, engineers had a wild idea. They designed a skycrane. Similar to the claw machine at toy stores, it would lower the rover 
from high above the surface. With each invention, the engineers
demonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking - that solutions must recognize
the limitations of current technology in order to advance it. Sometimes this progress is iterative, as in, "How can I make a better
parachute to land my rover?" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible 
parachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints 
guide decision-making to ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars 
problem yet to be solved. Say we want to send astronauts
who will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system
that keeps the water very clean and enables 100% recovery. Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have 
the technology for it now. But in the process of trying 
to meet these objectives, we might discover other applications
of any inventions that result. Building an innovative 
water filtration system could provide a solution for farmers
working in drought-stricken regions, or a way to clean municipal water
in polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures
in one field address the constraints of another. When scientist Alexander Fleming
mistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the discovery 
of the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the constraints
of other problems. Understanding constraints guides
scientific progress, and what's true in science
is also true in many other fields. Constraints aren't the boundaries
of creativity, but the foundation of it.

**Transcript**:
As one of the most notorious gangsters
in history, Al Capone presided over a vast
and profitable empire of organized crime. When he was finally put on trial, the most he could be convicted of
was tax evasion. The nearly $100 million a year, that's 1.4 billion in today's currency, that Capone had earned from
illegal gambling, bootlegging, brothels, and extortion, would have served as evidence
of his crimes. But the money was nowhere
to be found. Capone and his associates had hidden it
through investments in various businesses whose ultimate ownership
couldn't be proven, like cash-only laundromats. In fact, those laundromats are part of
the reason for the name of this activity, money laundering. Money laundering came 
to be the term for any process that cleans illegally obtained funds
of their dirty criminal origins, allowing them to be used within
the legal economy. But Capone wasn't the first
to launder money. In fact, this practice is about
as old as money itself. Merchants hid their riches from
tax collecters, and pirates sought to sell their bounty
without drawing attention to how they got it. With the recent arrival 
of virtual currencies, offshore banking, the darknet, and global markets, schemes have become much more complex. Although modern money laundering
methods vary greatly, most share three basic steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement is where illegally obtained
money is converted into assets that seem legitimate. That's often done by depositing funds
into a bank account registered to an anonymous corporation
or a professional middleman. This step is where criminals are often
most vulnerable to detection since they introduce massive wealth
into the financial system seemingly out of nowhere. The second step, layering, involves
using multiple transactions to further distance the funds
from their origin. This can take the form of transfers
between multiple accounts, or the purchase of tradable property, like expensive cars, artwork, and real estate. Casinos, where large sums of money
change hands every second, are also popular venues for layering. A money launderer may have their
gambling balance made available at a casino chain's locations 
in other countries, or work with employees
to rig games. The last step, integration, allows clean
money to re-enter the mainstream economy and to benefit the original criminal. They might invest it into a legal business claiming payment by producing
fake invoices, or even start a bogus charity, placing themselves 
on the board of directors with an exorbitant salary. Money laundering itself wasn't officially recognized as a federal
crime in the United States until 1986. Before that point, the government
needed to prosecute a related crime, like tax evasion. From 1986 on, they could confiscate
wealth simply by demonstrating that concealment had occurred, which had a positive effect on prosecuting
major criminal operations, like drug traffickers. However, a legal shift has raised concerns involving privacy 
and government surveillance. Today, the United Nations, national governments, and various nonprofits fight against money laundering, yet the practice continues to play
a major role in global crime. And the most high-profile instances
of money laundering have involved 
not just private individuals, but major financial institutions
and government officials. No one knows for sure the total
amount of money that's laundered on a yearly basis, but some organizations estimate it to be
in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

and profitable empire of organized crime. When he was finally put on trial, the most he could be convicted of
was tax evasion. The nearly $100 million a year, that's 1.4 billion in today's currency, that Capone had earned from
illegal gambling, bootlegging, brothels, and extortion, would have served as evidence
of his crimes. But the money was nowhere
to be found. Capone and his associates had hidden it
through investments in various businesses whose ultimate ownership
couldn't be proven, like cash-only laundromats. In fact, those laundromats are part of
the reason for the name of this activity, money laundering. Money laundering came 
to be the term for any process that cleans illegally obtained funds
of their dirty criminal origins, allowing them to be used within
the legal economy. But Capone wasn't the first
to launder money. In fact, this practice is about
as old as money itself. Merchants hid their riches from
tax collecters, and pirates sought to sell their bounty
without drawing attention to how they got it. With the recent arrival 
of virtual currencies, offshore banking, the darknet, and global markets, schemes have become much more complex. Although modern money laundering
methods vary greatly, most share three basic steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement is where illegally obtained
money is converted into assets that seem legitimate. That's often done by depositing funds
into a bank account registered to an anonymous corporation
or a professional middleman. This step is where criminals are often
most vulnerable to detection since they introduce massive wealth
into the financial system seemingly out of nowhere. The second step, layering, involves
using multiple transactions to further distance the funds
from their origin. This can take the form of transfers
between multiple accounts, or the purchase of tradable property, like expensive cars, artwork, and real estate. Casinos, where large sums of money
change hands every second, are also popular venues for layering. A money launderer may have their
gambling balance made available at a casino chain's locations 
in other countries, or work with employees
to rig games. The last step, integration, allows clean
money to re-enter the mainstream economy and to benefit the original criminal. They might invest it into a legal business claiming payment by producing
fake invoices, or even start a bogus charity, placing themselves 
on the board of directors with an exorbitant salary. Money laundering itself wasn't officially recognized as a federal
crime in the United States until 1986. Before that point, the government
needed to prosecute a related crime, like tax evasion. From 1986 on, they could confiscate
wealth simply by demonstrating that concealment had occurred, which had a positive effect on prosecuting
major criminal operations, like drug traffickers. However, a legal shift has raised concerns involving privacy 
and government surveillance. Today, the United Nations, national governments, and various nonprofits fight against money laundering, yet the practice continues to play
a major role in global crime. And the most high-profile instances
of money laundering have involved 
not just private individuals, but major financial institutions
and government officials. No one knows for sure the total
amount of money that's laundered on a yearly basis, but some organizations estimate it to be
in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

**Transcript**:
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie 
discovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products
and jewelry. It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful
effects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Unfortunately, radium isn't the only
pigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly. That lamentable distinction includes
a trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves
and the things we make: white, green, and orange. Our story begins with white. As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make
the brilliant white pigment we know today. The problem? In humans, lead is directly absorbed
into the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal
functions of calcium, causing damages ranging 
from learning disabilities to high blood pressure. Yet the practice 
of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures. Lead white was the only practical choice
for white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century. To make their paint, artists would grind
a block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles. The pigment's liberal use resulted
in what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning. Artists who worked with lead complained
of palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. But lead white's density, opacity,
and warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,
and later, the Impressionists. Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely
used until it was banned in the 1970s. As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects 
pale in comparison to another, 
more wide-spread pigment, green. Two synthetic greens called 
Scheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century. They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens
made from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices
for paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing. These green pigments were made from
a compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic. In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells 
communicate and function. And high levels of arsenic have been
directly linked to cancer and heart disease. As a result, 18th century fabric
factory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses 
reportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin. Bed bugs were rumored not to live
in green rooms, and it's even been speculated that
Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green 
wallpapered bedroom. The intense toxicity of these green
stayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published
in 1822. And a century later, it was repurposed
as an insecticide. Synthetic green was probably the most
dangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's
property of radioactivity. Another color did, though - orange. Before World War II, it was common
for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes. The compound produced brilliant
reds and oranges, which were appealing attributes,
if not for the radiation they emitted. Of course, radiation was something
we were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks,
which we discovered much later. During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium
for use in bomb development. However, the atomic energy commission
relaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics
and glass factory floors. Orange dishes made during 
the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities
on their surfaces to this day. Most notably, vintage fiestaware
reads positive for radioactivity. And while the levels are low enough that
they don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food
off of them. Though we still occasionally run 
into issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us
prune hazardous colors out of our lives.

**Transcript**:
In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie 
discovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products
and jewelry. It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful
effects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Unfortunately, radium isn't the only
pigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly. That lamentable distinction includes
a trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves
and the things we make: white, green, and orange. Our story begins with white. As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make
the brilliant white pigment we know today. The problem? In humans, lead is directly absorbed
into the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal
functions of calcium, causing damages ranging 
from learning disabilities to high blood pressure. Yet the practice 
of using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures. Lead white was the only practical choice
for white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century. To make their paint, artists would grind
a block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles. The pigment's liberal use resulted
in what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning. Artists who worked with lead complained
of palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. But lead white's density, opacity,
and warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,
and later, the Impressionists. Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely
used until it was banned in the 1970s. As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects 
pale in comparison to another, 
more wide-spread pigment, green. Two synthetic greens called 
Scheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century. They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens
made from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices
for paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing. These green pigments were made from
a compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic. In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells 
communicate and function. And high levels of arsenic have been
directly linked to cancer and heart disease. As a result, 18th century fabric
factory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses 
reportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin. Bed bugs were rumored not to live
in green rooms, and it's even been speculated that
Napoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green 
wallpapered bedroom. The intense toxicity of these green
stayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published
in 1822. And a century later, it was repurposed
as an insecticide. Synthetic green was probably the most
dangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's
property of radioactivity. Another color did, though - orange. Before World War II, it was common
for manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes. The compound produced brilliant
reds and oranges, which were appealing attributes,
if not for the radiation they emitted. Of course, radiation was something
we were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks,
which we discovered much later. During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium
for use in bomb development. However, the atomic energy commission
relaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics
and glass factory floors. Orange dishes made during 
the next decade may still have some hazardous qualities
on their surfaces to this day. Most notably, vintage fiestaware
reads positive for radioactivity. And while the levels are low enough that
they don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food
off of them. Though we still occasionally run 
into issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us
prune hazardous colors out of our lives.

**Transcript**:
During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor 
of agriculture, highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea
was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built
the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown 
around the world today, yet it was originally consumed
very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste
out of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations
to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures
in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art
you might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century 
during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first
tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed
their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation 
of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century 
during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor 
shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes
to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a
virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three 
essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power
and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest
around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe
in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,
a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with
the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the
midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew,
interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times
the price of coffee and the plant was still 
only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, 
the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea
back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid
for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea 
for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem
within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official 
ordered his men to destroy massive 
British shipments of opium as a statement against 
Britain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War
between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down 
the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded
the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing
for over a century. The British East India company also
wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned 
botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China 
in a covert operation. He disguised himself 
and took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees 
and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, 
the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth
as an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed
beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways
of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 21, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 8
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
During a long day spent roaming the forest
in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong
accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor 
of agriculture, highlights tea's importance 
to ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea
was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built
the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown 
around the world today, yet it was originally consumed
very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable
or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food
to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination
of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste
out of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations
to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage 
called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct
Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures
in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art
you might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century 
during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first
tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed
their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation 
of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century 
during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor 
shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes
to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a
virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three 
essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power
and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest
around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe
in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,
a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with
the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the
midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew,
interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times
the price of coffee and the plant was still 
only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, 
the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition
between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea
back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid
for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea 
for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem
within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official 
ordered his men to destroy massive 
British shipments of opium as a statement against 
Britain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War
between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down 
the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded
the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing
for over a century. The British East India company also
wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned 
botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China 
in a covert operation. He disguised himself 
and took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees 
and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, 
the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth
as an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed
beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways
of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It starts with a cough, or a wheeze. Soon, your chest feels tight. Your breathing speeds up
and gets shallower, making you feel short of breath. These are common symptoms
of an asthma attack. Around the world, more than 300 million
people suffer from asthma, and around 250,000 people 
die from it each year. But why do people get asthma
and how can this disease be deadly? Asthma affects the respiratory system, particularly the smaller airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. These airways have an inner lining
called the mucosa that's surrounded 
by a layer of smooth muscle. In people with asthma, the airways
are chronically inflamed, which can make them hyper-responsive
to certain triggers. Some of the many asthma triggers
include tobacco smoke, pollen, dust, fragrances, exercise, cold weather, stress, and even the common cold. When people with asthma are exposed
to these triggers, an asthma attack, or exacerbation,
can occur. But how exactly do such everyday factors
lead to an asthma attack? If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger, the smooth rings of muscle that circle
the small airways in their lungs contract and become narrow. Simultaneously, the trigger
worsens inflammation, causing the mucosal lining
to become more swollen and secrete more mucus. Under normal conditions, the body uses this mucus to trap
and clear particles, like pollen or dust, but during an asthma attack, it blocks the narrowed airways,
making it even harder to breathe. These effects lead 
to this symptoms of asthma. Smooth muscle constriction results
in the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation
can cause coughing. And the wheezing noise? That happens because 
as the airways constrict, air whistles as it passes through
the narrowed space. These symptoms may make a person
feel like they're running out of air. Yet counterintuitively, 
during an asthma attack, the inflammation can make it harder
to exhale than inhale. Over time, this leads to an excess
of air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. The trapping of air inside the lungs
forces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen
delivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated 
severe asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from
lack of oxygen. So how do we prevent these uncomfortable
and potentially fatal attacks in people who have asthma? One way is to reduce the presence
of triggers. Unfortunately, the world 
is an unpredictable place and exposure to triggers can't
always be controlled. This is where inhalers, the primary
treatment for asthma, come in. These medications help asthmatics both
control and prevent their asthma symptoms. Inhalers transport medication along
the affected airways using a liquid mist or fine powder
to treat the problem at its source. They come in two forms. There are reliever medications, which treat symptoms immediately
and contain beta-agonists. Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces, allowing the airways to widen so more air
can travel into and out of the lungs. The other form of inhalers serve
as preventive medications, which treat asthma symptoms
over the long term, and contain corticosteroids. Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity
and inflammation, so asthma can be kept under control. They're also crucial in preventing
long-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways. Inhalers are known to be very effective, and have helped many people
live better lives. Although we've come a long way
in improving how we treat and diagnose asthma, we still don't know its exact causes. We currently believe that a combination
of genetic and environmental factors play a role, potentially acting during early childhood. Recent research has even linked
poverty to asthma incidents. This may be due to reasons ranging from exposure to additional pollutants
and environmental irritants to difficulties in obtaining medical care
or treatment. As our understanding of asthma improves, we can continue to find better ways to
keep people's airways happy and healthy.

lead to an asthma attack? If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger, the smooth rings of muscle that circle
the small airways in their lungs contract and become narrow. Simultaneously, the trigger
worsens inflammation, causing the mucosal lining
to become more swollen and secrete more mucus. Under normal conditions, the body uses this mucus to trap
and clear particles, like pollen or dust, but during an asthma attack, it blocks the narrowed airways,
making it even harder to breathe. These effects lead 
to this symptoms of asthma. Smooth muscle constriction results
in the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation
can cause coughing. And the wheezing noise? That happens because 
as the airways constrict, air whistles as it passes through
the narrowed space. These symptoms may make a person
feel like they're running out of air. Yet counterintuitively, 
during an asthma attack, the inflammation can make it harder
to exhale than inhale. Over time, this leads to an excess
of air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. The trapping of air inside the lungs
forces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen
delivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated 
severe asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from
lack of oxygen. So how do we prevent these uncomfortable
and potentially fatal attacks in people who have asthma? One way is to reduce the presence
of triggers. Unfortunately, the world 
is an unpredictable place and exposure to triggers can't
always be controlled. This is where inhalers, the primary
treatment for asthma, come in. These medications help asthmatics both
control and prevent their asthma symptoms. Inhalers transport medication along
the affected airways using a liquid mist or fine powder
to treat the problem at its source. They come in two forms. There are reliever medications, which treat symptoms immediately
and contain beta-agonists. Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces, allowing the airways to widen so more air
can travel into and out of the lungs. The other form of inhalers serve
as preventive medications, which treat asthma symptoms
over the long term, and contain corticosteroids. Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity
and inflammation, so asthma can be kept under control. They're also crucial in preventing
long-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways. Inhalers are known to be very effective, and have helped many people
live better lives. Although we've come a long way
in improving how we treat and diagnose asthma, we still don't know its exact causes. We currently believe that a combination
of genetic and environmental factors play a role, potentially acting during early childhood. Recent research has even linked
poverty to asthma incidents. This may be due to reasons ranging from exposure to additional pollutants
and environmental irritants to difficulties in obtaining medical care
or treatment. As our understanding of asthma improves, we can continue to find better ways to
keep people's airways happy and healthy.

It starts with a cough, or a wheeze. Soon, your chest feels tight. Your breathing speeds up
and gets shallower, making you feel short of breath. These are common symptoms
of an asthma attack. Around the world, more than 300 million
people suffer from asthma, and around 250,000 people 
die from it each year. But why do people get asthma
and how can this disease be deadly? Asthma affects the respiratory system, particularly the smaller airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. These airways have an inner lining
called the mucosa that's surrounded 
by a layer of smooth muscle. In people with asthma, the airways
are chronically inflamed, which can make them hyper-responsive
to certain triggers. Some of the many asthma triggers
include tobacco smoke, pollen, dust, fragrances, exercise, cold weather, stress, and even the common cold. When people with asthma are exposed

can occur. But how exactly do such everyday factors

**Transcript**:
On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again. They did this by creating 
for the first time a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global
electricity market, nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades. What happened to the great promise
of this technology? It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast. To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times 
its natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high, containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air, spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products
in these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds 
of thousands of years. The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans
or the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature. This mix must be isolated from
the environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security. How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential. But their successors have learned
humbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.

neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily
and stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction
is a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands 
on the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted
from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low
and the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago
used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down 
neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium
and raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use
purified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still
a little too fast. To compensate 
and keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times 
its natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by
passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 
from heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued
to highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction
in a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing
must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction 
of the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the
kinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor
as heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive
an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical 
not only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded
type of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe
carrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly
and melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape 
into the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building
is the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure
is too high, containment fails and the gasses
escape into the air, spreading as far 
and wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products
in these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds 
of thousands of years. The greatest challenge 
for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans
or the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering
once the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater
storage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water 
that cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium
that failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material
not found in nature. This mix must be isolated from
the environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage
in tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about
their long-term security. How can a nation that has existed
for only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium
through its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants
sit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an
even greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste
to make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only
a safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years
of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap 
the tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source
with incredible potential. But their successors have learned
humbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian
industrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for
complex, expensive, and risky engineering.

**Transcript**:
On a December afternoon in Chicago
during the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus
at the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy
over and over again. They did this by creating 
for the first time a chain reaction inside a new
engineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great
amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian
source of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough
electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household
for nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global
electricity market, nuclear power has declined from
an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further
in the coming decades. What happened to the great promise
of this technology? It turns out nuclear power 
faces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie 
a series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission
of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting
in many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed
with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total
of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140
lacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less
tightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits
the U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements
called fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass
transforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy
powers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second 
larger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons
strike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even
larger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed
using control rods made of elements that capture excess 
neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily

**Transcript**:
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.

**Transcript**:
In 1796, Thomas Jefferson received
a box of bones he couldn't identify. A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones 
suggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown
species of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out 
for this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't
come from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared
around 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across
North, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures
like mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,
were cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,
weighed about a ton, and that was small 
compared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,
as much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests
and savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,
and prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados
today if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow
the avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees
far and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions
of years, but around 10,000 years ago,
they started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's
other giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths
could have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,
maybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time
most of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive
and migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left
living in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way
to avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food
and use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary
for survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have
is tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet
with higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,
rely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies
for coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from
their food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach
that takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,
or even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle
is to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,
by not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,
resting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once
a week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes
to cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means
that sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less
muscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy 
to keep themselves warm because their body temperature
can fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,
but more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations 
minimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest 
metabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths
to thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves
a great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little
extra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make 
them any less remarkable.
