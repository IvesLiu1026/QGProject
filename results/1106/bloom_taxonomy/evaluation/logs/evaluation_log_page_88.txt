**Transcript**:
The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail. They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail. And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom. So what causes phantom limb sensations? The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains. And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map. But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful. To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain. Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space. Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord and up to the brain. Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself, most of it remains 
behind after an amputation. But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway. At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure. Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify. Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain. There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them. The entire body is mapped in this cortex. Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas. The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part. For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists. The brain also increases 
cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger. This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain. The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there, because they still 
have representation in the brain. Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it. But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own. Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time. A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb. The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror. This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it. Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike. Prosthetics can also 
create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove 
their prosthetics at night. And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize
prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively. There are still many questions 
about phantom limbs. We don’t know why some amputees
escape the pain typically associated 
with these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all. And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people 
who experience them. A deeper understanding 
of these apparitions will give us insight into the work
our brains do every day to build the world as we perceive it. They’re an important reminder that the realities we experience are,
in fact, subjective.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match.

Question 4 discusses the representation of body parts in the somatosensory cortex and how it relates to the number of nerve endings. Although it doesn't directly ask about how the brain receives sensory input from the limbs, it does touch on the neural pathways involved in processing sensory information.

A more suitable match would be a question that explicitly asks about the neural pathways or mechanisms by which the brain receives sensory input from the limbs. However, given the available options, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 9 has some similarities in intent and content.

However, the correct answer is actually Question 6, because it is the only question that also has an option stating that the answer is not yet known or is innate, similar to the ground truth MCQ. But the actual most similar generated MCQ is not present, so I will choose the closest one.

But if I had to choose the closest generated MCQ based on the intent of not knowing something about phantom limbs, I would choose Question 9's intent and content but with the options of Question 6.

Since I have to choose one of the generated MCQs, I will choose Question 6.

Answer: 6

**Transcript**:
The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail. They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail. And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom. So what causes phantom limb sensations? The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains. And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map. But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful. To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain. Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space. Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord and up to the brain. Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself, most of it remains 
behind after an amputation. But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway. At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure. Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify. Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain. There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them. The entire body is mapped in this cortex. Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas. The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part. For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists. The brain also increases 
cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger. This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain. The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there, because they still 
have representation in the brain. Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it. But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own. Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time. A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb. The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror. This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it. Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike. Prosthetics can also 
create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove 
their prosthetics at night. And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize
prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively. There are still many questions 
about phantom limbs. We don’t know why some amputees
escape the pain typically associated 
with these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all. And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people 
who experience them. A deeper understanding 
of these apparitions will give us insight into the work
our brains do every day to build the world as we perceive it. They’re an important reminder that the realities we experience are,
in fact, subjective.

**Transcript**:
A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse, rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover. To get some time alone together, the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks that involve feigning madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night 
to sing outside her house. This becomes so tiresome 
that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the window 
for him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides 
to try farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk 
is waiting with a red-hot poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters. Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English, which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today. It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact 
with European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English alphabet 
is still familiar today, with the inclusion 
of a few archaic symbols, such as yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales 
first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral. Eager and nosy
for some personal details, the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition: whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner. If not for their pilgrimage, many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact. This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a professional class of merchants 
and intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of his life 
as a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout Italy and France,
as well as his native England. This may have influenced
the panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales,
no level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses the quirks 
of the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The varied dialects, genres, 
and literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the different ways Medieval audiences 
entertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale 
of courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and slapstick. This variation 
includes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation. While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader
is free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 3: What is the plot device used by the host of the Tabard Inn to encourage the characters to share their stories? Options: A. A competition to see who can tell the longest tale, B. A competition to see who can tell the most humorous tale, C. A competition where the best tale will be rewarded with dinner, D. A request for each character to share their life story Correct Option: C

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that directly addresses why the characters are together.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the reason the characters are together. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the context and the information provided in the transcript, I would say that the closest match is:

None of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible generated MCQ that could match the ground truth MCQ:

Possible Generated MCQ: Question: Why are the characters in "The Canterbury Tales" together? Options: A. A funeral, B. A battle, C. A pilgrimage, D. A banquet Correct Option: C

Since this question is not available among the generated MCQs, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of context:

Question 2: What is the setting where the characters in "The Canterbury Tales" first meet? Options: A. A local market, B. The Tabard Inn in Southwark, C. A royal court, D. A church Correct Option: B

This question is related to the context of the characters meeting, but it does not directly address why they are together.

However, I must note that there is a better option that can be considered a match:

Question 7 and Question 4 provide context that can be used to infer why the characters are together (the pilgrimage and the feudal system that separates the characters' social classes), but they do not directly address the question.

Considering the options and the context, I would say that the closest match among the provided generated MCQs is:

Question 7 or Question 4 (indirectly), but since I need to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will choose:

 Question 4 (even though it's an indirect match).

**Transcript**:
A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse, rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover. To get some time alone together, the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks that involve feigning madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night 
to sing outside her house. This becomes so tiresome 
that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the window 
for him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides 
to try farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk 
is waiting with a red-hot poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters. Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English, which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today. It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact 
with European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English alphabet 
is still familiar today, with the inclusion 
of a few archaic symbols, such as yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales 
first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral. Eager and nosy
for some personal details, the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition: whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner. If not for their pilgrimage, many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact. This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a professional class of merchants 
and intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of his life 
as a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout Italy and France,
as well as his native England. This may have influenced
the panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales,
no level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses the quirks 
of the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The varied dialects, genres, 
and literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the different ways Medieval audiences 
entertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale 
of courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and slapstick. This variation 
includes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation. While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader
is free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you.

**Transcript**:
When trains began to shuttle people 
across the coutryside, many insisted 
they would never replace horses. Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts 
insisted they wouldn’t catch on. Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves. Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before. The other half described those features 
in their present selves, and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change each participant reported or predicted. For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change 
came up short compared to the changes 
their older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected 
to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer 
had the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still 
have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds 
had lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole, they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us. One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician 
ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved
in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, 
there’s no real way to predict what our preferences 
will be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans. So the end of history illusion 
applies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? Could we be assuming that how things 
are now is how they will continue to be? If so, fortunately,
there are countless records to remind us that the world does change,
sometimes for the better. Our own historical moment 
isn’t the end of history, and that can be just as much a source
of comfort as a cause for concern.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible reason for this mismatch. The ground truth MCQ asks about the publication year of the research paper, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, focus on the concepts and ideas discussed in the transcript, rather than specific details like publication years.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is tangentially related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, which mentions the research paper and its title, "The End of History Illusion." However, this question does not ask about the publication year, so it is not a direct match.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the generated MCQs as a match for the ground truth MCQ. A new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the publication year of the research paper would be needed to match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible reason for this mismatch. The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of participants involved in the research, which is a specific detail mentioned in the transcript. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, focus on more general concepts and findings from the research.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9, which mentions the relationship between age and personal change, and the fact that the researchers recruited participants across different age groups. However, this question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ. Alternatively, you can provide more context or clarify what you would like me to do next.

That being said, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, despite the fact that it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ:

Index: None (or 9, if you'd like a rough approximation)

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
When trains began to shuttle people 
across the coutryside, many insisted 
they would never replace horses. Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts 
insisted they wouldn’t catch on. Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves. Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before. The other half described those features 
in their present selves, and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change each participant reported or predicted. For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change 
came up short compared to the changes 
their older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected 
to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer 
had the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still 
have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds 
had lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole, they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us. One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician 
ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved
in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, 
there’s no real way to predict what our preferences 
will be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans. So the end of history illusion 
applies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? Could we be assuming that how things 
are now is how they will continue to be? If so, fortunately,
there are countless records to remind us that the world does change,
sometimes for the better. Our own historical moment 
isn’t the end of history, and that can be just as much a source
of comfort as a cause for concern.

**Transcript**:
A high forehead topped 
by disheveled black hair, a sickly pallor, and a look of deep intelligence 
and deeper exhaustion in his dark, sunken eyes. Edgar Allan Poe’s image 
is not just instantly recognizable – it’s perfectly suited to his reputation. From the prisoner strapped 
under a descending pendulum blade, to a raven who refuses 
to leave the narrator’s chamber, Poe’s macabre and innovative stories 
of gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature. But just what is it that makes
Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors? After all, horror was a popular
genre of the period, with many practitioners. Yet Poe stood out thanks to his
careful attention to form and style. As a literary critic, he identified two cardinal rules 
for the short story form: it must be short enough 
to read in one sitting, and every word 
must contribute to its purpose. By mastering these rules, Poe commands the reader’s attention and rewards them with an intense 
and singular experience – what Poe called the unity of effect. Though often frightening,
this effect goes far beyond fear. Poe’s stories use violence and horror
to explore the paradoxes and mysteries of love, grief, and guilt, while resisting simple interpretations 
or clear moral messages. And while they often hint 
at supernatural elements, the true darkness they explore
is the human mind and its propensity for self-destruction. In “The Tell-Tale Heart,”
a ghastly murder is juxtaposed with the killer’s 
tender empathy towards the victim – a connection that soon 
returns to haunt him. The title character of "Ligeia"
returns from the dead through the corpse 
of her husband’s second wife – or at least the opium-addicted 
narrator thinks she does. And when the protagonist 
of “William Wilson” violently confronts a man 
he believes has been following him, he might just be staring 
at his own image in a mirror. Through his pioneering use 
of unreliable narrators, Poe turns readers into active participants who must decide when a storyteller
might be misinterpreting or even lying about the events 
they’re relating. Although he’s best known 
for his short horror stories, Poe was actually one of the most versatile and experimental writers 
of the nineteenth century. He invented the detective story 
as we know it, with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” followed by “The Mystery of Marie Roget” and “The Purloined Letter.” All three feature 
the original armchair detective, C. Auguste Dupin, who uses his genius and unusual powers 
of observation and deduction to solve crimes that baffle the police. Poe also wrote satires of social 
and literary trends, and hoaxes that in some cases 
anticipated science fiction. Those included an account of 
a balloon voyage to the moon, and a report of a dying patient 
put into a hypnotic trance so he could speak from the other side. Poe even wrote an adventure novel 
about a voyage to the South Pole and a treatise on astrophysics, all while he worked as an editor, producing hundreds of pages 
of book reviews and literary theory. An appreciation of Poe’s career 
wouldn’t be complete without his poetry: haunting and hypnotic. His best-known poems are songs of grief, 
or in his words, “mournful and never-ending remembrance.” “The Raven,” in which the speaker 
projects his grief onto a bird who merely repeats a single sound, made Poe famous. But despite his literary success, Poe lived in poverty 
throughout his career, and his personal life was often 
as dark as his writing. He was haunted by the loss of his mother 
and his wife, who both died of tuberculosis 
at the age of 24. Poe struggled with alcoholism and frequently antagonized 
other popular writers. Much of his fame came from posthumous –
and very loose – adaptations of his work. And yet, if he could’ve known 
how much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generations
of readers and writers alike, perhaps it may have brought 
a smile to that famously brooding visage.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a literary genre in which Poe did not publish, while Question 8 asks about the title of Poe's adventure novel. However, Question 8 implies that Poe did publish in the adventure novel genre, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's intent.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about a genre in which Poe did not publish, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 8, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
A high forehead topped 
by disheveled black hair, a sickly pallor, and a look of deep intelligence 
and deeper exhaustion in his dark, sunken eyes. Edgar Allan Poe’s image 
is not just instantly recognizable – it’s perfectly suited to his reputation. From the prisoner strapped 
under a descending pendulum blade, to a raven who refuses 
to leave the narrator’s chamber, Poe’s macabre and innovative stories 
of gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature. But just what is it that makes
Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors? After all, horror was a popular
genre of the period, with many practitioners. Yet Poe stood out thanks to his
careful attention to form and style. As a literary critic, he identified two cardinal rules 
for the short story form: it must be short enough 
to read in one sitting, and every word 
must contribute to its purpose. By mastering these rules, Poe commands the reader’s attention and rewards them with an intense 
and singular experience – what Poe called the unity of effect. Though often frightening,
this effect goes far beyond fear. Poe’s stories use violence and horror
to explore the paradoxes and mysteries of love, grief, and guilt, while resisting simple interpretations 
or clear moral messages. And while they often hint 
at supernatural elements, the true darkness they explore
is the human mind and its propensity for self-destruction. In “The Tell-Tale Heart,”
a ghastly murder is juxtaposed with the killer’s 
tender empathy towards the victim – a connection that soon 
returns to haunt him. The title character of "Ligeia"
returns from the dead through the corpse 
of her husband’s second wife – or at least the opium-addicted 
narrator thinks she does. And when the protagonist 
of “William Wilson” violently confronts a man 
he believes has been following him, he might just be staring 
at his own image in a mirror. Through his pioneering use 
of unreliable narrators, Poe turns readers into active participants who must decide when a storyteller
might be misinterpreting or even lying about the events 
they’re relating. Although he’s best known 
for his short horror stories, Poe was actually one of the most versatile and experimental writers 
of the nineteenth century. He invented the detective story 
as we know it, with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” followed by “The Mystery of Marie Roget” and “The Purloined Letter.” All three feature 
the original armchair detective, C. Auguste Dupin, who uses his genius and unusual powers 
of observation and deduction to solve crimes that baffle the police. Poe also wrote satires of social 
and literary trends, and hoaxes that in some cases 
anticipated science fiction. Those included an account of 
a balloon voyage to the moon, and a report of a dying patient 
put into a hypnotic trance so he could speak from the other side. Poe even wrote an adventure novel 
about a voyage to the South Pole and a treatise on astrophysics, all while he worked as an editor, producing hundreds of pages 
of book reviews and literary theory. An appreciation of Poe’s career 
wouldn’t be complete without his poetry: haunting and hypnotic. His best-known poems are songs of grief, 
or in his words, “mournful and never-ending remembrance.” “The Raven,” in which the speaker 
projects his grief onto a bird who merely repeats a single sound, made Poe famous. But despite his literary success, Poe lived in poverty 
throughout his career, and his personal life was often 
as dark as his writing. He was haunted by the loss of his mother 
and his wife, who both died of tuberculosis 
at the age of 24. Poe struggled with alcoholism and frequently antagonized 
other popular writers. Much of his fame came from posthumous –
and very loose – adaptations of his work. And yet, if he could’ve known 
how much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generations
of readers and writers alike, perhaps it may have brought 
a smile to that famously brooding visage.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What was the cause of death of both Edgar Allan Poe's mother and wife? Options: A. Tuberculosis, B. Cancer, C. Heart disease, D. Stroke Correct Option: A.

However, the ground truth MCQ asks about the age at which Poe's mother and wife died, not the cause of death. Among the generated MCQs, none directly matches the ground truth MCQ. But if we consider the intent and content related to Poe's mother and wife, Question 6 is the closest match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say 6, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the age at which Poe's mother and wife died, which is not present among the provided options.

**Transcript**:
Human beings are everywhere. With settlements on every continent, we can be found in the most isolated 
corners of Earth’s jungles, oceans, and tundras. Our impact is so profound,
most scientists believe humanity has left a permanent mark 
on Earth’s geological record. So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared? With no one maintaining them, some
of our creations backfire immediately. Hours after we disappear,
oil refineries malfunction, producing month-long blazes at
plants like the ones in western India, the southern United States, and South Korea. In underground rail systems 
like those in London, Moscow, and New York City, hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,
flooding the tunnels in just three days. By the end of the first week,
most emergency generators have shut down, and once the fires have gone out, the earth goes dark 
for the first time in centuries. After the first catastrophic month,
changes come more gradually. Within 20 years, sidewalks have been 
torn apart by weeds and tree roots. Around this time, flooded tunnels erode 
the streets above into urban rivers. In temperate climates, the cycle of seasons freezes 
and thaws these waterways, cracking pavement 
and concrete foundations. Leaking pipes cause the same reaction 
in concrete buildings, and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers 
buckle and tumble down. In cities built in river deltas 
like Houston, these buildings 
eventually wash away completely - filling nearby tributaries 
with crushed concrete. Rural and suburban areas 
decay more slowly, but in largely unsurprising ways. Leaks, mold, bug 
and rodent infestations - all the usual enemies of the homeowner- now go uncontested. Within 75 years, most houses' 
supporting beams have rotted and sagged, and the resulting collapsed heap 
is now home to local rodents and lizards. But in this post-human world, 
“local” has a new meaning. Our cities are full of imported plants, which now run wild across 
their adopted homes. Water hyacinth coat the waterways 
of Shanghai in a thick green carpet. Poisonous giant hogweeds overgrow
the banks of London’s Thames River. Chinese Ailanthus trees burst
through New York City streets. And as sunken skyscrapers add
crumbled concrete to the new forest floor, the soil acidity plummets, potentially allowing 
new plant life to thrive. This post-human biodiversity 
extends into the animal kingdom, as well. Animals follow the unchecked 
spread of native and non-native plants, venturing into new habitats 
with the help of our leftover bridges. In general, our infrastructure 
saves some animals and dooms others. Cockroaches continue to thrive 
in their native tropical habitats, but without our heating systems, their urban cousins likely freeze
and die out in just two winters. And most domesticated animals 
are unable to survive without us – save for a handful of resourceful pigs, 
dogs, and feral housecats. Conversely, the reduced light pollution 
saves over a billion birds each year whose migrations were disrupted 
by blinking communication tower lights and high-tension wires. And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one
of their favorite manmade nurseries – rubber tires, which last 
for almost a thousand years. As fauna and flora flourish, Earth’s climate slowly recovers 
from millennia of human impact. Within 35,000 years, the plant cycle removes
the last traces of lead left by the Industrial Revolution 
from Earth’s soil, and it may take 
up to 65,000 years beyond that for CO2 to return pre-human levels. But even after several million years,
humanity’s legacy lives on. Carved in unyielding granite, America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years. The chemical composition 
of our bronze sculptures keeps them recognizable 
for over 10 million. And buried deep underground, the remnants of cities 
built on floodplains have been preserved in time 
as a kind of technofossil. Eventually, these traces, too, 
will be wiped from the planet’s surface. Humanity hasn’t always been here, 
and we won’t be here forever. But by investigating the world without us, perhaps we can learn more 
about the world we live in now.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 2 is about the time it takes for the plant cycle to remove lead from the soil, it's not a direct match.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the time it takes for a specific infrastructure or object to decay or collapse. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the time it takes for suburban homes to collapse.

But if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question intent and content, I would say that Question 7 is the closest. It talks about the decay of urban and rural areas, which is related to the collapse of suburban homes.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 7

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the time it takes for suburban homes to collapse.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What would be the likely outcome for domesticated animals if humans were to suddenly disappear?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about which animal thrives after humans leave the earth, while Question 4 asks about the outcome for domesticated animals. However, among the options for Question 4, it is mentioned that "Most would be unable to survive without humans, except for a few resourceful species." This implies that some animals, like the ones mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (dogs, pigs, and feral housecats), would thrive or survive.

However, an even more similar question can be found:

**Question 9: How would the reduced light pollution affect bird migrations in a post-human world? Options: A. It would disrupt their migrations further., B. It would have no significant impact on their migrations., C. It would save over a billion birds each year., D. It would cause them to migrate to different locations.**

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Human beings are everywhere. With settlements on every continent, we can be found in the most isolated 
corners of Earth’s jungles, oceans, and tundras. Our impact is so profound,
most scientists believe humanity has left a permanent mark 
on Earth’s geological record. So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared? With no one maintaining them, some
of our creations backfire immediately. Hours after we disappear,
oil refineries malfunction, producing month-long blazes at
plants like the ones in western India, the southern United States, and South Korea. In underground rail systems 
like those in London, Moscow, and New York City, hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,
flooding the tunnels in just three days. By the end of the first week,
most emergency generators have shut down, and once the fires have gone out, the earth goes dark 
for the first time in centuries. After the first catastrophic month,
changes come more gradually. Within 20 years, sidewalks have been 
torn apart by weeds and tree roots. Around this time, flooded tunnels erode 
the streets above into urban rivers. In temperate climates, the cycle of seasons freezes 
and thaws these waterways, cracking pavement 
and concrete foundations. Leaking pipes cause the same reaction 
in concrete buildings, and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers 
buckle and tumble down. In cities built in river deltas 
like Houston, these buildings 
eventually wash away completely - filling nearby tributaries 
with crushed concrete. Rural and suburban areas 
decay more slowly, but in largely unsurprising ways. Leaks, mold, bug 
and rodent infestations - all the usual enemies of the homeowner- now go uncontested. Within 75 years, most houses' 
supporting beams have rotted and sagged, and the resulting collapsed heap 
is now home to local rodents and lizards. But in this post-human world, 
“local” has a new meaning. Our cities are full of imported plants, which now run wild across 
their adopted homes. Water hyacinth coat the waterways 
of Shanghai in a thick green carpet. Poisonous giant hogweeds overgrow
the banks of London’s Thames River. Chinese Ailanthus trees burst
through New York City streets. And as sunken skyscrapers add
crumbled concrete to the new forest floor, the soil acidity plummets, potentially allowing 
new plant life to thrive. This post-human biodiversity 
extends into the animal kingdom, as well. Animals follow the unchecked 
spread of native and non-native plants, venturing into new habitats 
with the help of our leftover bridges. In general, our infrastructure 
saves some animals and dooms others. Cockroaches continue to thrive 
in their native tropical habitats, but without our heating systems, their urban cousins likely freeze
and die out in just two winters. And most domesticated animals 
are unable to survive without us – save for a handful of resourceful pigs, 
dogs, and feral housecats. Conversely, the reduced light pollution 
saves over a billion birds each year whose migrations were disrupted 
by blinking communication tower lights and high-tension wires. And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one
of their favorite manmade nurseries – rubber tires, which last 
for almost a thousand years. As fauna and flora flourish, Earth’s climate slowly recovers 
from millennia of human impact. Within 35,000 years, the plant cycle removes
the last traces of lead left by the Industrial Revolution 
from Earth’s soil, and it may take 
up to 65,000 years beyond that for CO2 to return pre-human levels. But even after several million years,
humanity’s legacy lives on. Carved in unyielding granite, America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years. The chemical composition 
of our bronze sculptures keeps them recognizable 
for over 10 million. And buried deep underground, the remnants of cities 
built on floodplains have been preserved in time 
as a kind of technofossil. Eventually, these traces, too, 
will be wiped from the planet’s surface. Humanity hasn’t always been here, 
and we won’t be here forever. But by investigating the world without us, perhaps we can learn more 
about the world we live in now.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Compare and contrast the effects of human disappearance on urban and rural areas. How would they differ, and why?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match is not available among the provided generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest.

A better match would be a question that asks about the specific events that occur within the first month of human disappearance, with options that include the events mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose one from the provided options, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

**7**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more suitable question would be needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can try to create a new question that would be a better match:

**New Question:** What would NOT happen within the first month of human disappearance?
**Options:** A. Oil refinery fires, B. Flooded subway tunnels, C. Emergency generators shutting down, D. Streets eroding into rivers.

This new question is a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: Compare and contrast the effects of human disappearance on urban and rural areas. How would they differ, and why?**

However, this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the side effects of decaying cities.

A closer match can be found by re-evaluating the generated MCQs. Among the options, **Question 3** is somewhat related, but it's more focused on designing a new city to minimize damage.

Upon re-examination, I found that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would suggest **Question 7**, as it discusses the decay of urban areas, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that specifically addresses the side effects of decaying cities, matching the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

Given the available options, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

**7**

Please note that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically address the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Cigarettes aren’t good for us. That’s hardly news--we’ve known 
about the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens 
as their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically 
when we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, 
a black, resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, 
and eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages 
nerve-endings in the nose, causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases 
the likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases
like bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is 
to keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide 
crosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported
around the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant 
called nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine 
and other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations 
which make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals 
from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction 
of blood vessels and damage their delicate 
endothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet stickiness, increasing the likelihood 
that clots will form and trigger heart attacks and strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes 
can trigger dangerous mutations in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic 
and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability 
to fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three 
cancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer. Smoking can cause cancer 
in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder 
for women to get pregnant. And in men,
it can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside with almost immediate 
and long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after 
a smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure
begin to return to normal. After 12 hours, 
carbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s 
oxygen-carrying capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as
blood pressure and heart rates normalize. After two days, the nerve endings responsible 
for smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier 
after about one month, with less coughing 
and shortness of breath. The delicate hair-like cilia 
in the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are restored after 9 months, 
improving resistance to infection. By the one-year anniversary of quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half
as blood vessel function improves. Five years in, the chance of a clot forming
dramatically declines, and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce. After ten years, the chances 
of developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50%, probably because the body’s ability 
to repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen years in, the likelihood 
of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same 
as that of a non-smoker. There’s no point pretending 
this is all easy to achieve. Quitting can lead to anxiety 
and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately, 
such effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier,
thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin patches, lozenges, and sprays may help wean smokers off cigarettes. They work by stimulating 
nicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms, without the addition 
of other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarette-free. That’s good news, since quitting puts you and your body 
on the path back to health.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Cigarettes aren’t good for us. That’s hardly news--we’ve known 
about the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens 
as their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically 
when we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, 
a black, resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, 
and eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages 
nerve-endings in the nose, causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases 
the likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases
like bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is 
to keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide 
crosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported
around the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant 
called nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine 
and other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations 
which make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals 
from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction 
of blood vessels and damage their delicate 
endothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet stickiness, increasing the likelihood 
that clots will form and trigger heart attacks and strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes 
can trigger dangerous mutations in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic 
and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability 
to fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three 
cancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer. Smoking can cause cancer 
in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder 
for women to get pregnant. And in men,
it can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside with almost immediate 
and long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after 
a smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure
begin to return to normal. After 12 hours, 
carbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s 
oxygen-carrying capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as
blood pressure and heart rates normalize. After two days, the nerve endings responsible 
for smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier 
after about one month, with less coughing 
and shortness of breath. The delicate hair-like cilia 
in the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are restored after 9 months, 
improving resistance to infection. By the one-year anniversary of quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half
as blood vessel function improves. Five years in, the chance of a clot forming
dramatically declines, and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce. After ten years, the chances 
of developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50%, probably because the body’s ability 
to repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen years in, the likelihood 
of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same 
as that of a non-smoker. There’s no point pretending 
this is all easy to achieve. Quitting can lead to anxiety 
and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately, 
such effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier,
thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin patches, lozenges, and sprays may help wean smokers off cigarettes. They work by stimulating 
nicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms, without the addition 
of other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarette-free. That’s good news, since quitting puts you and your body 
on the path back to health.

**Transcript**:
In the year 1066, 7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed 
in warships across the English Channel. Their target: England, 
home to more than a million people. Theirs was a short voyage
with massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans
were setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate
throughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave 
their mark so far and wide? Our story begins 
over 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle 
on the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus 
across northern Europe. The French locals called 
these invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles, 
the king of the Franks, negotiated peace with 
the Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land 
along France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable
to their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting 
from Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit 
of their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights 
were looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement 
was their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of 
the new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army 
near the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in 
the 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold 
in the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains 
with a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname 
"William the Conqueror" through a massive survey
known as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population
and ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language 
of the new royal court, while commoners continued 
to speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged 
to give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords 
and peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded 
into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Meanwhile, independent groups 
of Norman knights traveled to the Mediterranean, inspired by tales of pilgrims 
returning from Jerusalem. There, they threw themselves 
into a tangled mass of conflicts among the established powers 
all over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded 
heavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became 
standard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central 
to the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established
Christian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm 
and Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them
to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of
multicultural tolerance in a world torn apart 
by religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars 
served in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors 
and architects. Arabic remained an official language along
with Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge 
was compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate 
available for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo
combined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with
exquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful,
why aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of
their success: not just ruling the societies 
they conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually 
disappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and
cathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape to wherever 
the English language is spoken, the Norman legacy lives on.

near the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in 
the 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold 
in the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains 
with a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname 
"William the Conqueror" through a massive survey
known as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population
and ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language 
of the new royal court, while commoners continued 
to speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged 
to give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords 
and peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded 
into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Meanwhile, independent groups 
of Norman knights traveled to the Mediterranean, inspired by tales of pilgrims 
returning from Jerusalem. There, they threw themselves 
into a tangled mass of conflicts among the established powers 
all over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded 
heavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became 
standard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central 
to the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established
Christian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm 
and Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them
to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of
multicultural tolerance in a world torn apart 
by religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars 
served in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors 
and architects. Arabic remained an official language along
with Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge 
was compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate 
available for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo
combined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with
exquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful,
why aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of
their success: not just ruling the societies 
they conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually 
disappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and
cathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape to wherever 
the English language is spoken, the Norman legacy lives on.

However, this question does not directly ask for the year of the Norman invasion of England. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks for the year of the invasion.

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly ask for the year of the Norman invasion of England. But if I had to choose one based on the closest relation to the event described in the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

Question 1: Who granted the Viking leader Rollo a stretch of land along France's northern coast in 911? Options: A. Charles, the king of England, B. Charles, the king of the Franks, C. William, the Duke of Normandy, D. Harold Godwinson

This question is not a direct match, but it does provide a date (911) that is mentioned in the transcript as a significant event in the history of the Normans. However, it does not match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no direct match, but the closest related question is:

Index: 3 (with the caveat that it does not directly ask for the year of the invasion)

A more suitable approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly asks for the year of the Norman invasion of England, such as:

**Transcript**:
In the year 1066, 7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed 
in warships across the English Channel. Their target: England, 
home to more than a million people. Theirs was a short voyage
with massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans
were setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate
throughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave 
their mark so far and wide? Our story begins 
over 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle 
on the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus 
across northern Europe. The French locals called 
these invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles, 
the king of the Franks, negotiated peace with 
the Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land 
along France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable
to their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting 
from Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit 
of their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights 
were looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement 
was their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of 
the new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army 
near the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in

**Transcript**:
Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, 
who’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking 
at someone who’s not married? Take a moment to think about it. Most people answer that there’s 
not enough information to tell. And most people are wrong. Linda must be either married 
or not married—there are no other options. So in either scenario, someone married 
is looking at someone who’s not married. When presented with the explanation, 
most people change their minds and accept the correct answer, despite being very confident 
in their first responses. Now let’s look at another case. A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan 
and Jason Reifler examined American attitudes regarding 
the justifications for the Iraq War. Researchers presented participants 
with a news article that showed no weapons 
of mass destruction had been found. Yet many participants not only continued 
to believe that WMDs had been found, but they even became more convinced 
of their original views. So why do arguments change people’s minds 
in some cases and backfire in others? Arguments are more convincing when they 
rest on a good knowledge of the audience, taking into account 
what the audience believes, who they trust, and what they value. Mathematical and logical arguments 
like the dinner party brainteaser work because even when people 
reach different conclusions, they’re starting from 
the same set of shared beliefs. In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician 
named Kurt Gödel presented a proof that a logically complete
system of mathematics was impossible. Despite upending decades of
work by brilliant mathematicians like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert, the proof was accepted because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on. Of course, many disagreements involve 
different beliefs that can’t simply be reconciled
through logic. When these beliefs involve 
outside information, the issue often comes down to
what sources and authorities people trust. One study asked people to estimate 
several statistics related to the scope of climate change. Participants were asked questions, such as “how many of the years 
between 1995 and 2006 were one of the hottest 12 years 
since 1850?” After providing their answers, they were presented with data from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in this case showing that the answer 
was 11 of the 12 years. Being provided with these reliable 
statistics from a trusted official source made people more likely to accept 
the reality that the earth is warming. Finally, for disagreements that 
can’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making a convincing argument may depend on engaging 
the audience’s values. For example, researchers have conducted 
a number of studies where they’ve asked people 
of different political backgrounds to rank their values. Liberals in these studies, 
on average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is treated 
in the same way—above loyalty. In later studies, researchers attempted 
to convince liberals to support military spending with 
a variety of arguments. Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty— such as that the military 
unifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus. The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best way to find out
is simply to talk to them. In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments
and rebuttals. These can help you make your own 
arguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes, you may even end up 
being the one changing your mind.

to convince liberals to support military spending with 
a variety of arguments. Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty— such as that the military 
unifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus. The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best way to find out
is simply to talk to them. In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments
and rebuttals. These can help you make your own 
arguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes, you may even end up 
being the one changing your mind.

**Transcript**:
Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, 
who’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking 
at someone who’s not married? Take a moment to think about it. Most people answer that there’s 
not enough information to tell. And most people are wrong. Linda must be either married 
or not married—there are no other options. So in either scenario, someone married 
is looking at someone who’s not married. When presented with the explanation, 
most people change their minds and accept the correct answer, despite being very confident 
in their first responses. Now let’s look at another case. A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan 
and Jason Reifler examined American attitudes regarding 
the justifications for the Iraq War. Researchers presented participants 
with a news article that showed no weapons 
of mass destruction had been found. Yet many participants not only continued 
to believe that WMDs had been found, but they even became more convinced 
of their original views. So why do arguments change people’s minds 
in some cases and backfire in others? Arguments are more convincing when they 
rest on a good knowledge of the audience, taking into account 
what the audience believes, who they trust, and what they value. Mathematical and logical arguments 
like the dinner party brainteaser work because even when people 
reach different conclusions, they’re starting from 
the same set of shared beliefs. In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician 
named Kurt Gödel presented a proof that a logically complete
system of mathematics was impossible. Despite upending decades of
work by brilliant mathematicians like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert, the proof was accepted because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on. Of course, many disagreements involve 
different beliefs that can’t simply be reconciled
through logic. When these beliefs involve 
outside information, the issue often comes down to
what sources and authorities people trust. One study asked people to estimate 
several statistics related to the scope of climate change. Participants were asked questions, such as “how many of the years 
between 1995 and 2006 were one of the hottest 12 years 
since 1850?” After providing their answers, they were presented with data from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in this case showing that the answer 
was 11 of the 12 years. Being provided with these reliable 
statistics from a trusted official source made people more likely to accept 
the reality that the earth is warming. Finally, for disagreements that 
can’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making a convincing argument may depend on engaging 
the audience’s values. For example, researchers have conducted 
a number of studies where they’ve asked people 
of different political backgrounds to rank their values. Liberals in these studies, 
on average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is treated 
in the same way—above loyalty. In later studies, researchers attempted 
to convince liberals to support military spending with 
a variety of arguments. Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty— such as that the military 
unifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus. The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best way to find out

**Transcript**:
It’s another sweltering morning 
in Memphis, Egypt. As the sunlight brightens the Nile, 
Peseshet checks her supplies. Honey, garlic, cumin, acacia leaves, cedar oil. She’s well stocked with the essentials 
she needs to treat her patients. Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor. In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored 
at the Per Ankh, the House of Life. Now, she teaches her own students there. Before teaching, 
Peseshet has a patient to see. One of the workers at the temple 
construction site has injured his arm. When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, 
with multiple bone fragments. Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury. Her next stop is the House of Life. On her way, a woman intercepts 
Peseshet in the street. The woman’s son 
has been stung by a scorpion. Peseshet has seen many similar stings 
and knows exactly what to do. She must say an incantation 
to cast the poison out. She begins to recite the spell, invoking Serqet, patron of physicians 
and goddess of venomous creatures. Peseshet recites the spell 
as if she is Serqet. This commanding approach 
has the greatest chance at success. After she utters the last line, she tries to cut the poison out 
with a knife for good measure. Peseshet packs up to leave,
but the woman has another question. She wants to find out if she is pregnant. Peseshet explains 
her fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer. Then, urinate on the seeds every day. If the plants grow, she’s pregnant. A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl. Peseshet also recommends a prayer
to Hathor, goddess of fertility. When Peseshet finally arrives 
at the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi. She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks
priests are very full of themselves. She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role 
as neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman 
of the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus. Inside, the House of Life is bustling 
as usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students. Papyri containing all kinds of records, 
not just medical information, are stored here. Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard 
at work copying documents as part of his training 
to become a scribe. He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study 
because Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, 
and impossible for girls, to pursue this education. Peseshet oversees all the female 
swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis. The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors 
won’t answer to a woman. Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy. She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits. Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her 
at the door and begs to be examined. The woman has a huge, 
sore lump under her arm. Peseshet probes the growth 
and finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit. She has read about ailments 
like this, but never seen one. For this tumor there is no treatment, 
medicine or spell. All the texts give the same advice: 
do nothing. After delivering the bad news, 
Peseshet goes outside. She lingers on the steps
of the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk. In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients 
she can’t help, like the woman with the tumor. They linger with her,
but Peseshet has no time to dwell. In a few short weeks, the Nile’s annual flooding will begin, bringing life to the soil for 
the next year’s harvest and a whole new crop of patients.

her fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer. Then, urinate on the seeds every day. If the plants grow, she’s pregnant. A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl. Peseshet also recommends a prayer
to Hathor, goddess of fertility. When Peseshet finally arrives 
at the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi. She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks
priests are very full of themselves. She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role 
as neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman 
of the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus. Inside, the House of Life is bustling 
as usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students. Papyri containing all kinds of records, 
not just medical information, are stored here. Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard 
at work copying documents as part of his training 
to become a scribe. He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study 
because Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, 
and impossible for girls, to pursue this education. Peseshet oversees all the female 
swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis. The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors 
won’t answer to a woman. Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy. She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits. Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her 
at the door and begs to be examined. The woman has a huge, 
sore lump under her arm. Peseshet probes the growth 
and finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit. She has read about ailments 
like this, but never seen one. For this tumor there is no treatment, 
medicine or spell. All the texts give the same advice: 
do nothing. After delivering the bad news, 
Peseshet goes outside. She lingers on the steps
of the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk. In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients 
she can’t help, like the woman with the tumor. They linger with her,
but Peseshet has no time to dwell. In a few short weeks, the Nile’s annual flooding will begin, bringing life to the soil for 
the next year’s harvest and a whole new crop of patients.

**Transcript**:
It’s another sweltering morning 
in Memphis, Egypt. As the sunlight brightens the Nile, 
Peseshet checks her supplies. Honey, garlic, cumin, acacia leaves, cedar oil. She’s well stocked with the essentials 
she needs to treat her patients. Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor. In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored 
at the Per Ankh, the House of Life. Now, she teaches her own students there. Before teaching, 
Peseshet has a patient to see. One of the workers at the temple 
construction site has injured his arm. When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, 
with multiple bone fragments. Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury. Her next stop is the House of Life. On her way, a woman intercepts 
Peseshet in the street. The woman’s son 
has been stung by a scorpion. Peseshet has seen many similar stings 
and knows exactly what to do. She must say an incantation 
to cast the poison out. She begins to recite the spell, invoking Serqet, patron of physicians 
and goddess of venomous creatures. Peseshet recites the spell 
as if she is Serqet. This commanding approach 
has the greatest chance at success. After she utters the last line, she tries to cut the poison out 
with a knife for good measure. Peseshet packs up to leave,
but the woman has another question. She wants to find out if she is pregnant. Peseshet explains

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 6: What was the name of the institution where medical papyri were stored, and where Peseshet taught her students?**

Although this question does not directly ask for Peseshet's location of residence, one of the options provided in the ground truth MCQ (Memphis) is closely related to the setting of Question 6 (the Per Ankh, or House of Life, in Memphis). However, a more accurate match would be a question asking directly about Peseshet's residence.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Peseshet's residence, the closest match would be a question that mentions a location related to Peseshet. Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most relevant.

However, if I had to choose a question with the understanding that none of them are a perfect match, I would choose Question 6, but with the understanding that the correct answer should be an institution located in the correct answer (Memphis) of the ground truth MCQ.

But since it is not a direct match and for clarity and following the instructions to the letter, I will provide the following response:

There is no direct match to the ground truth MCQ in the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Imagine trying to use words 
to describe every scene in a film, every note in your favorite song, or every street in your town. Now imagine trying to do it using 
only the numbers 1 and 0. Every time you use the Internet
to watch a movie, listen to music, or check directions, that’s exactly what your device is doing, using the language of binary code. Computers use binary because 
it's a reliable way of storing data. For example, a computer's main
memory is made of transistors that switch between either high 
or low voltage levels, such as 5 volts and 0 volts. Voltages sometimes oscillate,
but since there are only two options, a value of 1 volt 
would still be read as "low." That reading is done by 
the computer’s processor, which uses the transistors’ states 
to control other computer devices according to software instructions. The genius of this system 
is that a given binary sequence doesn't have a pre-determined meaning 
on its own. Instead, each type of data
is encoded in binary according to a separate 
set of rules. Let’s take numbers. In normal decimal notation,  each digit is multiplied by 10 raised 
to the value of its position, starting from zero on the right. So 84 in decimal form is 4x10⁰ + 8x10¹. Binary number notation works similarly, but with each position 
based on 2 raised to some power. So 84 would be written as follows: Meanwhile, letters are interpreted 
based on standard rules like UTF-8, which assigns each character to a specific
group of 8-digit binary strings. In this case, 01010100 corresponds 
to the letter T. So, how can you know whether 
a given instance of this sequence is supposed to mean T or 84? Well, you can’t from seeing 
the string alone – just as you can’t tell what the sound
"da" means from hearing it in isolation. You need context to tell whether you're
hearing Russian, Spanish, or English. And you need similar context to tell whether you’re looking 
at binary numbers or binary text. Binary code is also used for 
far more complex types of data. Each frame of this video, for instance, is made of hundreds 
of thousands of pixels. In color images, every pixel is represented 
by three binary sequences that correspond to the primary colors. Each sequence encodes a number that determines
the intensity of that particular color. Then, a video driver program transmits 
this information to the millions of liquid crystals 
in your screen to make all the different hues 
you see now. The sound in this video 
is also stored in binary, with the help of a technique 
called pulse code modulation. Continuous sound waves are digitized by taking "snapshots" of their 
amplitudes every few milliseconds. These are recorded as numbers 
in the form of binary strings, with as many as 44,000
for every second of sound. When they’re read by 
your computer’s audio software, the numbers determine how quickly 
the coils in your speakers should vibrate to create sounds of different frequencies. All of this requires billions 
and billions of bits. But that amount can be reduced 
through clever compression formats. For example, if a picture has 30 adjacent 
pixels of green space, they can be recorded as "30 green" instead
of coding each pixel separately - a process known as run-length encoding. These compressed formats are themselves 
written in binary code. So is binary the end-all-be-all 
of computing? Not necessarily. There’s been research 
into ternary computers, with circuits in three possible states, and even quantum computers, whose circuits can be
in multiple states simultaneously. But so far, none of these has provided as much physical stability 
for data storage and transmission. So for now, everything you see, hear, and read through your screen comes to you as the result 
of a simple "true" or "false" choice, made billions of times over.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of different "quantities" that can be expressed with a binary sequence of 8 bits. The correct answer is 256, equivalent to 2^8.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match, but it asks about the representation of the number 84 in decimal notation, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that Question 5 mentions the UTF-8 standard, which assigns each character to a specific group of 8-digit binary strings. This is related to the concept of binary sequences and their representation.

But the closest match is not Question 4 or Question 5. Instead, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but only because it mentions binary code, which is the topic of the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, the question intent and content are quite different.

If I really had to choose one, I would say:

Index: 4 (although it's not a direct match)

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically addresses the topic of binary sequences and their representation should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

to control other computer devices according to software instructions. The genius of this system 
is that a given binary sequence doesn't have a pre-determined meaning 
on its own. Instead, each type of data
is encoded in binary according to a separate 
set of rules. Let’s take numbers. In normal decimal notation,  each digit is multiplied by 10 raised 
to the value of its position, starting from zero on the right. So 84 in decimal form is 4x10⁰ + 8x10¹. Binary number notation works similarly, but with each position 
based on 2 raised to some power. So 84 would be written as follows: Meanwhile, letters are interpreted 
based on standard rules like UTF-8, which assigns each character to a specific
group of 8-digit binary strings. In this case, 01010100 corresponds 
to the letter T. So, how can you know whether 
a given instance of this sequence is supposed to mean T or 84? Well, you can’t from seeing 
the string alone – just as you can’t tell what the sound
"da" means from hearing it in isolation. You need context to tell whether you're
hearing Russian, Spanish, or English. And you need similar context to tell whether you’re looking 
at binary numbers or binary text. Binary code is also used for 
far more complex types of data. Each frame of this video, for instance, is made of hundreds 
of thousands of pixels. In color images, every pixel is represented 
by three binary sequences that correspond to the primary colors. Each sequence encodes a number that determines
the intensity of that particular color. Then, a video driver program transmits 
this information to the millions of liquid crystals 
in your screen to make all the different hues 
you see now. The sound in this video 
is also stored in binary, with the help of a technique 
called pulse code modulation. Continuous sound waves are digitized by taking "snapshots" of their 
amplitudes every few milliseconds. These are recorded as numbers 
in the form of binary strings, with as many as 44,000
for every second of sound. When they’re read by 
your computer’s audio software, the numbers determine how quickly 
the coils in your speakers should vibrate to create sounds of different frequencies. All of this requires billions 
and billions of bits. But that amount can be reduced 
through clever compression formats. For example, if a picture has 30 adjacent 
pixels of green space, they can be recorded as "30 green" instead
of coding each pixel separately - a process known as run-length encoding. These compressed formats are themselves 
written in binary code. So is binary the end-all-be-all 
of computing? Not necessarily. There’s been research 
into ternary computers, with circuits in three possible states, and even quantum computers, whose circuits can be
in multiple states simultaneously. But so far, none of these has provided as much physical stability 
for data storage and transmission. So for now, everything you see, hear, and read through your screen comes to you as the result 
of a simple "true" or "false" choice, made billions of times over.

**Transcript**:
Imagine trying to use words 
to describe every scene in a film, every note in your favorite song, or every street in your town. Now imagine trying to do it using 
only the numbers 1 and 0. Every time you use the Internet
to watch a movie, listen to music, or check directions, that’s exactly what your device is doing, using the language of binary code. Computers use binary because 
it's a reliable way of storing data. For example, a computer's main
memory is made of transistors that switch between either high 
or low voltage levels, such as 5 volts and 0 volts. Voltages sometimes oscillate,
but since there are only two options, a value of 1 volt 
would still be read as "low." That reading is done by 
the computer’s processor, which uses the transistors’ states

The ground truth MCQ asks about the frequency of an audio recording, while Question 8 asks about the purpose of pulse code modulation in relation to sound waves. Although not identical, both questions relate to the concept of sound waves and audio recordings.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the frequency of an audio recording. If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 8, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How can one compress a picture encoded in binary into a smaller file without loss of information?
Options: A. Half of the information stored in binary is not actually needed to store it, so it can simply be suppressed, B. We can store more data in smaller devices because of the recent advances in technology that follow Moore's law, C. When you compress a picture, you are actually creating a shortcut to some region of the main memory; since the shortcut takes less memory than the file, we have the impression it is compressed, D. Pictures usually have pixels that are very similar to their surrounding pixels; instead of storing every single one of them, the compressor software can store only the first one, as well as the number of times it must be repeated

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

This question is about run-length encoding, which is a method of compressing images by recording adjacent pixels of the same color as a single unit, rather than individually. This matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about compressing a picture encoded in binary into a smaller file without loss of information.

The correct option in Question 9, "To record adjacent pixels of the same color as a single unit," is similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ, "Pictures usually have pixels that are very similar to their surrounding pixels; instead of storing every single one of them, the compressor software can store only the first one, as well as the number of times it must be repeated." Both options describe the principle of run-length encoding.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 9.

**Transcript**:
The coldest materials in the world 
aren’t in Antarctica. They’re not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier. They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions
of a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder 
than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder 
than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder
than outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a
window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build 
incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in 
the farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such 
extreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down 
moving particles. When we’re talking about temperature,
what we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly,
we perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more
slowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object 
or gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment, 
like a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot
object is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm
to create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam 
heats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall 
moving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device 
called a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field 
draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed 
at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb
a photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from
the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams, 
in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling 
in all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly, 
as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it 
described as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down 
to just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists 
who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997
for the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been 
improved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want 
to cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make
very good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive 
to fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find 
underground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make 
highly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used 
in global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold 
enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity 
makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves 
in future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly 
tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out 
at normal temperatures, when atoms speed around 
at hundreds of meters per second. Laser cooling can slow atoms to just 
a few centimeters per second— enough for the motion caused by
atomic quantum effects to become obvious. Ultracold atoms have already 
allowed scientists to study phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, in which atoms are cooled almost 
to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter. So as researchers continue in their quest 
to understand the laws of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe, they’ll do so with the help 
of the very coldest atoms in it.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the comparison of the temperature of cold atoms to outer space. While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 1 mentions the coldest materials in the world, and the transcript provides information about the temperature comparison.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of temperature comparison, I would suggest Question 2, which mentions the method used to create extremely low temperatures in physics labs. This question is related to the concept of temperature and how it is achieved, but it does not directly compare the temperature of cold atoms to outer space.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

Index: 2

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the question asked in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The coldest materials in the world 
aren’t in Antarctica. They’re not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier. They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions
of a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder 
than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder 
than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder
than outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a
window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build 
incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in 
the farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such 
extreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down 
moving particles. When we’re talking about temperature,
what we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly,
we perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more
slowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object 
or gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment, 
like a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot
object is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm
to create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam 
heats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall 
moving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device 
called a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field 
draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed 
at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb
a photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from
the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams, 
in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling 
in all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly, 
as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it 
described as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down 
to just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists 
who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997
for the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been 
improved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want 
to cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make
very good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive 
to fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find 
underground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make 
highly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used 
in global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold 
enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity 
makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves 
in future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly 
tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out 
at normal temperatures, when atoms speed around 
at hundreds of meters per second. Laser cooling can slow atoms to just 
a few centimeters per second— enough for the motion caused by
atomic quantum effects to become obvious. Ultracold atoms have already 
allowed scientists to study phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, in which atoms are cooled almost 
to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter. So as researchers continue in their quest 
to understand the laws of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe, they’ll do so with the help 
of the very coldest atoms in it.

Imagine being strapped into a big chunk
of metal raised over a hundred twenty meters into the sky and then dropped
whizzing over hills and even looping upside down. When you put it that way roller coasters can seem a little
terrifying but they're also exhilarating and involve some really interesting
physics make all those speedy gut dropping thrills work. Most roller
coasters start off with something called a lift hill, which mechanically lifts you to
the top of the first and tallest hill. But other roller coasters start a little
more suddenly. They're rapidly propelled forward thanks the hydraulics - the branch
of physics that deals with fluids and how different mechanical forces affect
them. Hydraulic launch systems work by using a cable that's attached to two
important pieces: a catch-car which connects to the bottom of
the roller coaster train and a giant winch which is basically a huge spool
that winds the cable when it's turned by some motor. So, to launch the train this
cable pulls it down the tracks like reeling in a fish really fast. After a
few seconds the Catch-car releases the train so it can zoom up the big hill. It's
kind of a complex mechanism but we'll go over the basics. The hydraulic fluid and some
nitrogen gas are separated by a piston inside this chamber called the hydraulic
accumulator. And the key to these launch systems is the fact that liquids, like
hydraulic fluid, are incompressible. So the hydraulic fluid is pumped into the
accumulator and compresses the nitrogen gas so there's more gas molecules
bouncing around in a smaller space, which increases the pressure. Nitrogen gas is
cheap, easy to get, and won't react dangerously to heat and high pressure.
Basically no huge explosions. And once the pressure is high enough, a valve is
opened and the hydraulic fluid rushes out to power a bunch of motors, which
turn the winch, which pulls the cable and accelerates the train. Just like that,
within a couple seconds you're speeding along at hundreds of kilometers per hour.
So now that the ride started you've made it to the top of the first hill and you
start to head over the other side you might feel something weird. Like besides
the adrenaline or other chemicals that give you that exciting rush. There's that
sinking feeling in your stomach and you might feel weightless. That's because
you're in freefall - meaning that gravity is the only force acting on your body.
Normally throughout the day you're able to feel your weight because something
like the ground or a chair is pushing back on your body from your feet to your
bones and organs. But when you're in freefall you're not being supported by
anything, so there isn't a force pushing upward on you. You're just accelerating toward
the earth at 9.8 meters per second squared like any other falling object.
Now all good or slightly terrifying things have to come to an end so the
roller coaster train needs to stop somehow. Traditionally roller coasters
use breaks that coming contact with a speeding train like
something that skids along the bottom or clamps that close round metal fins on
the cars. These breaks rely on friction which causes the kinetic energy, the
energy of motion, to be converted into heat energy and stops the train. And
these brakes work but they get worn out from all this contact. But there are some
breaks that don't involve friction. They work by moving a conductor like the
metal pins sticking out from the train through a magnetic field. A magnetic
field can be produced by electric currents, like the currents running
through a wire or the microscopic currents formed by electrons moving
within atoms, which is kinda helped permanent magnets work. So on the tracks
of some roller coasters there are rows of permanent magnets that create a
magnetic field. And when the metal fins pass through the magnetic field it
induces a ring-like current called an eddy current. This has to do with Lenz's
law which essentially tells us that conductors like these metal fins don't
like change. So when the fins enter a magnetic field that wasn't there before,
they'll create a current that makes its own magnetic field that opposes this
change. The train will slow down because the kinetic energy of the moving train
is dissipated as heat by the eddy currents flowing through the metal. And
eventually the train comes to a stop all without friction. So whether you love 'em
or hate 'em, hopefully knowing some of the physics behind roller coasters can
make you appreciate them a little more. Thank you for watching this episode of

**Transcript**:
The 40 or so muscles in the human face 
can be activated in different combinations to create thousands of expressions. But do these expressions look the same and communicate the same
meaning around the world, regardless of culture? Is one person’s smile another’s grimace? Charles Darwin theorized that emotional 
expression was a common human feature. But he was in the minority. Until the mid-20th century, many researchers believed 
that the specific ways we show emotion were learned behaviors 
that varied across cultures. Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins 
was one of the few to insist otherwise. Tomkins claimed that certain affects— emotional states and their associated 
facial expressions— were universal. In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman 
set about testing this theory by examining hundreds 
of hours of film footage of remote tribes isolated 
from the modern world. Ekman found the native peoples’ 
expressions to be not only familiar, but occurring in precisely 
the situations he would expect. Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who
had no prior exposure to Western culture. They were able to correctly match photos
of different facial expressions with stories designed 
to trigger particular feelings. Over the next few decades, further research has
corroborated Darwin’s idea that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal. The degrees of expression appropriate 
to a given situation can, however, vary greatly across cultures. For instance, researchers 
have studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that 
if expressions are universal, they would be displayed 
in the same way as sighted people. In one study, both blind 
and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion
when winning or losing their matches. Further evidence can be found 
in our evolutionary relatives. Comparisons of facial expression
between humans and non-human mammals have found similarities in the structure 
and movement of facial muscles. Chimpanzee laughter 
looks different from ours, but uses some of the same 
muscle movements. Back in the 60s, Ekman identified 
six core expressions. Anger is accompanied by lowered
eyebrows drawn together, tense and narrowed eyes, and tight lips; disgust, by the lips pulled up
and the nose crinkling. In fear, the upper white of the eyes 
are revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows 
and relaxed lips. Sadness is indicated by the inner corners 
of the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards, drooping eyes, and a downturned mouth. And of course there’s happiness: lips drawn up and back, and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes. More recently, researchers 
have proposed additional entries such as contempt, shame, and disapproval, but opinions vary 
on how distinct boundaries between these categories can be drawn. So if Ekman and other researchers 
are correct, what makes certain expressions universal? And why are they expressed 
in these particular ways? Scientists have a lot of theories rooted 
in our evolutionary history. One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival. Fear and surprise could signal 
to others an immediate danger. Studies of humans and some other primates have found that we pay more attention 
to faces that signal threats over neutral faces, particularly when we’re already 
on high alert. Expressions also could 
help improve group fitness by communicating our internal states 
to those around us. Sadness, for example, signals to the group
that something’s wrong. There’s some evidence that expressions might be even more directly linked 
to our physiology. The fear expression, for instance, could directly improve survival 
in potentially dangerous situations by letting our eyes absorb more light and our lungs take in more air,

**Transcript**:
The 40 or so muscles in the human face 
can be activated in different combinations to create thousands of expressions. But do these expressions look the same and communicate the same
meaning around the world, regardless of culture? Is one person’s smile another’s grimace? Charles Darwin theorized that emotional 
expression was a common human feature. But he was in the minority. Until the mid-20th century, many researchers believed 
that the specific ways we show emotion were learned behaviors 
that varied across cultures. Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins 
was one of the few to insist otherwise. Tomkins claimed that certain affects— emotional states and their associated 
facial expressions— were universal. In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman 
set about testing this theory by examining hundreds 
of hours of film footage of remote tribes isolated 
from the modern world. Ekman found the native peoples’ 
expressions to be not only familiar, but occurring in precisely 
the situations he would expect. Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who
had no prior exposure to Western culture. They were able to correctly match photos
of different facial expressions with stories designed 
to trigger particular feelings. Over the next few decades, further research has
corroborated Darwin’s idea that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal. The degrees of expression appropriate 
to a given situation can, however, vary greatly across cultures. For instance, researchers 
have studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that 
if expressions are universal, they would be displayed 
in the same way as sighted people. In one study, both blind 
and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion
when winning or losing their matches. Further evidence can be found 
in our evolutionary relatives. Comparisons of facial expression
between humans and non-human mammals have found similarities in the structure 
and movement of facial muscles. Chimpanzee laughter 
looks different from ours, but uses some of the same 
muscle movements. Back in the 60s, Ekman identified 
six core expressions. Anger is accompanied by lowered
eyebrows drawn together, tense and narrowed eyes, and tight lips; disgust, by the lips pulled up
and the nose crinkling. In fear, the upper white of the eyes 
are revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows 
and relaxed lips. Sadness is indicated by the inner corners 
of the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards, drooping eyes, and a downturned mouth. And of course there’s happiness: lips drawn up and back, and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes. More recently, researchers 
have proposed additional entries such as contempt, shame, and disapproval, but opinions vary 
on how distinct boundaries between these categories can be drawn. So if Ekman and other researchers 
are correct, what makes certain expressions universal? And why are they expressed 
in these particular ways? Scientists have a lot of theories rooted 
in our evolutionary history. One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival. Fear and surprise could signal 
to others an immediate danger. Studies of humans and some other primates have found that we pay more attention 
to faces that signal threats over neutral faces, particularly when we’re already

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. Question 4 asks about the six core expressions that are universal across cultures, while the ground truth MCQ asks which of the options is not one of the universal expressions of emotion. 

However, if we look at the options provided in Question 4, we can see that they are all related to the universal expressions of emotion, and the correct answer (B) lists the six core expressions identified by Paul Ekman, which does not include "Trust" (the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ).

**Transcript**:
Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything 
from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies 
on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body 
for menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around 
the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male 
and female hormones. In fact, men and women 
have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role 
in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals 
in the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones 
have unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function 
of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most 
common hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas 
secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much 
thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep 
our bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of intent and topic.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of main hormone-producing glands in the body. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 does mention a specific gland (thyroid) that produces hormones.

However, a closer match in terms of intent and topic would be Question 8, which asks about the role of receptors in the endocrine system, but mentions that receptors recognize and bind to specific hormones produced by glands.

But if I had to choose one that is closest in terms of topic, I would say Question 2 is not the closest match, but rather, no direct match exists.

Upon re-reading the passage, I noticed that it does mention "there are several hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body." 

A possible match could be a question that asks about the components or the overall function of the endocrine system. In this case, the closest match would be Question 1, which asks about the primary function of the endocrine system.

However, keep in mind that this is a very loose match, as the question and options do not directly align with the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that the closest match is Question 1, but with a caveat that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything 
from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies 
on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body 
for menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around 
the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male 
and female hormones. In fact, men and women 
have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role 
in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals 
in the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones 
have unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function 
of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most 
common hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas 
secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much 
thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep 
our bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1960,
Frances Oldham Kelsey was one of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s newest recruits. Before the year was out, she would begin a fight that would 
save thousands of lives, though no one knew it at the time. Although she was new to the FDA,
Kelsey was no novice as a scientist. After graduating 
from high school at age 15, she enrolled 
at McGill University in Montreal and earned both undergraduate 
and master’s degrees in pharmacology. From there, she applied
for a research post at the University of Chicago’s
pharmacology department. Her acceptance letter was addressed 
to Mr. Oldham. Kelsey later joked that had her name 
been Elizabeth or Mary Jane, her career might have ended there. Fortunately, it didn’t. She earned her doctorate
in pharmacology and accepted Chicago’s invitation 
to stay as faculty, where she undertook pioneering
research on drugs and fetal safety. In 1950, she earned an MD, 
her fourth and final degree. By the time she joined the FDA, Frances Kelsey was one of the most
educated, experienced scientists around. Yet, as the newest member
of the team, Kelsey was assigned what everyone 
thought would be an easy review: an application from the
US drug company Merrell to sell a drug called thalidomide. Thalidomide was a sedative 
developed in Germany that was already being widely used 
in dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress. Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties also made it a popular remedy for pregnant
women with morning sickness. Reviewing Merrell’s application, Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s
absorption and toxicity inadequate. Today, the FDA classifies drugs based 
on their safety for a fetus. But in 1960, many experts believed 
that the placental barrier shielded a fetus from harm. Kelsey's earlier animal-based research demonstrated the opposite: drugs could pass from mother 
to fetus through the placenta. Like other drug companies at this time, Merrell had not tested its drug 
on pregnant animals. Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence 
for thalidomide’s safety seemed “more like testimonials than
the results of well-designed studies.” Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application and asked them to submit a second 
backed by better evidence. Her FDA colleagues 
supported this decision. Merrell had expected a quick, 
affirmative reply so it could launch thalidomide
for the holiday season, when sedative sales soar. Instead of supplying Kelsey
with the data she requested they first tried to convince her
to approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file 
another application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed 
and rejected each new application, news of thalidomide’s adverse 
side effects began to surface. Doctors reported cases of nerve damage 
in early 1961, and by fall,
they’d unmasked a more horrible truth. Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant
women, caused severe birth defects. Thousands of babies died in utero, and tens of thousands more 
were born with extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all. In November 1961, thalidomide 
was pulled from the German market. Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying 
to get it approved in the US for several months before withdrawing 
their sixth and final application. While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist 
to identify the risks of thalidomide, she sounded the alarm that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar 
American drug market. As public awareness 
of the thalidomide tragedy grew, the quiet scientist 
became a media sensation. Headlines in newspapers 
and magazines heralded her heroism while a smiling President John F. Kennedy presented her an award 
on the White House lawn. After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that expanded 
the FDA’s authority and toughened requirements 
for new drug applications. Kelsey was tapped to head 
the agency’s drug investigation branch. Working at the FDA in
different capacities into her 90s, Kelsey was able to witness the changes 
her actions helped inspire. Her visibility may have dimmed since,
but her legacy endures. Privileging facts over opinions, 
and patience over shortcuts, she made evidence-based medicine
the foundation of reforms that continue to protect people today.

to approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file 
another application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed 
and rejected each new application, news of thalidomide’s adverse 
side effects began to surface. Doctors reported cases of nerve damage 
in early 1961, and by fall,
they’d unmasked a more horrible truth. Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant
women, caused severe birth defects. Thousands of babies died in utero, and tens of thousands more 
were born with extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all. In November 1961, thalidomide 
was pulled from the German market. Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying 
to get it approved in the US for several months before withdrawing 
their sixth and final application. While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist 
to identify the risks of thalidomide, she sounded the alarm that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar 
American drug market. As public awareness 
of the thalidomide tragedy grew, the quiet scientist 
became a media sensation. Headlines in newspapers 
and magazines heralded her heroism while a smiling President John F. Kennedy presented her an award 
on the White House lawn. After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that expanded 
the FDA’s authority and toughened requirements 
for new drug applications. Kelsey was tapped to head 
the agency’s drug investigation branch. Working at the FDA in
different capacities into her 90s, Kelsey was able to witness the changes 
her actions helped inspire. Her visibility may have dimmed since,
but her legacy endures. Privileging facts over opinions, 
and patience over shortcuts, she made evidence-based medicine
the foundation of reforms that continue to protect people today.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the properties of thalidomide, and the correct answer is that it is a sedative used to treat insomnia, workplace stress, and nausea.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is somewhat related to thalidomide, but it asks about why Merrell wanted to launch thalidomide for the holiday season, not about the properties of thalidomide itself.

However, I can suggest that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it asks about the outcome of the continued use of thalidomide by pregnant women, which is related to the properties of thalidomide. But it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 6, but please note that it's not a perfect match.

It would be better to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the properties of thalidomide, such as:

What is thalidomide primarily used for?
Options: A. A sedative used to treat insomnia, workplace stress, and nausea, B. A stimulant used to increase dopamine, C. A depressant used to calm nerves and relax muscles, D. An alcoholic beverage

This new MCQ would be a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1960,
Frances Oldham Kelsey was one of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s newest recruits. Before the year was out, she would begin a fight that would 
save thousands of lives, though no one knew it at the time. Although she was new to the FDA,
Kelsey was no novice as a scientist. After graduating 
from high school at age 15, she enrolled 
at McGill University in Montreal and earned both undergraduate 
and master’s degrees in pharmacology. From there, she applied
for a research post at the University of Chicago’s
pharmacology department. Her acceptance letter was addressed 
to Mr. Oldham. Kelsey later joked that had her name 
been Elizabeth or Mary Jane, her career might have ended there. Fortunately, it didn’t. She earned her doctorate
in pharmacology and accepted Chicago’s invitation 
to stay as faculty, where she undertook pioneering
research on drugs and fetal safety. In 1950, she earned an MD, 
her fourth and final degree. By the time she joined the FDA, Frances Kelsey was one of the most
educated, experienced scientists around. Yet, as the newest member
of the team, Kelsey was assigned what everyone 
thought would be an easy review: an application from the
US drug company Merrell to sell a drug called thalidomide. Thalidomide was a sedative 
developed in Germany that was already being widely used 
in dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress. Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties also made it a popular remedy for pregnant
women with morning sickness. Reviewing Merrell’s application, Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s
absorption and toxicity inadequate. Today, the FDA classifies drugs based 
on their safety for a fetus. But in 1960, many experts believed 
that the placental barrier shielded a fetus from harm. Kelsey's earlier animal-based research demonstrated the opposite: drugs could pass from mother 
to fetus through the placenta. Like other drug companies at this time, Merrell had not tested its drug 
on pregnant animals. Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence 
for thalidomide’s safety seemed “more like testimonials than
the results of well-designed studies.” Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application and asked them to submit a second 
backed by better evidence. Her FDA colleagues 
supported this decision. Merrell had expected a quick, 
affirmative reply so it could launch thalidomide
for the holiday season, when sedative sales soar. Instead of supplying Kelsey
with the data she requested they first tried to convince her
to approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file 
another application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, Question 4: "What was the result of Frances Kelsey's review of Merrell's initial application for thalidomide?" mentions that Frances Kelsey worked at the FDA, as it is stated that she reviewed an application as part of her job.

However, if we were to choose a question that is tangentially related to the ground truth MCQ, it would be Question 4, but keep in mind that it does not directly ask about Frances Kelsey's workplace.

A more suitable answer would be to create a new question that explicitly asks about Frances Kelsey's workplace in the 1960s.

That being said, if I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but with the caveat that it does not directly address the question of where Frances Kelsey worked.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1960,
Frances Oldham Kelsey was one of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s newest recruits. Before the year was out, she would begin a fight that would 
save thousands of lives, though no one knew it at the time. Although she was new to the FDA,
Kelsey was no novice as a scientist. After graduating 
from high school at age 15, she enrolled 
at McGill University in Montreal and earned both undergraduate 
and master’s degrees in pharmacology. From there, she applied
for a research post at the University of Chicago’s
pharmacology department. Her acceptance letter was addressed 
to Mr. Oldham. Kelsey later joked that had her name 
been Elizabeth or Mary Jane, her career might have ended there. Fortunately, it didn’t. She earned her doctorate
in pharmacology and accepted Chicago’s invitation 
to stay as faculty, where she undertook pioneering
research on drugs and fetal safety. In 1950, she earned an MD, 
her fourth and final degree. By the time she joined the FDA, Frances Kelsey was one of the most
educated, experienced scientists around. Yet, as the newest member
of the team, Kelsey was assigned what everyone 
thought would be an easy review: an application from the
US drug company Merrell to sell a drug called thalidomide. Thalidomide was a sedative 
developed in Germany that was already being widely used 
in dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress. Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties also made it a popular remedy for pregnant
women with morning sickness. Reviewing Merrell’s application, Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s
absorption and toxicity inadequate. Today, the FDA classifies drugs based 
on their safety for a fetus. But in 1960, many experts believed 
that the placental barrier shielded a fetus from harm. Kelsey's earlier animal-based research demonstrated the opposite: drugs could pass from mother 
to fetus through the placenta. Like other drug companies at this time, Merrell had not tested its drug 
on pregnant animals. Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence 
for thalidomide’s safety seemed “more like testimonials than
the results of well-designed studies.” Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application and asked them to submit a second 
backed by better evidence. Her FDA colleagues 
supported this decision. Merrell had expected a quick, 
affirmative reply so it could launch thalidomide
for the holiday season, when sedative sales soar. Instead of supplying Kelsey
with the data she requested they first tried to convince her
to approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file 
another application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed 
and rejected each new application, news of thalidomide’s adverse 
side effects began to surface. Doctors reported cases of nerve damage 
in early 1961, and by fall,
they’d unmasked a more horrible truth. Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant
women, caused severe birth defects. Thousands of babies died in utero, and tens of thousands more 
were born with extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all. In November 1961, thalidomide 
was pulled from the German market. Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying 
to get it approved in the US for several months before withdrawing 
their sixth and final application. While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist 
to identify the risks of thalidomide, she sounded the alarm that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar 
American drug market. As public awareness 
of the thalidomide tragedy grew, the quiet scientist 
became a media sensation. Headlines in newspapers 
and magazines heralded her heroism while a smiling President John F. Kennedy presented her an award 
on the White House lawn. After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that expanded 
the FDA’s authority and toughened requirements 
for new drug applications. Kelsey was tapped to head 
the agency’s drug investigation branch. Working at the FDA in
different capacities into her 90s, Kelsey was able to witness the changes 
her actions helped inspire. Her visibility may have dimmed since,
but her legacy endures. Privileging facts over opinions, 
and patience over shortcuts, she made evidence-based medicine
the foundation of reforms that continue to protect people today.

**Transcript**:
You roll out of bed and leap eight meters 
across your underground habitat. The greywater from your sink
drains into a small greenhouse where your vegetables grow. After suiting up, you head through a transport 
chute to inspect the generator. Outside, it’s pitch black - just as 
it’s been for the last 12 days. This isn’t some post-apocalyptic scenario;
it’s just another day of life on the moon. And with the European Space Agency’s idea to establish a functioning 
"moon camp" by the 2020s, that day may be
closer than we think. Of course, living on 
the moon won’t be easy. The camp envisioned is not so much
a village as an inhabited research base similar to those 
in places like Antarctica. But there are far greater obstacles to
living on the moon than just cold weather. The biggest is cosmic radiation. Unlike the Earth, the moon has 
no atmosphere and no magnetic field. A person on its surface can receive 
over 400 times the maximum safe dosage of heavy ion radiation, enough to be fatal within ten hours, 
even in a spacesuit. The first step would likely involve robots and 3D printers constructing 
covered habitats from lunar soil, or building shelters inside caves formed by lava tubes 
from the moon’s volcanic past. But what would the inhabitants live on? Supplies would need to be transported 
from Earth at first. Growing plants requires greenhouse soil 
and air rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that’s rare on the moon, but could be synthesized 
from recycled materials. A water treatment plant could be supplied 
by ice mined from the polar regions using a specialized drill that can bore 
two meters beneath the lunar surface. Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary 
to the human microbiome and immune system would also have to be imported 
or synthesized on site. And lunar inhabitants would have 
to exercise for hours a day to maintain bone and muscle mass. That’s because the moon’s gravity 
is just one-sixth that of the Earth, and the everyday strain of working 
against gravity is part of what keeps our bodies healthy. It might seem strange to go 
to all this trouble to build a base on a dead rock 
we’ve already visited. But NASA’s Apollo missions only explored 
small portions of the moon. We’ve made many discoveries since then, such as ice near the poles and particles 
of solar wind gases that date back billions of years. They collectively show that the moon 
has much more to teach us about the history of our solar system. A radio telescope on its far side could 
observe the cosmos, shielded from the Earth’s electromagnetic
interference. And the lunar surface is rich in minerals,
like silicon, aluminum, and magnesium, creating great economic 
potential for mining. But the biggest benefit of the moon camp 
may not lie on the moon but beyond it. With the nearest possibly habitable 
world light-years away, and the International Space Station 
to be retired in about a decade, a moon base would be our first foothold towards becoming 
an interplanetary species. And proposals such as 
the Deep Space Gateway envision launching future 
missions from lunar orbit. The smaller gravitational pull 
would require less fuel to overcome, allowing for larger ships and more cargo. Meanwhile, the base on the surface 
could serve as a testing ground for future space operations, a refueling station, and a supply depot all in one. With Europe, Russia, China, and the US 
expressing interest in the project, the moon camp may come to involve the space agencies of all major nations, 
as well as private companies. Within a few decades, the moon may be bustling 
with mining operations, research stations, and tourist routes alongside a construction yard 
under an orbiting space port. We may have already visited the moon, but now we’re closer than ever 
to making it part of humanity’s home.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is the effect of the moon's gravity on the human body, and how can it be mitigated?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about health hazards that moon village residents might face, and Question 4 addresses a specific health hazard related to the moon's gravity.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more similar in terms of options and intent, I would choose:

**None of the above**

The reason is that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about which option is NOT a health hazard, whereas the generated MCQs ask about specific aspects of living on the moon.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
You roll out of bed and leap eight meters 
across your underground habitat. The greywater from your sink
drains into a small greenhouse where your vegetables grow. After suiting up, you head through a transport 
chute to inspect the generator. Outside, it’s pitch black - just as 
it’s been for the last 12 days. This isn’t some post-apocalyptic scenario;
it’s just another day of life on the moon. And with the European Space Agency’s idea to establish a functioning 
"moon camp" by the 2020s, that day may be
closer than we think. Of course, living on 
the moon won’t be easy. The camp envisioned is not so much
a village as an inhabited research base similar to those 
in places like Antarctica. But there are far greater obstacles to
living on the moon than just cold weather. The biggest is cosmic radiation. Unlike the Earth, the moon has 
no atmosphere and no magnetic field. A person on its surface can receive 
over 400 times the maximum safe dosage of heavy ion radiation, enough to be fatal within ten hours, 
even in a spacesuit. The first step would likely involve robots and 3D printers constructing 
covered habitats from lunar soil, or building shelters inside caves formed by lava tubes 
from the moon’s volcanic past. But what would the inhabitants live on? Supplies would need to be transported 
from Earth at first. Growing plants requires greenhouse soil 
and air rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that’s rare on the moon, but could be synthesized 
from recycled materials. A water treatment plant could be supplied 
by ice mined from the polar regions using a specialized drill that can bore 
two meters beneath the lunar surface. Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary 
to the human microbiome and immune system would also have to be imported

**Transcript**:
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks, formed by five streets that 
run west to east, intersecting five more 
that run north to south. You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax 
on all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive 
at their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east, and doubles for every block 
you walk south. However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer halves your total bill for
every block you walk north and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice 
in any direction? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map 
to consider your options. Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver. But what happens when you walk 
around a single block? If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again 
and going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller 
than it started. The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way
to reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city. From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple. As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If the pilgrim traveled east, east, south, south, south, south to reach the temple, what would his tax be?
Options: A. 100, B. 64, C. 128, D. 256
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: What is the initial tax that a visitor owes after passing through the gate and the welcome center in Duonia? Options: A. 0 silver, B. 2 silver, C. 4 silver, D. 6 silver Correct Option: C
Question 2: How does the tax change when a visitor walks a block east in Duonia? Options: A. It decreases by 2 silver, B. It increases by 2 silver, C. It doubles, D. It halves Correct Option: B
Question 3: What is the effect of walking a block north on the total tax bill in Duonia? Options: A. It doubles the bill, B. It halves the bill, C. It subtracts 2 silver, D. It adds 2 silver Correct Option: B
Question 4: What is the pilgrim's goal in Duonia, and what constraints do they face? Options: A. Reach the temple without walking the same block twice, but can earn money to pay the tax, B. Reach the temple without owing any tax, but can walk the same block multiple times, C. Reach the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice, and cannot earn money, D.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the tax owed by the pilgrim after traveling a specific route to the temple. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, which asks about the pilgrim's final tax bill after walking the remaining blocks to the temple. Although the routes and tax calculations are different, both questions are related to the pilgrim's tax bill after reaching the temple.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of calculating the tax owed after traveling a specific route, I would choose Question 5 or Question 6. These questions ask about the effect of walking a single loop around a block on the tax bill, which is related to the concept of calculating the tax owed after traveling a specific route.

But, if I had to choose one generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2. This question asks about how the tax changes when a visitor walks a block east in Duonia, which is related to the concept of calculating the tax owed after traveling a specific route.

at their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east, and doubles for every block 
you walk south. However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer halves your total bill for
every block you walk north and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice 
in any direction? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map 
to consider your options. Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver. But what happens when you walk 
around a single block? If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again 
and going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller 
than it started. The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way
to reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city. From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple. As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the tax owed by the pilgrim after traveling a specific route to the temple. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, which asks about the pilgrim's final tax bill after walking the remaining blocks to the temple. Although the routes and tax calculations are different, both questions are related to the pilgrim's tax bill after reaching the temple.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of calculating the tax owed after traveling a specific route, I would choose Question 5 or Question 6. These questions ask about the effect of walking a single loop around a block on the tax bill, which is related to the concept of calculating the tax owed after traveling a specific route.

But, if I had to choose one generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2. This question asks about how the tax changes when a visitor walks a block east in Duonia, which is related to the concept of calculating the tax owed after traveling a specific route.

**Transcript**:
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks, formed by five streets that 
run west to east, intersecting five more 
that run north to south. You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the tax amount after a specific sequence of movements (south, south, south, south, east, east). The generated MCQs do not have a similar question. However, some generated MCQs ask about the tax changes when walking in specific directions (e.g., Question 2, Question 3, Question 5, and Question 6).

Among these, Question 2 is the most similar, as it asks about the tax change when walking a block east, which is part of the sequence in the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not ask about the cumulative effect of multiple movements.

Since none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is most related to the ground truth MCQ, which is:

 Question 2

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not cover the same scenario as the ground truth MCQ.

Ground Truth MCQ: "If the pilgrim looped back to where she started, she would owe the same tax."
Generated MCQ 5: "What happens to the tax bill when a visitor walks a single clockwise loop around a block in Duonia?"

Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the concept of looping and its effect on the tax bill. The ground truth MCQ implies that looping back to the starting point would not result in owing the same tax, while Generated MCQ 5 explains what happens to the tax bill when walking a single clockwise loop.

However, a closer match is not available among the generated MCQs, as none of them directly addresses the concept of looping back to the starting point.

However, a more relevant question that requires understanding of the city's layout is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 8

However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that directly asks about the number of blocks the town consists of would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks, formed by five streets that 
run west to east, intersecting five more 
that run north to south. You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax 
on all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive 
at their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east, and doubles for every block 
you walk south. However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer halves your total bill for
every block you walk north and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice 
in any direction? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map 
to consider your options. Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver. But what happens when you walk 
around a single block? If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again 
and going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller 
than it started. The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way
to reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city. From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple. As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**None of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.**

The ground truth MCQ asks about who is subject to the unique tax imposed by Duonia. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 4 mentions the pilgrim's goal in Duonia and the constraints they face, which includes the fact that they are a visitor and are subject to the tax.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest:

**Question 1**

This question asks about the initial tax owed by a visitor after passing through the gate and the welcome center in Duonia. While it does not directly ask about who is subject to the tax, it implies that visitors are subject to the tax.

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a new generated MCQ that directly asks about who is subject to the tax would be a better match.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about who is subject to the tax imposed by Duonia.

**Transcript**:
In 1963, a 21-year-old physicist 
named Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a rare
neuromuscular disorder called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
or ALS. Gradually, he lost the ability to walk, use his hands, move his face, and even swallow. But throughout it all,
he retained his incredible intellect, and in the more
than 50 years that followed, Hawking became one of history’s most 
accomplished and famous physicists. However, his condition went uncured and he passed away in 2018 
at the age of 76. Decades after his diagnosis, ALS still ranks as one 
of the most complex, mysterious, and devastating 
diseases to affect humankind. Also called motor neuron disease 
and Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS affects about two out of every
100,000 people worldwide. When a person has ALS, their motor neurons, the cells responsible for all voluntary 
muscle control in the body, lose function and die. No one knows exactly why
or how these cells die and that’s part of what 
makes ALS so hard to treat. In about 90% of cases, the disease arises suddenly, 
with no apparent cause. The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary, where a mother or father with ALS passes 
on a mutated gene to their child. The symptoms typically first appear 
after age 40. But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s,
ALS starts earlier in life. Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel 
because of how long he lived with ALS. After diagnosis, most people with 
the disease live between 2 to 5 years before ALS leads to respiratory problems 
that usually cause death. What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case
was that his ability to learn, think, and perceive with his senses 
remained intact. Most people with ALS do not experience
impaired cognition. With so much at stake 
for the 120,000 people who are diagnosed with ALS annually, curing the disease has become one of 
our most important scientific and medical challenges. Despite the many unknowns, we do have some insight into how ALS 
impacts the neuromuscular system. ALS affects two types of nerve cells 
called the upper and lower motor neurons. In a healthy body, 
the upper motor neurons, which sit in the brain’s cortex, transmit messages
from the brain to the lower motor neurons, situated in the spinal cord. Those neurons then transmit 
the message into muscle fibers, which contract or relax in response, resulting in motion. Every voluntary move we make occurs because of messages transmitted 
along this pathway. But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS, their ability to transfer 
messages is disrupted, and that vital signaling system 
is thrown into chaos. Without their regular cues, 
the muscles waste away. Precisely what makes 
the motor neurons degenerate is the prevailing 
mystery of ALS. In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic 
mutations on to their children. Even then, ALS involves multiple genes with multiple possible impacts 
on motor neurons, making the precise triggers
hard to pinpoint. When ALS arises sporadically,
the list of possible causes grows: toxins, viruses, lifestyle, or other environmental factors 
may all play roles. And because there are 
so many elements involved, there’s currently no single test that
can determine whether someone has ALS. Nevertheless, our hypotheses 
on the causes are developing. One prevailing idea is that certain
proteins inside the motor neurons aren’t folding correctly, and are instead forming clumps. The misfolded proteins and clumps 
may spread from cell to cell. This could be clogging up normal
cellular processes, like energy and protein production, 
which keep cells alive. We’ve also learned that along with 
motor neurons and muscle fibers, ALS could involve other
cell types. ALS patients typically have inflammation 
in their brains and spinal cords. Defective immune cells may also play 
a role in killing motor neurons. And ALS seems to change the
behavior of specific cells that provide support for neurons. These factors highlight 
the disease’s complexity, but they may also give us a fuller
understanding of how it works, opening up new avenues for treatment. And while that may be gradual,
we’re making progress all the time. We’re currently developing new drugs, new stem cell therapies 
to repair damaged cells, and new gene therapies 
to slow the advancement of the disease. With our growing arsenal of knowledge, we look forward to discoveries
that can change the future for people living with ALS.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is the primary difference between hereditary and sporadic cases of ALS? Options: A. Age of onset, B. Presence of genetic mutations, C. Rate of disease progression, D. Effect on cognitive function Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. 

A more similar question would be one that asks about the percentage of ALS cases that are not hereditary. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if we had to choose one, it would be **Question 4**, as it talks about the difference between hereditary and sporadic cases of ALS, which is related to the concept of the ground truth MCQ.

However, since the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it would be more accurate to say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say **4**, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ, such as:

**Question: What percentage of ALS cases are not hereditary? Options: A. About 10%, B. About 40%, C. About 50%, D. About 90% Correct Option: D**

This new MCQ would be a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1963, a 21-year-old physicist 
named Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a rare
neuromuscular disorder called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
or ALS. Gradually, he lost the ability to walk, use his hands, move his face, and even swallow. But throughout it all,
he retained his incredible intellect, and in the more
than 50 years that followed, Hawking became one of history’s most 
accomplished and famous physicists. However, his condition went uncured and he passed away in 2018 
at the age of 76. Decades after his diagnosis, ALS still ranks as one 
of the most complex, mysterious, and devastating 
diseases to affect humankind. Also called motor neuron disease 
and Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS affects about two out of every
100,000 people worldwide. When a person has ALS, their motor neurons, the cells responsible for all voluntary 
muscle control in the body, lose function and die. No one knows exactly why
or how these cells die and that’s part of what 
makes ALS so hard to treat. In about 90% of cases, the disease arises suddenly, 
with no apparent cause. The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary, where a mother or father with ALS passes 
on a mutated gene to their child. The symptoms typically first appear 
after age 40. But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s,
ALS starts earlier in life. Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel 
because of how long he lived with ALS. After diagnosis, most people with 
the disease live between 2 to 5 years before ALS leads to respiratory problems 
that usually cause death. What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case
was that his ability to learn, think, and perceive with his senses 
remained intact. Most people with ALS do not experience
impaired cognition. With so much at stake 
for the 120,000 people who are diagnosed with ALS annually, curing the disease has become one of 
our most important scientific and medical challenges. Despite the many unknowns, we do have some insight into how ALS 
impacts the neuromuscular system. ALS affects two types of nerve cells 
called the upper and lower motor neurons. In a healthy body, 
the upper motor neurons, which sit in the brain’s cortex, transmit messages
from the brain to the lower motor neurons, situated in the spinal cord. Those neurons then transmit 
the message into muscle fibers, which contract or relax in response, resulting in motion. Every voluntary move we make occurs because of messages transmitted 
along this pathway. But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS, their ability to transfer 
messages is disrupted, and that vital signaling system 
is thrown into chaos. Without their regular cues, 
the muscles waste away. Precisely what makes 
the motor neurons degenerate is the prevailing 
mystery of ALS. In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic 
mutations on to their children. Even then, ALS involves multiple genes with multiple possible impacts 
on motor neurons, making the precise triggers
hard to pinpoint. When ALS arises sporadically,
the list of possible causes grows: toxins, viruses, lifestyle, or other environmental factors 
may all play roles. And because there are 
so many elements involved, there’s currently no single test that
can determine whether someone has ALS. Nevertheless, our hypotheses 
on the causes are developing. One prevailing idea is that certain
proteins inside the motor neurons aren’t folding correctly, and are instead forming clumps. The misfolded proteins and clumps 
may spread from cell to cell. This could be clogging up normal
cellular processes, like energy and protein production, 
which keep cells alive. We’ve also learned that along with 
motor neurons and muscle fibers, ALS could involve other
cell types. ALS patients typically have inflammation 
in their brains and spinal cords. Defective immune cells may also play 
a role in killing motor neurons. And ALS seems to change the
behavior of specific cells that provide support for neurons. These factors highlight 
the disease’s complexity, but they may also give us a fuller
understanding of how it works, opening up new avenues for treatment. And while that may be gradual,
we’re making progress all the time. We’re currently developing new drugs, new stem cell therapies 
to repair damaged cells, and new gene therapies 
to slow the advancement of the disease. With our growing arsenal of knowledge, we look forward to discoveries
that can change the future for people living with ALS.

**Transcript**:
On July 4, 2015, a NASA spacecraft called New Horizons 
was 5 billion kilometers away from Earth. It was only 10 days away from Pluto, 
after flying for 9.5 years, when it suddenly dropped out of contact. But let’s back up a little. As of 1989, mankind had successfully sent craft 
to every known planet in the solar system except one—Pluto. You may have heard that astronomers 
don’t consider Pluto or its brethren to be planets. However, most planetary 
scientists still do, which is why we're using 
that terminology here. There’s a limited amount 
we can learn about Pluto from Earth because it’s so far from us. Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine. It’s located in a region 
called the Kuiper Belt, home to many small planets, hundreds of thousands 
of ancient icy objects, and trillions of comets. This mysterious region holds clues 
to the formation of our solar system, and it was long, 
tantalizingly beyond our reach. Until New Horizons. Its objectives: explore Pluto, collect as much scientific 
data as possible, transmit it back to Earth, then explore farther out 
in the Kuiper Belt. To achieve this, the New Horizons team 
outfitted their craft with seven state-of-the-art 
scientific instruments. Those included Ralph, a set of cameras powerful enough to capture features the size 
of city blocks in Manhattan from tens of thousands of kilometers away. And REX, designed to use radio waves to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure 
and temperature. All of the onboard equipment had to be
built to be both reliable and lightweight because New Horizons had an
additional challenge; it had to reach its target 
as fast as possible. Why? Around 2020, Pluto will reach 
a point in its orbit where its atmosphere could freeze. And due to the tilt of its axis, more and more of Pluto’s surface 
is shrouded in darkness every year. Pluto completes a full orbit
once every 248 Earth years, so it would be a long wait 
for the next prime opportunity to visit. To see how New Horizons 
got to Pluto in time, let’s jump to its launch. Its three rocket stages accelerated 
New Horizons to such great speeds that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers 
to the moon in just nine hours. About a year later, 
the craft reached Jupiter and got what’s called a gravity assist. That’s where it flies close enough
to the gas giant to receive a gravitational
slingshot effect. New Horizons was then flying 
at around 50,000 kilometers per hour, as it would for the next eight years 
to cross the remaining gulf to Pluto. Going at such an astonishing speed meant that slowing down 
to get into orbit or land would’ve been impossible. That’s why New Horizons was on 
a flyby mission, where it would get just one chance to
scream by Pluto and make its observations. The flyby would have 
to be fully automated, since at that distance, any signals 
to guide it from Earth would take 4.5 hours to reach it. So the team loaded the ship’s computer 
with a series of thousands of commands, called the core load, that would begin to execute 
when the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto. But when New Horizons 
was just ten days out, disaster almost struck. Ground control lost contact 
with the spacecraft. After two nerve-wracking hours,
New Horizons came back online, but mission control discovered 
that its main computer had rebooted, losing the entire core load 
and other critical data. Without that, it would soon 
whizz by Pluto with virtually nothing 
to show for the mission. Alice Bowman, 
the mission’s Operations Manager, led a team for 72 sleepless hours 
to get the instructions loaded back into New Horizons in time. Without room for a single error,
she and her team pulled it off, and New Horizons began taking 
and broadcasting breathtaking images. Those observations have revealed 
a delightfully varied world, with ground fogs, high altitude hazes, possible clouds, canyons, towering mountains, faults, craters, polar caps, glaciers, apparent dune fields, suspected ice volcanoes, evidence for past flowing liquids, and more. One of the most exciting discoveries is the 1000-kilometer-wide
Sputnik Planitia glacier. Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed 
of slowly churning frozen nitrogen, and we’ve never seen anything 
like it in our solar system. The exploration of Pluto 
was a great success, but New Horizons isn’t done yet. On January 1, 2019, it’ll break its own record for 
furthest explored object when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object 
called 2014 MU69, which is orbiting the sun another billion
kilometers farther away than Pluto. The world is holding its breath 
to see what it’ll find there.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: Why did astronomers consider Pluto a "scientific goldmine"?**

Although this question does not directly ask about Pluto's location, one of its options (B) mentions "its unique composition and location in the Kuiper Belt", which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more relevant question is not explicitly present in the generated MCQs, but we can consider another question that has a location-related aspect:

**Question 1: What was the primary objective of the New Horizons spacecraft?**

Options: A. To explore Mars and its moons, B. To collect scientific data from Pluto and the Kuiper Belt, C. To study the atmosphere of Jupiter, D. To search for life on Europa

This question mentions the Kuiper Belt, which is the correct location of Pluto.

But if I had to choose the most similar question based on the intent of asking about a location or a region in our solar system, I would choose:

**Question 10: What is the next destination for the New Horizons spacecraft?**

Options: A. A Kuiper Belt Object called 2014 MU69, B. The dwarf planet Eris, C. The planet Neptune, D. The asteroid belt

This question mentions the Kuiper Belt, which is the correct location of Pluto.

However, none of these questions is a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 2** is the most similar, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
On July 4, 2015, a NASA spacecraft called New Horizons 
was 5 billion kilometers away from Earth. It was only 10 days away from Pluto, 
after flying for 9.5 years, when it suddenly dropped out of contact. But let’s back up a little. As of 1989, mankind had successfully sent craft 
to every known planet in the solar system except one—Pluto. You may have heard that astronomers 
don’t consider Pluto or its brethren to be planets. However, most planetary 
scientists still do, which is why we're using 
that terminology here. There’s a limited amount 
we can learn about Pluto from Earth because it’s so far from us. Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine. It’s located in a region 
called the Kuiper Belt, home to many small planets, hundreds of thousands 
of ancient icy objects, and trillions of comets. This mysterious region holds clues 
to the formation of our solar system, and it was long, 
tantalizingly beyond our reach. Until New Horizons. Its objectives: explore Pluto, collect as much scientific 
data as possible, transmit it back to Earth, then explore farther out 
in the Kuiper Belt. To achieve this, the New Horizons team 
outfitted their craft with seven state-of-the-art 
scientific instruments. Those included Ralph, a set of cameras powerful enough to capture features the size 
of city blocks in Manhattan from tens of thousands of kilometers away. And REX, designed to use radio waves to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure 
and temperature. All of the onboard equipment had to be
built to be both reliable and lightweight because New Horizons had an
additional challenge; it had to reach its target 
as fast as possible. Why? Around 2020, Pluto will reach 
a point in its orbit where its atmosphere could freeze. And due to the tilt of its axis, more and more of Pluto’s surface 
is shrouded in darkness every year. Pluto completes a full orbit
once every 248 Earth years, so it would be a long wait 
for the next prime opportunity to visit. To see how New Horizons 
got to Pluto in time, let’s jump to its launch. Its three rocket stages accelerated 
New Horizons to such great speeds that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers 
to the moon in just nine hours. About a year later, 
the craft reached Jupiter and got what’s called a gravity assist. That’s where it flies close enough
to the gas giant to receive a gravitational
slingshot effect. New Horizons was then flying 
at around 50,000 kilometers per hour, as it would for the next eight years 
to cross the remaining gulf to Pluto. Going at such an astonishing speed meant that slowing down 
to get into orbit or land would’ve been impossible. That’s why New Horizons was on 
a flyby mission, where it would get just one chance to
scream by Pluto and make its observations. The flyby would have 
to be fully automated, since at that distance, any signals 
to guide it from Earth would take 4.5 hours to reach it. So the team loaded the ship’s computer 
with a series of thousands of commands, called the core load, that would begin to execute 
when the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto. But when New Horizons 
was just ten days out, disaster almost struck. Ground control lost contact 
with the spacecraft. After two nerve-wracking hours,
New Horizons came back online, but mission control discovered 
that its main computer had rebooted, losing the entire core load 
and other critical data. Without that, it would soon 
whizz by Pluto with virtually nothing 
to show for the mission. Alice Bowman, 
the mission’s Operations Manager, led a team for 72 sleepless hours 
to get the instructions loaded back into New Horizons in time. Without room for a single error,
she and her team pulled it off, and New Horizons began taking 
and broadcasting breathtaking images. Those observations have revealed 
a delightfully varied world, with ground fogs, high altitude hazes, possible clouds, canyons, towering mountains, faults, craters, polar caps, glaciers, apparent dune fields, suspected ice volcanoes, evidence for past flowing liquids, and more. One of the most exciting discoveries is the 1000-kilometer-wide
Sputnik Planitia glacier. Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed 
of slowly churning frozen nitrogen, and we’ve never seen anything 
like it in our solar system. The exploration of Pluto 
was a great success, but New Horizons isn’t done yet. On January 1, 2019, it’ll break its own record for 
furthest explored object when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object 
called 2014 MU69, which is orbiting the sun another billion
kilometers farther away than Pluto. The world is holding its breath 
to see what it’ll find there.

The finish line's in sight
and you put on an extra burst of speed. As your legs pick up the pace,
your breathing gets deeper, your heart pounds faster, and sweat pours over your skin. How does this substance
suddenly materialize and what exactly is its purpose? There are a number of scenarios
that can make us sweat: eating spicy foods, nervousness, and when we're sick. But exercise is probably the most familiar
and common. In that case, sweating happens 
as a response to movement triggered deep inside your cells. As you increase your pace,
your muscles work harder, increasing their demand for energy. A process called cellular respiration consumes glucose 
and oxygen to form ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Much of this process takes place
in structures called mitochondria. The more you move, the harder mitochondria work
to supply your body with energy. All this work comes at a cost, though. As the cells break down the ATP,
they release heat. The heat stimulates temperature sensors
throughout your body. Those receptors detect the excess heat
being produced by your muscle cells and communicate that information
to the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. The hypothalamus responds by sending signals out through 
the sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands in your skin. These are distributed all over the body with especially high concentrations
on the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, and on your head. When a sweat gland first receives
the signal, the fluid surrounding the cells
in its coiled base contains high amounts 
of sodium and chloride. The cells pump these ions
into a hollow tube that runs through the sweat gland. Then, because it's saltier inside
the tube than outside, water moves into the tube by osmosis. As what's called the primary secretion
builds up in the bottom of the tube, water pressure pushes it up
into the long straight part of the duct. Before it seeps onto the skin, cells lining the tube will reclaim
as much salt as possible so the process can continue. The water in sweat absorbs 
your body's heat energy and then evaporates off of you
when it reaches the surface, which in turn lowers your temperature. This process, 
known as evaporative cooling, was an important adaptation 
for our ancestors. This cooling effect isn't only helpful
during exercise. We sweat in many other scenarios, too. Eating particularly spicy food makes some
people sweat profusely from their faces. That happens because spices trigger
the same neural response in the brain that activates temperature receptors,
which usually respond to increased heat. Sweating is also part of 
the fight or flight response stimulated by stressful scenarios,
like asking someone on a date or interviewing for a job. This happens because adrenaline
stimulates muscle activity and causes blood vessels to widen, two responses that increase heat
and trigger the sweating response. And sweating also occurs 
when we get sick. When we're feverish,
we sweat because infections stimulate the hypothalamus 
to increase muscle activity, which in turn releases 
more energy as heat. That increases your overall temperature, a protective mechanism that makes your
body less habitable for infectious agents. Like with running, sweating helps
your body vent that heat. When the fever's over 
or you've won your race, your temperature receptors 
sense the decrease in heat and the hypothalamus brings 
your sweating response to an end. In some cases, like after a run, the hypothalamus also signals
to your body that you need to replenish the water
that you've oozed out. So, when you're pushing yourself
to reach that next goal, you can think of sweat as your body's
very own calibrator, enabling you to go that extra mile.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a scenario where a person will not sweat, and the correct option is "Overhydrating". Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest in terms of discussing a specific scenario where sweating occurs, but it's not a direct match.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that discusses different scenarios where sweating occurs or doesn't occur. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match this intent.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 3, which discusses a specific scenario where sweating occurs (eating spicy food). However, this is not a direct match, and the question intent is different.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (Note: This is not a direct match, but rather a suggestion of a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.)

**Transcript**:
Onboard the spacecraft, 
the astronauts preset the timer, enclose themselves in capsules, and fall into a deep hibernation that’ll carry them several 
hundred years into the future. This is a familiar scene 
in many sci-fi films, but could humans ever actually 
hibernate in real life? Researchers interested in this question 
turn to the animal kingdom, where hibernation is commonplace, occurring in over 200 species 
that we know of. Take the Arctic ground squirrel. Native to the North American tundra 
and northern Russia, this animal burrows 
beneath the permafrost and slips into a state 
of suspended animation, its body temperature plummeting 
to a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius. Others, like the female black bear, 
can multitask, giving birth and lactating while they’re
hibernating through the winter. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares 
for its long dormancy by gorging on food and storing the 
majority of its fat reserves in its tail, doubling its body weight. After hibernation, it emerges looking 
as svelte as ever. So why do these animals 
go to such extremes? Hibernation is a necessity, a survival tactic for making it 
through the harsh winter months when dwindling food 
and water reserves threaten survival. For many years, experts believed 
hibernation happened only in arctic and temperate environments. But more recently, they’ve discovered 
animals hibernating even in arid deserts 
and tropical rainforests. As hibernation kicks in, animals’ heartbeats usually slow to
about 1 to 3% of their original speed, like the dwarf lemur’s, which drops from its usual 
roughly 180 beats per minute to just around four. Breathing also declines dramatically to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes 
in the lemur’s case. And black bears, like most hibernators, don’t urinate 
or defecate the entire hibernation season. Hibernating animals appear to stay alive by having just enough blood
and oxygen moving around their bodies. And scans of hibernating animals 
reveal that their brain activity has just about flat-lined. But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap. As far as researchers know, in lemurs and
ground squirrels anyway, the animals aren’t even 
sleeping for most of it. Hibernation is actually made up of regular
bouts of reduced metabolic rate and body temperature known as torpor. Animals can be in torpor 
for a few days to five weeks, after which they resume normal 
metabolic rate and body temperature for about 24 hours, before going back into torpor again. The phenomenon is known 
as an interbout arousal, and why it occurs is still a mystery. The behaviors inherent in hibernation, like going five weeks without sleep, or dropping to 
near-freezing body temperatures would be potentially fatal 
to non-hibernating species like us. To find out how hibernators 
are able to do this, researchers turned their attention
to those animal’s genomes. So far, they’ve discovered that
hibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in
unique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology 
and behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear 
and dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these
animals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use 
their fat stores as fuel to survive 
long periods of fasting. And the genes in question 
are present in all mammals, which means that researchers could
study hibernating mammals to see how their unique control 
of physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal 
with reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments 
for protecting the brain during a stroke. Figuring out how these animals avoid
muscle deterioration might improve the lives 
of bedridden patients. And studying how hibernating animals 
control their weight with ease could illuminate the relationship between
metabolism and weight gain in humans. And yes, more research in this area might someday make 
human hibernation a real possibility. Imagine our surprise if the key to
intergalactic travel turns out to be ground squirrels, 
black bears, and dwarf lemurs.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of species known to hibernate, while the generated MCQs cover various aspects of hibernation, such as reasons for hibernation, physiological changes during hibernation, and potential benefits of studying hibernation.

Although there isn't a direct match, I would suggest that Question 8 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it mentions the adaptation of hibernation in different environments and implies the diversity of species that hibernate. However, it does not specifically ask about the number of species known to hibernate.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level due to the significant difference in question content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Onboard the spacecraft, 
the astronauts preset the timer, enclose themselves in capsules, and fall into a deep hibernation that’ll carry them several 
hundred years into the future. This is a familiar scene 
in many sci-fi films, but could humans ever actually 
hibernate in real life? Researchers interested in this question 
turn to the animal kingdom, where hibernation is commonplace, occurring in over 200 species 
that we know of. Take the Arctic ground squirrel. Native to the North American tundra 
and northern Russia, this animal burrows 
beneath the permafrost and slips into a state 
of suspended animation, its body temperature plummeting 
to a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius. Others, like the female black bear, 
can multitask, giving birth and lactating while they’re
hibernating through the winter. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares 
for its long dormancy by gorging on food and storing the 
majority of its fat reserves in its tail, doubling its body weight. After hibernation, it emerges looking 
as svelte as ever. So why do these animals 
go to such extremes? Hibernation is a necessity, a survival tactic for making it 
through the harsh winter months when dwindling food 
and water reserves threaten survival. For many years, experts believed 
hibernation happened only in arctic and temperate environments. But more recently, they’ve discovered 
animals hibernating even in arid deserts 
and tropical rainforests. As hibernation kicks in, animals’ heartbeats usually slow to
about 1 to 3% of their original speed, like the dwarf lemur’s, which drops from its usual 
roughly 180 beats per minute to just around four. Breathing also declines dramatically to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes 
in the lemur’s case. And black bears, like most hibernators, don’t urinate 
or defecate the entire hibernation season. Hibernating animals appear to stay alive by having just enough blood
and oxygen moving around their bodies. And scans of hibernating animals 
reveal that their brain activity has just about flat-lined. But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap. As far as researchers know, in lemurs and
ground squirrels anyway, the animals aren’t even 
sleeping for most of it. Hibernation is actually made up of regular
bouts of reduced metabolic rate and body temperature known as torpor. Animals can be in torpor 
for a few days to five weeks, after which they resume normal 
metabolic rate and body temperature for about 24 hours, before going back into torpor again. The phenomenon is known 
as an interbout arousal, and why it occurs is still a mystery. The behaviors inherent in hibernation, like going five weeks without sleep, or dropping to 
near-freezing body temperatures would be potentially fatal 
to non-hibernating species like us. To find out how hibernators 
are able to do this, researchers turned their attention
to those animal’s genomes. So far, they’ve discovered that
hibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in
unique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology 
and behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear 
and dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these
animals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use 
their fat stores as fuel to survive 
long periods of fasting. And the genes in question 
are present in all mammals, which means that researchers could
study hibernating mammals to see how their unique control 
of physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal 
with reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments 
for protecting the brain during a stroke. Figuring out how these animals avoid
muscle deterioration might improve the lives 
of bedridden patients. And studying how hibernating animals 
control their weight with ease could illuminate the relationship between
metabolism and weight gain in humans. And yes, more research in this area might someday make 
human hibernation a real possibility. Imagine our surprise if the key to
intergalactic travel turns out to be ground squirrels, 
black bears, and dwarf lemurs.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks for the term of the phenomenon, not the duration. 

A more similar question would be one that asks about the duration of torpor. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on the content related to torpor, I would choose:

As far as we know, there’s only one thing in our solar system
sophisticated enough to study itself: the human brain. But this self-investigation 
is incredibly challenging; a living brain is shielded 
by a thick skull, swaddled in layers of protective tissue, and made up of billions of tiny,
connected cells. That’s why it’s so difficult to isolate, 
observe, and understand diseases like Alzheimer’s. So how do we study living brains 
without harming their owners? We can use a trio of techniques 
called EEG, fMRI, and PET. Each measures something different 
and has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll look at each in turn. First is EEG, or electroencephalography, which measures electrical 
activity in your brain. As brain cells communicate, 
they produce waves of electricity. Electrodes placed on the skull pick
up these waves, and differences in the signals detected 
between electrodes provide information 
about what’s happening. This technique was invented 
almost 100 years ago, and it’s still used to diagnose conditions
like epilepsy and sleep disorders. It’s also used to investigate what areas 
of the brain are active during learning or paying attention. EEG is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and fast: it can measure changes that occur 
in just milliseconds. Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine exactly where any particular 
pattern originates. Electrical signals are generated 
constantly all over the brain and they interact with each other to
produce complex patterns. Using more electrodes or sophisticated 
data-processing algorithms can help. But in the end, while EEG can tell you 
precisely when certain activity occurs, it can’t tell you precisely where. To do that, you’d need another technique, such as functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, or fMRI. fMRI measures how quickly oxygen 
is consumed by brain cells. Active areas of the brain use
oxygen more quickly. So watching an fMRI scan while a person
completes cognitive or behavioral tasks can provide information about which 
regions of the brain might be involved. That allows us to study everything
from how we see faces to how we understand what we’re feeling. fMRI can pinpoint differences in brain
activity to within a few millimeters, but it’s thousands 
of times slower than EEG. Using the two techniques together can help show when,
and where, neural activity is occurring. The third, even more precise, technique
is called positron emission tomography and it measures radioactive elements 
introduced into the brain. That sounds much scarier 
than it actually is; PET scans, like fMRI and EEG, 
are completely safe. During a PET scan, a small amount
of radioactive material called a tracer is injected into the bloodstream, and doctors monitor its
circulation through the brain. By modifying the tracer
to bind to specific molecules, researchers can use PET to study 
the complex chemistry in our brains. It’s useful for studying 
how drugs affect the brain and detecting diseases like Alzheimer’s. But this technique has 
the lowest time resolution of all because it takes minutes for the tracer 
to circulate and changes to show up. These techniques collectively 
help doctors and scientists connect what happens in the
brain with our behavior. But they’re also limited 
by how much we still don't know. For example, let's say researchers are
interested in studying how memory works. After asking 50 participants to memorize 
a series of images while in MRI scanners, the researchers might analyze the results and discover a number 
of active brain regions. Making a link between memory 
and specific parts of the brain is an important step forward. But future research would be necessary to better understand 
what’s happening in each region, how they work together, and whether the activity is because 
of their involvement in memory or another process 
occurring simultaneously. More advanced imaging 
and analysis technology might one day provide 
more accurate results and even distinguish the activity of individual neurons. Until then, our brains will
keep measuring, analyzing, and innovating in pursuit of that quest to understand one of the most remarkable things 
we’ve ever encountered.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 3 provides a hint about the limitation of EEG, which is related to the spatial resolution, and Question 5 provides information about the advantage of fMRI over EEG in terms of spatial resolution.

However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask which technique provides the most precise information about when brain activity occurs. But considering the content of the transcript and the generated MCQs, we can infer that the most similar generated MCQ would be one that involves the comparison of the techniques in terms of their temporal resolution.

In this case, I would recommend Question 5 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with a note that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, considering the options provided, I would recommend Question 3's option C as a hint to the correct answer.

However, re-reading the generated MCQs, I found that Question 3's correct option (C) "It is difficult to determine exactly where a particular pattern originates"  implies the low spatial resolution of EEG but also implies the high temporal resolution of EEG as the transcript states "EEG can tell you precisely when certain activity occurs, it can’t tell you precisely where."

Therefore, I would recommend Question 3 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the understanding that the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (C. EEG) is inferred from the correct option of Question 3 (C) and the content of the transcript.

**Transcript**:
As far as we know, there’s only one thing in our solar system
sophisticated enough to study itself: the human brain. But this self-investigation 
is incredibly challenging; a living brain is shielded 
by a thick skull, swaddled in layers of protective tissue, and made up of billions of tiny,
connected cells. That’s why it’s so difficult to isolate, 
observe, and understand diseases like Alzheimer’s. So how do we study living brains 
without harming their owners? We can use a trio of techniques 
called EEG, fMRI, and PET. Each measures something different 
and has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll look at each in turn. First is EEG, or electroencephalography, which measures electrical 
activity in your brain. As brain cells communicate, 
they produce waves of electricity. Electrodes placed on the skull pick
up these waves, and differences in the signals detected 
between electrodes provide information 
about what’s happening. This technique was invented 
almost 100 years ago, and it’s still used to diagnose conditions
like epilepsy and sleep disorders. It’s also used to investigate what areas 
of the brain are active during learning or paying attention. EEG is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and fast: it can measure changes that occur 
in just milliseconds. Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine exactly where any particular 
pattern originates. Electrical signals are generated 
constantly all over the brain and they interact with each other to
produce complex patterns. Using more electrodes or sophisticated 
data-processing algorithms can help. But in the end, while EEG can tell you 
precisely when certain activity occurs, it can’t tell you precisely where. To do that, you’d need another technique, such as functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, or fMRI. fMRI measures how quickly oxygen 
is consumed by brain cells. Active areas of the brain use
oxygen more quickly. So watching an fMRI scan while a person
completes cognitive or behavioral tasks can provide information about which 
regions of the brain might be involved. That allows us to study everything
from how we see faces to how we understand what we’re feeling. fMRI can pinpoint differences in brain
activity to within a few millimeters, but it’s thousands 
of times slower than EEG. Using the two techniques together can help show when,
and where, neural activity is occurring. The third, even more precise, technique
is called positron emission tomography and it measures radioactive elements 
introduced into the brain. That sounds much scarier 
than it actually is; PET scans, like fMRI and EEG, 
are completely safe. During a PET scan, a small amount
of radioactive material called a tracer is injected into the bloodstream, and doctors monitor its
circulation through the brain. By modifying the tracer
to bind to specific molecules, researchers can use PET to study 
the complex chemistry in our brains. It’s useful for studying 
how drugs affect the brain and detecting diseases like Alzheimer’s. But this technique has 
the lowest time resolution of all because it takes minutes for the tracer 
to circulate and changes to show up. These techniques collectively 
help doctors and scientists connect what happens in the
brain with our behavior. But they’re also limited 
by how much we still don't know. For example, let's say researchers are
interested in studying how memory works. After asking 50 participants to memorize 
a series of images while in MRI scanners, the researchers might analyze the results and discover a number 
of active brain regions. Making a link between memory 
and specific parts of the brain is an important step forward. But future research would be necessary to better understand 
what’s happening in each region, how they work together, and whether the activity is because 
of their involvement in memory or another process 
occurring simultaneously. More advanced imaging 
and analysis technology might one day provide 
more accurate results and even distinguish the activity of individual neurons. Until then, our brains will
keep measuring, analyzing, and innovating in pursuit of that quest to understand one of the most remarkable things 
we’ve ever encountered.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

However, note that Question 5 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the advantage of fMRI over EEG, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks which technique can provide the most precise information about where brain activity occurs.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly compares the precision of the three techniques (EEG, fMRI, and PET) in localizing brain activity. Unfortunately, no such question exists among the provided generated MCQs.

That being said, if we had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, Question 5 would be the closest match, as it does mention the precision of fMRI in localizing brain activity.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: A researcher is interested in studying how memory works. What would be the best approach to take?**

However, upon closer inspection, I realize that this question doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the conclusion that can be drawn from observing activity in a specific part of the brain while a person performs a specific task.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 5: What is the advantage of using fMRI over EEG?**

However, this question still doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I realize that none of them exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

**Question 8: What is a limitation of current brain imaging techniques?**

However, I would like to note that this question is still not a perfect match.

If I were to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be something like:

**Question: If a researcher observes activity in a specific part of the brain while a person performs a specific task, what can they conclude about the relationship between the brain activity and the task?**

Options: A. There is a direct causal link between the brain activity and the task, B. The brain activity is only related to the task and not to any other process, C. There is some link between the brain activity and the task, but further research is needed to understand the nature of the relationship, D. There is no relationship between the brain activity and the task.

Correct Option: C.

However, since this question is not among the generated MCQs, I will choose the closest match, which is:

**Question 8: What is a limitation of current brain imaging techniques?**

However, please note that this is not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail. They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail. And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom. So what causes phantom limb sensations? The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains. And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map. But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful. To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain. Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space. Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord and up to the brain. Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself, most of it remains 
behind after an amputation. But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway. At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure. Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify. Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain. There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them. The entire body is mapped in this cortex. Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas. The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part. For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists. The brain also increases 
cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger. This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain. The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there, because they still 
have representation in the brain. Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it. But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own. Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time. A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb. The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror. This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it. Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike. Prosthetics can also 
create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove 
their prosthetics at night. And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize
prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively. There are still many questions 
about phantom limbs. We don’t know why some amputees
escape the pain typically associated 
with these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all. And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people 
who experience them. A deeper understanding 
of these apparitions will give us insight into the work
our brains do every day to build the world as we perceive it. They’re an important reminder that the realities we experience are,
in fact, subjective.

**Transcript**:
The vast majority of people 
who’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape,
but in complete lifelike detail. They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel 
the chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail. And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born 
without a limb can feel a phantom. So what causes phantom limb sensations? The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map 
of the body in our brains. And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb 
to feel one implies we are born with at least 
the beginnings of this map. But one thing sets the phantoms
that appear after amputation apart from their flesh 
and blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful. To fully understand phantom limbs 
and phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway 
from limb to brain. Our limbs are full of sensory neurons
responsible for everything from the textures we feel 
with our fingertips to our understanding 
of where our bodies are in space. Neural pathways carry this sensory input
through the spinal cord and up to the brain. Since so much of this path 
lies outside the limb itself, most of it remains 
behind after an amputation. But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel 
at every step of the pathway. At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken 
and become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals 
even in response to mild pressure. Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed 
in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For reasons we don’t fully understand,
after an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory
control in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify. Once they pass through the spinal cord,
sensory signals reach the brain. There, the somatosensory cortex 
processes them. The entire body is mapped in this cortex. Sensitive body parts 
with many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas. The cortical homunculus is a model 
of the human body with proportions based on the size of each
body part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted 
to a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input 
the brain receives from that body part. For example, representation of the left
hand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists. The brain also increases 
cortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations 
that alert us to danger. This increased representation 
can lead to phantom pain. The cortical map is also 
most likely responsible for the feeling of body parts 
that are no longer there, because they still 
have representation in the brain. Over time, this representation may shrink
and the phantom limb may shrink with it. But phantom limb sensations 
don’t necessarily disappear on their own. Treatment for phantom pain 
usually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time. A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing 
the range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb. The patient places the phantom limb 
into a box behind a mirror and the intact limb 
in front of the mirror. This tricks the brain 
into seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it. Scientists are developing 
virtual reality treatments that make the experience 
of mirror box therapy even more lifelike. Prosthetics can also 
create a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove 
their prosthetics at night. And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize
prosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively. There are still many questions 
about phantom limbs. We don’t know why some amputees
escape the pain typically associated 
with these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all. And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people 
who experience them. A deeper understanding 
of these apparitions will give us insight into the work

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse, rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover. To get some time alone together, the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks that involve feigning madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night 
to sing outside her house. This becomes so tiresome 
that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the window 
for him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides 
to try farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk 
is waiting with a red-hot poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters. Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English, which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today. It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact 
with European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English alphabet 
is still familiar today, with the inclusion 
of a few archaic symbols, such as yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales 
first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral. Eager and nosy
for some personal details, the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition: whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner. If not for their pilgrimage, many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact. This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a professional class of merchants 
and intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of his life 
as a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout Italy and France,
as well as his native England. This may have influenced
the panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales,
no level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses the quirks 
of the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The varied dialects, genres, 
and literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the different ways Medieval audiences 
entertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale 
of courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and slapstick. This variation 
includes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation. While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader
is free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A portly Miller, barely sober enough
to sit on his horse, rambles on about the flighty wife 
of a crotchety old carpenter and the scholar she takes as her lover. To get some time alone together, the scholar and the wife 
play various tricks that involve feigning madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk 
is also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night 
to sing outside her house. This becomes so tiresome 
that she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the window 
for him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides 
to try farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk 
is waiting with a red-hot poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed 
works of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends the lofty 
and the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one 
of Chaucer’s spirited characters. Narrators include 
familiar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English, which often looks entirely different 
from the language spoken today. It was used between the 12th 
and 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact 
with European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English alphabet 
is still familiar today, with the inclusion 
of a few archaic symbols, such as yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales 
first meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury 
to visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered 
in his own Cathedral. Eager and nosy
for some personal details, the host of the Inn 
proposes a competition: whoever tells the best tale 
will be treated to dinner. If not for their pilgrimage, many of these figures would never 
have had the chance to interact. This is because Medieval society followed 
a feudal system that divided the clergy and nobility 
from the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a professional class of merchants 
and intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of his life 
as a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout Italy and France,
as well as his native England. This may have influenced
the panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales,
no level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses the quirks 
of the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The varied dialects, genres, 
and literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the different ways Medieval audiences 
entertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale 
of courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class narrators
are generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and slapstick. This variation 
includes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why readers
continue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation. While the narrative runs 
to over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue ambitiously 
introduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was
so caught up in his sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond 
of each character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader
is free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you.

**Transcript**:
When trains began to shuttle people 
across the coutryside, many insisted 
they would never replace horses. Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts 
insisted they wouldn’t catch on. Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves. Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before. The other half described those features 
in their present selves, and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change each participant reported or predicted. For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change 
came up short compared to the changes 
their older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected 
to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer 
had the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still 
have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds 
had lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole, they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us. One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician 
ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved
in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, 
there’s no real way to predict what our preferences 
will be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans. So the end of history illusion 
applies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? Could we be assuming that how things 
are now is how they will continue to be? If so, fortunately,
there are countless records to remind us that the world does change,
sometimes for the better. Our own historical moment 
isn’t the end of history, and that can be just as much a source

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 3, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 9
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When trains began to shuttle people 
across the coutryside, many insisted 
they would never replace horses. Less than a century later, people 
repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts 
insisted they wouldn’t catch on. Of course, we can’t predict exactly 
what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict 
that the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed 
a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change 
in ourselves. Three psychologists documented
our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper 
called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist 
Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy 
was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way 
we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. The researchers recruited over 
7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to
report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics 
had been ten years before. The other half described those features 
in their present selves, and predicted what 
they would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated 
the degree of change each participant reported or predicted. For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes 
to the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which 
18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds 
reported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change 
came up short compared to the changes 
their older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected 
to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer 
had the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still 
have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds 
had lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted 
they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less 
than younger people on the whole, they underestimated 
their capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life,
the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk 
of our personal change is behind us. One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest 
in future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing 
to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician 
ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their 
favorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved
in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible 
to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, 
there’s no real way to predict what our preferences 
will be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult 
to make any long-term plans. So the end of history illusion

under a descending pendulum blade, to a raven who refuses 
to leave the narrator’s chamber, Poe’s macabre and innovative stories 
of gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature. But just what is it that makes
Edgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors? After all, horror was a popular
genre of the period, with many practitioners. Yet Poe stood out thanks to his
careful attention to form and style. As a literary critic, he identified two cardinal rules 
for the short story form: it must be short enough 
to read in one sitting, and every word 
must contribute to its purpose. By mastering these rules, Poe commands the reader’s attention and rewards them with an intense 
and singular experience – what Poe called the unity of effect. Though often frightening,
this effect goes far beyond fear. Poe’s stories use violence and horror
to explore the paradoxes and mysteries of love, grief, and guilt, while resisting simple interpretations 
or clear moral messages. And while they often hint 
at supernatural elements, the true darkness they explore
is the human mind and its propensity for self-destruction. In “The Tell-Tale Heart,”
a ghastly murder is juxtaposed with the killer’s 
tender empathy towards the victim – a connection that soon 
returns to haunt him. The title character of "Ligeia"
returns from the dead through the corpse 
of her husband’s second wife – or at least the opium-addicted 
narrator thinks she does. And when the protagonist 
of “William Wilson” violently confronts a man 
he believes has been following him, he might just be staring 
at his own image in a mirror. Through his pioneering use 
of unreliable narrators, Poe turns readers into active participants who must decide when a storyteller
might be misinterpreting or even lying about the events 
they’re relating. Although he’s best known 
for his short horror stories, Poe was actually one of the most versatile and experimental writers 
of the nineteenth century. He invented the detective story 
as we know it, with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” followed by “The Mystery of Marie Roget” and “The Purloined Letter.” All three feature 
the original armchair detective, C. Auguste Dupin, who uses his genius and unusual powers 
of observation and deduction to solve crimes that baffle the police. Poe also wrote satires of social 
and literary trends, and hoaxes that in some cases 
anticipated science fiction. Those included an account of 
a balloon voyage to the moon, and a report of a dying patient 
put into a hypnotic trance so he could speak from the other side. Poe even wrote an adventure novel 
about a voyage to the South Pole and a treatise on astrophysics, all while he worked as an editor, producing hundreds of pages 
of book reviews and literary theory. An appreciation of Poe’s career 
wouldn’t be complete without his poetry: haunting and hypnotic. His best-known poems are songs of grief, 
or in his words, “mournful and never-ending remembrance.” “The Raven,” in which the speaker 
projects his grief onto a bird who merely repeats a single sound, made Poe famous. But despite his literary success, Poe lived in poverty 
throughout his career, and his personal life was often 
as dark as his writing. He was haunted by the loss of his mother 
and his wife, who both died of tuberculosis 
at the age of 24. Poe struggled with alcoholism and frequently antagonized 
other popular writers. Much of his fame came from posthumous –
and very loose – adaptations of his work. And yet, if he could’ve known 
how much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generations
of readers and writers alike, perhaps it may have brought 
a smile to that famously brooding visage.

at the age of 24. Poe struggled with alcoholism and frequently antagonized 
other popular writers. Much of his fame came from posthumous –
and very loose – adaptations of his work. And yet, if he could’ve known 
how much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generations
of readers and writers alike, perhaps it may have brought 
a smile to that famously brooding visage.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Human beings are everywhere. With settlements on every continent, we can be found in the most isolated 
corners of Earth’s jungles, oceans, and tundras. Our impact is so profound,
most scientists believe humanity has left a permanent mark 
on Earth’s geological record. So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared? With no one maintaining them, some
of our creations backfire immediately. Hours after we disappear,
oil refineries malfunction, producing month-long blazes at
plants like the ones in western India, the southern United States, and South Korea. In underground rail systems 
like those in London, Moscow, and New York City, hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,
flooding the tunnels in just three days. By the end of the first week,
most emergency generators have shut down, and once the fires have gone out, the earth goes dark 
for the first time in centuries. After the first catastrophic month,
changes come more gradually. Within 20 years, sidewalks have been 
torn apart by weeds and tree roots. Around this time, flooded tunnels erode 
the streets above into urban rivers. In temperate climates, the cycle of seasons freezes 
and thaws these waterways, cracking pavement 
and concrete foundations. Leaking pipes cause the same reaction 
in concrete buildings, and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers 
buckle and tumble down. In cities built in river deltas 
like Houston, these buildings 
eventually wash away completely - filling nearby tributaries 
with crushed concrete. Rural and suburban areas 
decay more slowly, but in largely unsurprising ways. Leaks, mold, bug 
and rodent infestations - all the usual enemies of the homeowner- now go uncontested. Within 75 years, most houses' 
supporting beams have rotted and sagged, and the resulting collapsed heap 
is now home to local rodents and lizards. But in this post-human world, 
“local” has a new meaning. Our cities are full of imported plants, which now run wild across 
their adopted homes. Water hyacinth coat the waterways 
of Shanghai in a thick green carpet. Poisonous giant hogweeds overgrow
the banks of London’s Thames River. Chinese Ailanthus trees burst
through New York City streets. And as sunken skyscrapers add
crumbled concrete to the new forest floor, the soil acidity plummets, potentially allowing 
new plant life to thrive. This post-human biodiversity 
extends into the animal kingdom, as well. Animals follow the unchecked 
spread of native and non-native plants, venturing into new habitats 
with the help of our leftover bridges. In general, our infrastructure 
saves some animals and dooms others. Cockroaches continue to thrive 
in their native tropical habitats, but without our heating systems, their urban cousins likely freeze
and die out in just two winters. And most domesticated animals 
are unable to survive without us – save for a handful of resourceful pigs, 
dogs, and feral housecats. Conversely, the reduced light pollution 
saves over a billion birds each year whose migrations were disrupted 
by blinking communication tower lights and high-tension wires. And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one
of their favorite manmade nurseries – rubber tires, which last 
for almost a thousand years. As fauna and flora flourish, Earth’s climate slowly recovers 
from millennia of human impact. Within 35,000 years, the plant cycle removes
the last traces of lead left by the Industrial Revolution 
from Earth’s soil, and it may take 
up to 65,000 years beyond that for CO2 to return pre-human levels. But even after several million years,
humanity’s legacy lives on. Carved in unyielding granite, America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years. The chemical composition 
of our bronze sculptures keeps them recognizable 
for over 10 million. And buried deep underground, the remnants of cities 
built on floodplains have been preserved in time 
as a kind of technofossil. Eventually, these traces, too, 
will be wiped from the planet’s surface. Humanity hasn’t always been here, 
and we won’t be here forever. But by investigating the world without us, perhaps we can learn more 
about the world we live in now.

Evaluation Prompt:

**Transcript**:
Human beings are everywhere. With settlements on every continent, we can be found in the most isolated 
corners of Earth’s jungles, oceans, and tundras. Our impact is so profound,
most scientists believe humanity has left a permanent mark 
on Earth’s geological record. So what would happen if suddenly, 
every human on Earth disappeared? With no one maintaining them, some
of our creations backfire immediately. Hours after we disappear,
oil refineries malfunction, producing month-long blazes at
plants like the ones in western India, the southern United States, and South Korea. In underground rail systems 
like those in London, Moscow, and New York City, hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,
flooding the tunnels in just three days. By the end of the first week,
most emergency generators have shut down, and once the fires have gone out, the earth goes dark 
for the first time in centuries. After the first catastrophic month,
changes come more gradually. Within 20 years, sidewalks have been 
torn apart by weeds and tree roots. Around this time, flooded tunnels erode 
the streets above into urban rivers. In temperate climates, the cycle of seasons freezes 
and thaws these waterways, cracking pavement 
and concrete foundations. Leaking pipes cause the same reaction 
in concrete buildings, and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers 
buckle and tumble down. In cities built in river deltas 
like Houston, these buildings 
eventually wash away completely - filling nearby tributaries 
with crushed concrete. Rural and suburban areas 
decay more slowly, but in largely unsurprising ways. Leaks, mold, bug 
and rodent infestations - all the usual enemies of the homeowner- now go uncontested. Within 75 years, most houses' 
supporting beams have rotted and sagged, and the resulting collapsed heap 
is now home to local rodents and lizards. But in this post-human world, 
“local” has a new meaning. Our cities are full of imported plants, which now run wild across 
their adopted homes. Water hyacinth coat the waterways 
of Shanghai in a thick green carpet. Poisonous giant hogweeds overgrow
the banks of London’s Thames River. Chinese Ailanthus trees burst
through New York City streets. And as sunken skyscrapers add
crumbled concrete to the new forest floor, the soil acidity plummets, potentially allowing 
new plant life to thrive. This post-human biodiversity 
extends into the animal kingdom, as well. Animals follow the unchecked 
spread of native and non-native plants, venturing into new habitats 
with the help of our leftover bridges. In general, our infrastructure 
saves some animals and dooms others. Cockroaches continue to thrive 
in their native tropical habitats, but without our heating systems, their urban cousins likely freeze
and die out in just two winters. And most domesticated animals 
are unable to survive without us – save for a handful of resourceful pigs, 
dogs, and feral housecats. Conversely, the reduced light pollution 
saves over a billion birds each year whose migrations were disrupted 
by blinking communication tower lights and high-tension wires. And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one
of their favorite manmade nurseries – rubber tires, which last 
for almost a thousand years. As fauna and flora flourish, Earth’s climate slowly recovers 
from millennia of human impact. Within 35,000 years, the plant cycle removes
the last traces of lead left by the Industrial Revolution 
from Earth’s soil, and it may take 
up to 65,000 years beyond that for CO2 to return pre-human levels. But even after several million years,
humanity’s legacy lives on. Carved in unyielding granite, America’s Mt. Rushmore 
survives for 7.2 million years. The chemical composition 
of our bronze sculptures keeps them recognizable 
for over 10 million. And buried deep underground, the remnants of cities 
built on floodplains have been preserved in time 
as a kind of technofossil. Eventually, these traces, too, 
will be wiped from the planet’s surface. Humanity hasn’t always been here, 
and we won’t be here forever. But by investigating the world without us, perhaps we can learn more 
about the world we live in now.

**Transcript**:
Cigarettes aren’t good for us. That’s hardly news--we’ve known 
about the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens 
as their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically 
when we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, 
a black, resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, 
and eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages 
nerve-endings in the nose, causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases 
the likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases
like bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is 
to keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide 
crosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported
around the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant 
called nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine 
and other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations 
which make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals 
from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction 
of blood vessels and damage their delicate 
endothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet stickiness, increasing the likelihood 
that clots will form and trigger heart attacks and strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes 
can trigger dangerous mutations in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic 
and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability 
to fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three 
cancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer. Smoking can cause cancer 
in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder 
for women to get pregnant. And in men,
it can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside with almost immediate 
and long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after 
a smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure
begin to return to normal. After 12 hours, 
carbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s 
oxygen-carrying capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as
blood pressure and heart rates normalize. After two days, the nerve endings responsible 
for smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier 
after about one month, with less coughing 
and shortness of breath. The delicate hair-like cilia 
in the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are restored after 9 months, 
improving resistance to infection. By the one-year anniversary of quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half
as blood vessel function improves. Five years in, the chance of a clot forming
dramatically declines, and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce. After ten years, the chances 
of developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50%, probably because the body’s ability 
to repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen years in, the likelihood 
of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same 
as that of a non-smoker. There’s no point pretending 
this is all easy to achieve. Quitting can lead to anxiety 
and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately, 
such effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier,
thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin patches, lozenges, and sprays may help wean smokers off cigarettes. They work by stimulating 
nicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms, without the addition 
of other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarette-free. That’s good news, since quitting puts you and your body 
on the path back to health.

about the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens 
as their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically 
when we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 
chemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, 
a black, resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, 
and eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages 
nerve-endings in the nose, causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases 
the likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases
like bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is 
to keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange 
of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide 
crosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported
around the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking 
can lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant 
called nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine 
and other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations 
which make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals 
from the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction 
of blood vessels and damage their delicate 
endothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These vascular effects lead 
to thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet stickiness, increasing the likelihood 
that clots will form and trigger heart attacks and strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes 
can trigger dangerous mutations in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic 
and nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability 
to fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three 
cancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer. Smoking can cause cancer 
in multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder 
for women to get pregnant. And in men,
it can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside with almost immediate 
and long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after 
a smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure
begin to return to normal. After 12 hours, 
carbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s 
oxygen-carrying capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as
blood pressure and heart rates normalize. After two days, the nerve endings responsible 
for smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier 
after about one month, with less coughing 
and shortness of breath. The delicate hair-like cilia 
in the airways and lungs start recovering within weeks, and are restored after 9 months, 
improving resistance to infection. By the one-year anniversary of quitting, heart disease risk plummets to half
as blood vessel function improves. Five years in, the chance of a clot forming
dramatically declines, and the risk of stroke 
continues to reduce. After ten years, the chances 
of developing fatal lung cancer go down by 50%, probably because the body’s ability 
to repair DNA is once again restored. Fifteen years in, the likelihood 
of developing coronary heart disease is essentially the same 
as that of a non-smoker. There’s no point pretending 
this is all easy to achieve. Quitting can lead to anxiety 
and depression, resulting from nicotine withdrawal. But fortunately, 
such effects are usually temporary. And quitting is getting easier,
thanks to a growing arsenal of tools. Nicotine replacement therapy through gum, skin patches, lozenges, and sprays may help wean smokers off cigarettes. They work by stimulating 
nicotine receptors in the brain and thus preventing withdrawal symptoms, without the addition 
of other harmful chemicals. Counselling and support groups, cognitive behavioral therapy, and moderate intensity exercise also help smokers stay cigarette-free. That’s good news, since quitting puts you and your body 
on the path back to health.

**Transcript**:
In the year 1066, 7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed 
in warships across the English Channel. Their target: England, 
home to more than a million people. Theirs was a short voyage
with massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans
were setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate
throughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave 
their mark so far and wide? Our story begins 
over 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle 
on the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus 
across northern Europe. The French locals called 
these invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles, 
the king of the Franks, negotiated peace with 
the Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land 
along France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable
to their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting 
from Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit 
of their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights 
were looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement 
was their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of 
the new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army 
near the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in 
the 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold 
in the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains 
with a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname 
"William the Conqueror" through a massive survey
known as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population
and ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language 
of the new royal court, while commoners continued 
to speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged 
to give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords 
and peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded 
into Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Meanwhile, independent groups 
of Norman knights traveled to the Mediterranean, inspired by tales of pilgrims 
returning from Jerusalem. There, they threw themselves 
into a tangled mass of conflicts among the established powers 
all over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded 
heavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became 
standard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central 
to the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established
Christian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm 
and Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them
to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of
multicultural tolerance in a world torn apart 
by religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars 
served in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors 
and architects. Arabic remained an official language along
with Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge 
was compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate 
available for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo
combined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with
exquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful,
why aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of
their success: not just ruling the societies 
they conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually 
disappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and
cathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape to wherever 
the English language is spoken, the Norman legacy lives on.

all over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded 
heavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became 
standard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central 
to the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established
Christian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm 
and Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them
to form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of
multicultural tolerance in a world torn apart 
by religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars 
served in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors 
and architects. Arabic remained an official language along
with Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge 
was compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate 
available for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo
combined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with
exquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful,
why aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of

they conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually 
disappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and

**Transcript**:
In the year 1066, 7000 Norman infantry and knights sailed 
in warships across the English Channel. Their target: England, 
home to more than a million people. Theirs was a short voyage
with massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans
were setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate
throughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave 
their mark so far and wide? Our story begins 
over 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle 
on the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus 
across northern Europe. The French locals called 
these invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles, 
the king of the Franks, negotiated peace with 
the Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land 
along France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable
to their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting 
from Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit 
of their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights 
were looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement 
was their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of 
the new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army 
near the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in 
the 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold 
in the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains 
with a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname 
"William the Conqueror" through a massive survey
known as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population
and ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language 
of the new royal court, while commoners continued 
to speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged 
to give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords 
and peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded

**Transcript**:
Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, 
who’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking 
at someone who’s not married? Take a moment to think about it. Most people answer that there’s 
not enough information to tell. And most people are wrong. Linda must be either married 
or not married—there are no other options. So in either scenario, someone married 
is looking at someone who’s not married. When presented with the explanation, 
most people change their minds and accept the correct answer, despite being very confident 
in their first responses. Now let’s look at another case. A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan 
and Jason Reifler examined American attitudes regarding 
the justifications for the Iraq War. Researchers presented participants 
with a news article that showed no weapons 
of mass destruction had been found. Yet many participants not only continued 
to believe that WMDs had been found, but they even became more convinced 
of their original views. So why do arguments change people’s minds 
in some cases and backfire in others? Arguments are more convincing when they 
rest on a good knowledge of the audience, taking into account 
what the audience believes, who they trust, and what they value. Mathematical and logical arguments 
like the dinner party brainteaser work because even when people 
reach different conclusions, they’re starting from 
the same set of shared beliefs. In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician 
named Kurt Gödel presented a proof that a logically complete
system of mathematics was impossible. Despite upending decades of
work by brilliant mathematicians like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert, the proof was accepted because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on. Of course, many disagreements involve 
different beliefs that can’t simply be reconciled
through logic. When these beliefs involve 
outside information, the issue often comes down to
what sources and authorities people trust. One study asked people to estimate 
several statistics related to the scope of climate change. Participants were asked questions, such as “how many of the years 
between 1995 and 2006 were one of the hottest 12 years 
since 1850?” After providing their answers, they were presented with data from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in this case showing that the answer 
was 11 of the 12 years. Being provided with these reliable 
statistics from a trusted official source made people more likely to accept 
the reality that the earth is warming. Finally, for disagreements that 
can’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making a convincing argument may depend on engaging 
the audience’s values. For example, researchers have conducted 
a number of studies where they’ve asked people 
of different political backgrounds to rank their values. Liberals in these studies, 
on average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is treated 
in the same way—above loyalty. In later studies, researchers attempted 
to convince liberals to support military spending with 
a variety of arguments. Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty— such as that the military 
unifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus. The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best way to find out
is simply to talk to them. In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments
and rebuttals. These can help you make your own 
arguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes, you may even end up 
being the one changing your mind.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, 
who’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking 
at someone who’s not married? Take a moment to think about it. Most people answer that there’s 
not enough information to tell. And most people are wrong. Linda must be either married 
or not married—there are no other options. So in either scenario, someone married 
is looking at someone who’s not married. When presented with the explanation, 
most people change their minds and accept the correct answer, despite being very confident 
in their first responses. Now let’s look at another case. A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan 
and Jason Reifler examined American attitudes regarding 
the justifications for the Iraq War. Researchers presented participants 
with a news article that showed no weapons 
of mass destruction had been found. Yet many participants not only continued 
to believe that WMDs had been found, but they even became more convinced 
of their original views. So why do arguments change people’s minds 
in some cases and backfire in others? Arguments are more convincing when they 
rest on a good knowledge of the audience, taking into account 
what the audience believes, who they trust, and what they value. Mathematical and logical arguments 
like the dinner party brainteaser work because even when people 
reach different conclusions, they’re starting from 
the same set of shared beliefs. In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician 
named Kurt Gödel presented a proof that a logically complete
system of mathematics was impossible. Despite upending decades of
work by brilliant mathematicians like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert, the proof was accepted because it relied on axioms that 
everyone in the field already agreed on. Of course, many disagreements involve 
different beliefs that can’t simply be reconciled
through logic. When these beliefs involve 
outside information, the issue often comes down to
what sources and authorities people trust. One study asked people to estimate 
several statistics related to the scope of climate change. Participants were asked questions, such as “how many of the years 
between 1995 and 2006 were one of the hottest 12 years 
since 1850?” After providing their answers, they were presented with data from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in this case showing that the answer 
was 11 of the 12 years. Being provided with these reliable 
statistics from a trusted official source made people more likely to accept 
the reality that the earth is warming. Finally, for disagreements that 
can’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making a convincing argument may depend on engaging 
the audience’s values. For example, researchers have conducted 
a number of studies where they’ve asked people 
of different political backgrounds to rank their values. Liberals in these studies, 
on average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is treated 
in the same way—above loyalty. In later studies, researchers attempted 
to convince liberals to support military spending with 
a variety of arguments. Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people 
from disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments 
based on loyalty— such as that the military 
unifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula 
for finding agreement and consensus. The problem is that our initial 
inclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, 
trusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly 
identify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best way to find out
is simply to talk to them. In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments
and rebuttals. These can help you make your own 
arguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes, you may even end up 
being the one changing your mind.

**Transcript**:
It’s another sweltering morning 
in Memphis, Egypt. As the sunlight brightens the Nile, 
Peseshet checks her supplies. Honey, garlic, cumin, acacia leaves, cedar oil. She’s well stocked with the essentials 
she needs to treat her patients. Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor. In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored 
at the Per Ankh, the House of Life. Now, she teaches her own students there. Before teaching, 
Peseshet has a patient to see. One of the workers at the temple 
construction site has injured his arm. When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, 
with multiple bone fragments. Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury. Her next stop is the House of Life. On her way, a woman intercepts 
Peseshet in the street. The woman’s son 
has been stung by a scorpion. Peseshet has seen many similar stings 
and knows exactly what to do. She must say an incantation 
to cast the poison out. She begins to recite the spell, invoking Serqet, patron of physicians 
and goddess of venomous creatures. Peseshet recites the spell 
as if she is Serqet. This commanding approach 
has the greatest chance at success. After she utters the last line, she tries to cut the poison out 
with a knife for good measure. Peseshet packs up to leave,
but the woman has another question. She wants to find out if she is pregnant. Peseshet explains 
her fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer. Then, urinate on the seeds every day. If the plants grow, she’s pregnant. A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl. Peseshet also recommends a prayer
to Hathor, goddess of fertility. When Peseshet finally arrives 
at the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi. She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks
priests are very full of themselves. She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role 
as neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman 
of the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus. Inside, the House of Life is bustling 
as usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students. Papyri containing all kinds of records, 
not just medical information, are stored here. Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard 
at work copying documents as part of his training 
to become a scribe. He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study 
because Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, 
and impossible for girls, to pursue this education. Peseshet oversees all the female 
swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis. The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors 
won’t answer to a woman. Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy. She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits. Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her 
at the door and begs to be examined. The woman has a huge, 
sore lump under her arm. Peseshet probes the growth 
and finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit. She has read about ailments 
like this, but never seen one. For this tumor there is no treatment, 
medicine or spell. All the texts give the same advice: 
do nothing. After delivering the bad news, 
Peseshet goes outside. She lingers on the steps
of the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk. In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients 
she can’t help, like the woman with the tumor. They linger with her,
but Peseshet has no time to dwell. In a few short weeks, the Nile’s annual flooding will begin, bringing life to the soil for 
the next year’s harvest and a whole new crop of patients.

**Transcript**:
It’s another sweltering morning 
in Memphis, Egypt. As the sunlight brightens the Nile, 
Peseshet checks her supplies. Honey, garlic, cumin, acacia leaves, cedar oil. She’s well stocked with the essentials 
she needs to treat her patients. Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor. In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored 
at the Per Ankh, the House of Life. Now, she teaches her own students there. Before teaching, 
Peseshet has a patient to see. One of the workers at the temple 
construction site has injured his arm. When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, 
with multiple bone fragments. Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury. Her next stop is the House of Life. On her way, a woman intercepts 
Peseshet in the street. The woman’s son 
has been stung by a scorpion. Peseshet has seen many similar stings 
and knows exactly what to do. She must say an incantation 
to cast the poison out. She begins to recite the spell, invoking Serqet, patron of physicians 
and goddess of venomous creatures. Peseshet recites the spell 
as if she is Serqet. This commanding approach 
has the greatest chance at success. After she utters the last line, she tries to cut the poison out 
with a knife for good measure. Peseshet packs up to leave,
but the woman has another question. She wants to find out if she is pregnant. Peseshet explains 
her fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer. Then, urinate on the seeds every day. If the plants grow, she’s pregnant. A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl. Peseshet also recommends a prayer
to Hathor, goddess of fertility. When Peseshet finally arrives 
at the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi. She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks
priests are very full of themselves. She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role 
as neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman 
of the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus. Inside, the House of Life is bustling 
as usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students. Papyri containing all kinds of records, 
not just medical information, are stored here. Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard 
at work copying documents as part of his training 
to become a scribe. He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study 
because Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, 
and impossible for girls, to pursue this education. Peseshet oversees all the female 
swnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis. The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors 
won’t answer to a woman. Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy. She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits. Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her 
at the door and begs to be examined. The woman has a huge, 
sore lump under her arm. Peseshet probes the growth 
and finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit. She has read about ailments 
like this, but never seen one. For this tumor there is no treatment, 
medicine or spell. All the texts give the same advice: 
do nothing. After delivering the bad news, 
Peseshet goes outside. She lingers on the steps
of the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk. In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients 
she can’t help, like the woman with the tumor. They linger with her,
but Peseshet has no time to dwell. In a few short weeks, the Nile’s annual flooding will begin, bringing life to the soil for 
the next year’s harvest and a whole new crop of patients.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine trying to use words 
to describe every scene in a film, every note in your favorite song, or every street in your town. Now imagine trying to do it using 
only the numbers 1 and 0. Every time you use the Internet
to watch a movie, listen to music, or check directions, that’s exactly what your device is doing, using the language of binary code. Computers use binary because 
it's a reliable way of storing data. For example, a computer's main
memory is made of transistors that switch between either high 
or low voltage levels, such as 5 volts and 0 volts. Voltages sometimes oscillate,
but since there are only two options, a value of 1 volt 
would still be read as "low." That reading is done by 
the computer’s processor, which uses the transistors’ states 
to control other computer devices according to software instructions. The genius of this system 
is that a given binary sequence doesn't have a pre-determined meaning 
on its own. Instead, each type of data
is encoded in binary according to a separate 
set of rules. Let’s take numbers. In normal decimal notation,  each digit is multiplied by 10 raised 
to the value of its position, starting from zero on the right. So 84 in decimal form is 4x10⁰ + 8x10¹. Binary number notation works similarly, but with each position 
based on 2 raised to some power. So 84 would be written as follows: Meanwhile, letters are interpreted 
based on standard rules like UTF-8, which assigns each character to a specific
group of 8-digit binary strings. In this case, 01010100 corresponds 
to the letter T. So, how can you know whether 
a given instance of this sequence is supposed to mean T or 84? Well, you can’t from seeing 
the string alone – just as you can’t tell what the sound
"da" means from hearing it in isolation. You need context to tell whether you're
hearing Russian, Spanish, or English. And you need similar context to tell whether you’re looking 
at binary numbers or binary text. Binary code is also used for 
far more complex types of data. Each frame of this video, for instance, is made of hundreds 
of thousands of pixels. In color images, every pixel is represented 
by three binary sequences that correspond to the primary colors. Each sequence encodes a number that determines
the intensity of that particular color. Then, a video driver program transmits 
this information to the millions of liquid crystals 
in your screen to make all the different hues 
you see now. The sound in this video 
is also stored in binary, with the help of a technique 
called pulse code modulation. Continuous sound waves are digitized by taking "snapshots" of their 
amplitudes every few milliseconds. These are recorded as numbers 
in the form of binary strings, with as many as 44,000
for every second of sound. When they’re read by 
your computer’s audio software, the numbers determine how quickly 
the coils in your speakers should vibrate to create sounds of different frequencies. All of this requires billions 
and billions of bits. But that amount can be reduced 
through clever compression formats. For example, if a picture has 30 adjacent 
pixels of green space, they can be recorded as "30 green" instead
of coding each pixel separately - a process known as run-length encoding. These compressed formats are themselves 
written in binary code. So is binary the end-all-be-all 
of computing? Not necessarily. There’s been research 
into ternary computers, with circuits in three possible states, and even quantum computers, whose circuits can be
in multiple states simultaneously. But so far, none of these has provided as much physical stability 
for data storage and transmission. So for now, everything you see, hear, and read through your screen comes to you as the result 
of a simple "true" or "false" choice, made billions of times over.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 6
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine trying to use words 
to describe every scene in a film, every note in your favorite song, or every street in your town. Now imagine trying to do it using 
only the numbers 1 and 0. Every time you use the Internet
to watch a movie, listen to music, or check directions, that’s exactly what your device is doing, using the language of binary code. Computers use binary because 
it's a reliable way of storing data. For example, a computer's main
memory is made of transistors that switch between either high 
or low voltage levels, such as 5 volts and 0 volts. Voltages sometimes oscillate,
but since there are only two options, a value of 1 volt 
would still be read as "low." That reading is done by 
the computer’s processor, which uses the transistors’ states 
to control other computer devices according to software instructions. The genius of this system 
is that a given binary sequence doesn't have a pre-determined meaning 
on its own. Instead, each type of data
is encoded in binary according to a separate 
set of rules. Let’s take numbers. In normal decimal notation,  each digit is multiplied by 10 raised 
to the value of its position, starting from zero on the right. So 84 in decimal form is 4x10⁰ + 8x10¹. Binary number notation works similarly, but with each position 
based on 2 raised to some power. So 84 would be written as follows: Meanwhile, letters are interpreted 
based on standard rules like UTF-8, which assigns each character to a specific
group of 8-digit binary strings. In this case, 01010100 corresponds 
to the letter T. So, how can you know whether 
a given instance of this sequence is supposed to mean T or 84? Well, you can’t from seeing 
the string alone – just as you can’t tell what the sound
"da" means from hearing it in isolation. You need context to tell whether you're
hearing Russian, Spanish, or English. And you need similar context to tell whether you’re looking 
at binary numbers or binary text. Binary code is also used for 
far more complex types of data. Each frame of this video, for instance, is made of hundreds

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How can one compress a picture encoded in binary into a smaller file without loss of information?
Options: A. Half of the information stored in binary is not actually needed to store it, so it can simply be suppressed, B. We can store more data in smaller devices because of the recent advances in technology that follow Moore's law, C. When you compress a picture, you are actually creating a shortcut to some region of the main memory; since the shortcut takes less memory than the file, we have the impression it is compressed, D. Pictures usually have pixels that are very similar to their surrounding pixels; instead of storing every single one of them, the compressor software can store only the first one, as well as the number of times it must be repeated
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the purpose of run-length encoding in relation to image compression?
Options: A. To record each pixel separately., B. To record adjacent pixels of the same color as a single unit., C. To record adjacent pixels of different colors as a single unit., D. To record each pixel as a combination of primary colors.
Correct Option: B

**Transcript**:
The coldest materials in the world 
aren’t in Antarctica. They’re not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier. They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions
of a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder 
than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder 
than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder
than outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a
window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build 
incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in 
the farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such 
extreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down 
moving particles. When we’re talking about temperature,
what we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly,
we perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more
slowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object 
or gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment, 
like a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot
object is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm
to create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam 
heats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall 
moving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device 
called a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field 
draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed 
at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb
a photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from
the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams, 
in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling 
in all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly, 
as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it 
described as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down 
to just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists 
who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997
for the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been 
improved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want 
to cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make
very good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive 
to fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find 
underground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make 
highly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used 
in global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold 
enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity 
makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves 
in future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly 
tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out 
at normal temperatures, when atoms speed around 
at hundreds of meters per second. Laser cooling can slow atoms to just 
a few centimeters per second— enough for the motion caused by
atomic quantum effects to become obvious. Ultracold atoms have already 
allowed scientists to study phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, in which atoms are cooled almost 
to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter. So as researchers continue in their quest 
to understand the laws of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe, they’ll do so with the help 
of the very coldest atoms in it.

**Transcript**:
The coldest materials in the world 
aren’t in Antarctica. They’re not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier. They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions
of a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder 
than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder 
than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder
than outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a
window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build 
incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in 
the farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such 
extreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down 
moving particles. When we’re talking about temperature,
what we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly,
we perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more
slowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object 
or gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment, 
like a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot
object is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm
to create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way 
to slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam 
heats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall 
moving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device 
called a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field 
draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed 
at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb
a photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from
the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams, 
in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling 
in all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly, 
as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it 
described as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down 
to just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists 
who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997
for the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been 
improved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want 
to cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make
very good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive 
to fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find 
underground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make 
highly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used 
in global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold 
enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity 
makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves 
in future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study 
of atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly 
tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out 
at normal temperatures, when atoms speed around 
at hundreds of meters per second. Laser cooling can slow atoms to just 
a few centimeters per second— enough for the motion caused by
atomic quantum effects to become obvious. Ultracold atoms have already 
allowed scientists to study phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, in which atoms are cooled almost 
to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter. So as researchers continue in their quest 
to understand the laws of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe, they’ll do so with the help 
of the very coldest atoms in it.

**Transcript**:
Imagine being strapped into a big chunk
of metal raised over a hundred twenty meters into the sky and then dropped
whizzing over hills and even looping upside down. When you put it that way roller coasters can seem a little
terrifying but they're also exhilarating and involve some really interesting
physics make all those speedy gut dropping thrills work. Most roller
coasters start off with something called a lift hill, which mechanically lifts you to
the top of the first and tallest hill. But other roller coasters start a little
more suddenly. They're rapidly propelled forward thanks the hydraulics - the branch
of physics that deals with fluids and how different mechanical forces affect
them. Hydraulic launch systems work by using a cable that's attached to two
important pieces: a catch-car which connects to the bottom of
the roller coaster train and a giant winch which is basically a huge spool
that winds the cable when it's turned by some motor. So, to launch the train this
cable pulls it down the tracks like reeling in a fish really fast. After a
few seconds the Catch-car releases the train so it can zoom up the big hill. It's
kind of a complex mechanism but we'll go over the basics. The hydraulic fluid and some
nitrogen gas are separated by a piston inside this chamber called the hydraulic
accumulator. And the key to these launch systems is the fact that liquids, like
hydraulic fluid, are incompressible. So the hydraulic fluid is pumped into the
accumulator and compresses the nitrogen gas so there's more gas molecules
bouncing around in a smaller space, which increases the pressure. Nitrogen gas is
cheap, easy to get, and won't react dangerously to heat and high pressure.
Basically no huge explosions. And once the pressure is high enough, a valve is
opened and the hydraulic fluid rushes out to power a bunch of motors, which
turn the winch, which pulls the cable and accelerates the train. Just like that,
within a couple seconds you're speeding along at hundreds of kilometers per hour.
So now that the ride started you've made it to the top of the first hill and you
start to head over the other side you might feel something weird. Like besides
the adrenaline or other chemicals that give you that exciting rush. There's that
sinking feeling in your stomach and you might feel weightless. That's because
you're in freefall - meaning that gravity is the only force acting on your body.
Normally throughout the day you're able to feel your weight because something
like the ground or a chair is pushing back on your body from your feet to your
bones and organs. But when you're in freefall you're not being supported by
anything, so there isn't a force pushing upward on you. You're just accelerating toward
the earth at 9.8 meters per second squared like any other falling object.
Now all good or slightly terrifying things have to come to an end so the
roller coaster train needs to stop somehow. Traditionally roller coasters
use breaks that coming contact with a speeding train like
something that skids along the bottom or clamps that close round metal fins on
the cars. These breaks rely on friction which causes the kinetic energy, the
energy of motion, to be converted into heat energy and stops the train. And
these brakes work but they get worn out from all this contact. But there are some
breaks that don't involve friction. They work by moving a conductor like the
metal pins sticking out from the train through a magnetic field. A magnetic
field can be produced by electric currents, like the currents running
through a wire or the microscopic currents formed by electrons moving
within atoms, which is kinda helped permanent magnets work. So on the tracks
of some roller coasters there are rows of permanent magnets that create a
magnetic field. And when the metal fins pass through the magnetic field it
induces a ring-like current called an eddy current. This has to do with Lenz's
law which essentially tells us that conductors like these metal fins don't
like change. So when the fins enter a magnetic field that wasn't there before,
they'll create a current that makes its own magnetic field that opposes this
change. The train will slow down because the kinetic energy of the moving train
is dissipated as heat by the eddy currents flowing through the metal. And
eventually the train comes to a stop all without friction. So whether you love 'em
or hate 'em, hopefully knowing some of the physics behind roller coasters can
make you appreciate them a little more. Thank you for watching this episode of

**Transcript**:
The 40 or so muscles in the human face 
can be activated in different combinations to create thousands of expressions. But do these expressions look the same and communicate the same
meaning around the world, regardless of culture? Is one person’s smile another’s grimace? Charles Darwin theorized that emotional 
expression was a common human feature. But he was in the minority. Until the mid-20th century, many researchers believed 
that the specific ways we show emotion were learned behaviors 
that varied across cultures. Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins 
was one of the few to insist otherwise. Tomkins claimed that certain affects— emotional states and their associated 
facial expressions— were universal. In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman 
set about testing this theory by examining hundreds 
of hours of film footage of remote tribes isolated 
from the modern world. Ekman found the native peoples’ 
expressions to be not only familiar, but occurring in precisely 
the situations he would expect. Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who
had no prior exposure to Western culture. They were able to correctly match photos
of different facial expressions with stories designed 
to trigger particular feelings. Over the next few decades, further research has
corroborated Darwin’s idea that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal. The degrees of expression appropriate 
to a given situation can, however, vary greatly across cultures. For instance, researchers 
have studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that 
if expressions are universal, they would be displayed 
in the same way as sighted people. In one study, both blind 
and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion
when winning or losing their matches. Further evidence can be found 
in our evolutionary relatives. Comparisons of facial expression
between humans and non-human mammals have found similarities in the structure 
and movement of facial muscles. Chimpanzee laughter 
looks different from ours, but uses some of the same 
muscle movements. Back in the 60s, Ekman identified 
six core expressions. Anger is accompanied by lowered
eyebrows drawn together, tense and narrowed eyes, and tight lips; disgust, by the lips pulled up
and the nose crinkling. In fear, the upper white of the eyes 
are revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows 
and relaxed lips. Sadness is indicated by the inner corners 
of the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards, drooping eyes, and a downturned mouth. And of course there’s happiness: lips drawn up and back, and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes. More recently, researchers 
have proposed additional entries such as contempt, shame, and disapproval, but opinions vary 
on how distinct boundaries between these categories can be drawn. So if Ekman and other researchers 
are correct, what makes certain expressions universal? And why are they expressed 
in these particular ways? Scientists have a lot of theories rooted 
in our evolutionary history. One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival. Fear and surprise could signal 
to others an immediate danger. Studies of humans and some other primates have found that we pay more attention 
to faces that signal threats over neutral faces, particularly when we’re already 
on high alert. Expressions also could 
help improve group fitness by communicating our internal states 
to those around us. Sadness, for example, signals to the group
that something’s wrong. There’s some evidence that expressions might be even more directly linked 
to our physiology. The fear expression, for instance, could directly improve survival 
in potentially dangerous situations by letting our eyes absorb more light and our lungs take in more air, 
preparing us to fight or flee. There’s still much research to be done 
in understanding emotional expression, particularly as we learn more about 
the inner workings of the brain. But if you ever find yourself 
among strangers in a strange land, a friendly smile could go a long way.

have studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that 
if expressions are universal, they would be displayed 
in the same way as sighted people. In one study, both blind 
and sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion
when winning or losing their matches. Further evidence can be found 
in our evolutionary relatives. Comparisons of facial expression
between humans and non-human mammals have found similarities in the structure 
and movement of facial muscles. Chimpanzee laughter 
looks different from ours, but uses some of the same 
muscle movements. Back in the 60s, Ekman identified 
six core expressions. Anger is accompanied by lowered
eyebrows drawn together, tense and narrowed eyes, and tight lips; disgust, by the lips pulled up
and the nose crinkling. In fear, the upper white of the eyes 
are revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows 
and relaxed lips. Sadness is indicated by the inner corners 
of the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards, drooping eyes, and a downturned mouth. And of course there’s happiness: lips drawn up and back, and raised cheeks causing wrinkling 
around the eyes. More recently, researchers 
have proposed additional entries such as contempt, shame, and disapproval, but opinions vary 
on how distinct boundaries between these categories can be drawn. So if Ekman and other researchers 
are correct, what makes certain expressions universal? And why are they expressed 
in these particular ways? Scientists have a lot of theories rooted 
in our evolutionary history. One is that certain expressions 
are important for survival. Fear and surprise could signal 
to others an immediate danger. Studies of humans and some other primates have found that we pay more attention 
to faces that signal threats over neutral faces, particularly when we’re already 
on high alert. Expressions also could 
help improve group fitness by communicating our internal states 
to those around us. Sadness, for example, signals to the group
that something’s wrong. There’s some evidence that expressions might be even more directly linked 
to our physiology. The fear expression, for instance, could directly improve survival 
in potentially dangerous situations by letting our eyes absorb more light and our lungs take in more air, 
preparing us to fight or flee. There’s still much research to be done 
in understanding emotional expression, particularly as we learn more about 
the inner workings of the brain. But if you ever find yourself 
among strangers in a strange land, a friendly smile could go a long way.

**Transcript**:
The 40 or so muscles in the human face 
can be activated in different combinations to create thousands of expressions. But do these expressions look the same and communicate the same
meaning around the world, regardless of culture? Is one person’s smile another’s grimace? Charles Darwin theorized that emotional 
expression was a common human feature. But he was in the minority. Until the mid-20th century, many researchers believed 
that the specific ways we show emotion were learned behaviors 
that varied across cultures. Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins 
was one of the few to insist otherwise. Tomkins claimed that certain affects— emotional states and their associated 
facial expressions— were universal. In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman 
set about testing this theory by examining hundreds 
of hours of film footage of remote tribes isolated 
from the modern world. Ekman found the native peoples’ 
expressions to be not only familiar, but occurring in precisely 
the situations he would expect. Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who
had no prior exposure to Western culture. They were able to correctly match photos
of different facial expressions with stories designed 
to trigger particular feelings. Over the next few decades, further research has
corroborated Darwin’s idea that some of our most important emotional
expressions are in fact universal. The degrees of expression appropriate 
to a given situation can, however, vary greatly across cultures. For instance, researchers 
have studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that

**Transcript**:
Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything 
from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies 
on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body 
for menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around 
the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male 
and female hormones. In fact, men and women 
have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role 
in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals 
in the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones 
have unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function 
of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most 
common hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas 
secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much 
thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep 
our bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything 
from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies 
on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body 
for menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around 
the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male 
and female hormones. In fact, men and women 
have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role 
in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals 
in the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones 
have unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function 
of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most 
common hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas 
secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much 
thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep 
our bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.

**Transcript**:
Over the course of our lifetimes, our bodies undergo a series 
of extraordinary metamorphoses: we grow, experience puberty, and many of us reproduce. Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works 
constantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything 
from your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each 
and every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies 
on interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by 
a network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients 
to manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs 
to locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, 
it’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside 
or on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination 
triggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease 
specific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives 
large-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid 
and the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most 
of the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly 
those cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything 
from breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when 
the testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development 
of the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body 
for menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around 
the endocrine system is that there are exclusively male 
and female hormones. In fact, men and women 
have estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role 
in pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals 
in the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones 
have unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main 
drivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior 
is collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain 
and its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function 
of the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, 
not control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt 
that regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones 
that glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most 
common hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas 
secretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much 
thyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep 
our bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1960,
Frances Oldham Kelsey was one of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s newest recruits. Before the year was out, she would begin a fight that would 
save thousands of lives, though no one knew it at the time. Although she was new to the FDA,
Kelsey was no novice as a scientist. After graduating 
from high school at age 15, she enrolled 
at McGill University in Montreal and earned both undergraduate 
and master’s degrees in pharmacology. From there, she applied
for a research post at the University of Chicago’s
pharmacology department. Her acceptance letter was addressed 
to Mr. Oldham. Kelsey later joked that had her name 
been Elizabeth or Mary Jane, her career might have ended there. Fortunately, it didn’t. She earned her doctorate
in pharmacology and accepted Chicago’s invitation 
to stay as faculty, where she undertook pioneering
research on drugs and fetal safety. In 1950, she earned an MD, 
her fourth and final degree. By the time she joined the FDA, Frances Kelsey was one of the most
educated, experienced scientists around. Yet, as the newest member
of the team, Kelsey was assigned what everyone 
thought would be an easy review: an application from the
US drug company Merrell to sell a drug called thalidomide. Thalidomide was a sedative 
developed in Germany that was already being widely used 
in dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress. Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties also made it a popular remedy for pregnant
women with morning sickness. Reviewing Merrell’s application, Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s
absorption and toxicity inadequate. Today, the FDA classifies drugs based 
on their safety for a fetus. But in 1960, many experts believed 
that the placental barrier shielded a fetus from harm. Kelsey's earlier animal-based research demonstrated the opposite: drugs could pass from mother 
to fetus through the placenta. Like other drug companies at this time, Merrell had not tested its drug 
on pregnant animals. Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence 
for thalidomide’s safety seemed “more like testimonials than
the results of well-designed studies.” Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application and asked them to submit a second 
backed by better evidence. Her FDA colleagues 
supported this decision. Merrell had expected a quick, 
affirmative reply so it could launch thalidomide
for the holiday season, when sedative sales soar. Instead of supplying Kelsey
with the data she requested they first tried to convince her
to approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file 
another application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed 
and rejected each new application, news of thalidomide’s adverse 
side effects began to surface. Doctors reported cases of nerve damage 
in early 1961, and by fall,
they’d unmasked a more horrible truth. Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant
women, caused severe birth defects. Thousands of babies died in utero, and tens of thousands more 
were born with extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all. In November 1961, thalidomide 
was pulled from the German market. Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying 
to get it approved in the US for several months before withdrawing 
their sixth and final application. While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist 
to identify the risks of thalidomide, she sounded the alarm that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar 
American drug market. As public awareness 
of the thalidomide tragedy grew, the quiet scientist 
became a media sensation. Headlines in newspapers 
and magazines heralded her heroism while a smiling President John F. Kennedy presented her an award 
on the White House lawn. After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that expanded 
the FDA’s authority and toughened requirements 
for new drug applications. Kelsey was tapped to head 
the agency’s drug investigation branch. Working at the FDA in
different capacities into her 90s, Kelsey was able to witness the changes 
her actions helped inspire. Her visibility may have dimmed since,
but her legacy endures. Privileging facts over opinions, 
and patience over shortcuts, she made evidence-based medicine
the foundation of reforms that continue to protect people today.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1960,
Frances Oldham Kelsey was one of the Food 
and Drug Administration’s newest recruits. Before the year was out, she would begin a fight that would 
save thousands of lives, though no one knew it at the time. Although she was new to the FDA,
Kelsey was no novice as a scientist. After graduating 
from high school at age 15, she enrolled 
at McGill University in Montreal and earned both undergraduate 
and master’s degrees in pharmacology. From there, she applied
for a research post at the University of Chicago’s
pharmacology department. Her acceptance letter was addressed 
to Mr. Oldham. Kelsey later joked that had her name 
been Elizabeth or Mary Jane, her career might have ended there. Fortunately, it didn’t. She earned her doctorate
in pharmacology and accepted Chicago’s invitation 
to stay as faculty, where she undertook pioneering
research on drugs and fetal safety. In 1950, she earned an MD, 
her fourth and final degree. By the time she joined the FDA, Frances Kelsey was one of the most
educated, experienced scientists around. Yet, as the newest member
of the team, Kelsey was assigned what everyone 
thought would be an easy review: an application from the
US drug company Merrell to sell a drug called thalidomide. Thalidomide was a sedative 
developed in Germany that was already being widely used 
in dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress. Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties also made it a popular remedy for pregnant
women with morning sickness. Reviewing Merrell’s application, Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s
absorption and toxicity inadequate. Today, the FDA classifies drugs based 
on their safety for a fetus. But in 1960, many experts believed 
that the placental barrier shielded a fetus from harm. Kelsey's earlier animal-based research demonstrated the opposite: drugs could pass from mother 
to fetus through the placenta. Like other drug companies at this time, Merrell had not tested its drug 
on pregnant animals. Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence 
for thalidomide’s safety seemed “more like testimonials than
the results of well-designed studies.” Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application and asked them to submit a second 
backed by better evidence. Her FDA colleagues 
supported this decision. Merrell had expected a quick, 
affirmative reply so it could launch thalidomide
for the holiday season, when sedative sales soar. Instead of supplying Kelsey
with the data she requested they first tried to convince her
to approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking 
Kelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file 
another application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed 
and rejected each new application, news of thalidomide’s adverse 
side effects began to surface. Doctors reported cases of nerve damage 
in early 1961, and by fall,
they’d unmasked a more horrible truth. Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant
women, caused severe birth defects. Thousands of babies died in utero, and tens of thousands more 
were born with extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all. In November 1961, thalidomide 
was pulled from the German market. Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying 
to get it approved in the US for several months before withdrawing 
their sixth and final application. While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist 
to identify the risks of thalidomide, she sounded the alarm that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar 
American drug market. As public awareness 
of the thalidomide tragedy grew, the quiet scientist 
became a media sensation. Headlines in newspapers 
and magazines heralded her heroism while a smiling President John F. Kennedy presented her an award 
on the White House lawn. After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that expanded 
the FDA’s authority and toughened requirements 
for new drug applications. Kelsey was tapped to head 
the agency’s drug investigation branch. Working at the FDA in
different capacities into her 90s, Kelsey was able to witness the changes 
her actions helped inspire. Her visibility may have dimmed since,
but her legacy endures. Privileging facts over opinions, 
and patience over shortcuts, she made evidence-based medicine
the foundation of reforms that continue to protect people today.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You roll out of bed and leap eight meters 
across your underground habitat. The greywater from your sink
drains into a small greenhouse where your vegetables grow. After suiting up, you head through a transport 
chute to inspect the generator. Outside, it’s pitch black - just as 
it’s been for the last 12 days. This isn’t some post-apocalyptic scenario;
it’s just another day of life on the moon. And with the European Space Agency’s idea to establish a functioning 
"moon camp" by the 2020s, that day may be
closer than we think. Of course, living on 
the moon won’t be easy. The camp envisioned is not so much
a village as an inhabited research base similar to those 
in places like Antarctica. But there are far greater obstacles to
living on the moon than just cold weather. The biggest is cosmic radiation. Unlike the Earth, the moon has 
no atmosphere and no magnetic field. A person on its surface can receive 
over 400 times the maximum safe dosage of heavy ion radiation, enough to be fatal within ten hours, 
even in a spacesuit. The first step would likely involve robots and 3D printers constructing 
covered habitats from lunar soil, or building shelters inside caves formed by lava tubes 
from the moon’s volcanic past. But what would the inhabitants live on? Supplies would need to be transported 
from Earth at first. Growing plants requires greenhouse soil 
and air rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that’s rare on the moon, but could be synthesized 
from recycled materials. A water treatment plant could be supplied 
by ice mined from the polar regions using a specialized drill that can bore 
two meters beneath the lunar surface. Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary 
to the human microbiome and immune system would also have to be imported 
or synthesized on site. And lunar inhabitants would have 
to exercise for hours a day to maintain bone and muscle mass. That’s because the moon’s gravity 
is just one-sixth that of the Earth, and the everyday strain of working 
against gravity is part of what keeps our bodies healthy. It might seem strange to go 
to all this trouble to build a base on a dead rock 
we’ve already visited. But NASA’s Apollo missions only explored 
small portions of the moon. We’ve made many discoveries since then, such as ice near the poles and particles 
of solar wind gases that date back billions of years. They collectively show that the moon 
has much more to teach us about the history of our solar system. A radio telescope on its far side could 
observe the cosmos, shielded from the Earth’s electromagnetic
interference. And the lunar surface is rich in minerals,
like silicon, aluminum, and magnesium, creating great economic 
potential for mining. But the biggest benefit of the moon camp 
may not lie on the moon but beyond it. With the nearest possibly habitable 
world light-years away, and the International Space Station 
to be retired in about a decade, a moon base would be our first foothold towards becoming 
an interplanetary species. And proposals such as 
the Deep Space Gateway envision launching future 
missions from lunar orbit. The smaller gravitational pull 
would require less fuel to overcome, allowing for larger ships and more cargo. Meanwhile, the base on the surface 
could serve as a testing ground for future space operations, a refueling station, and a supply depot all in one. With Europe, Russia, China, and the US 
expressing interest in the project, the moon camp may come to involve the space agencies of all major nations, 
as well as private companies. Within a few decades, the moon may be bustling 
with mining operations, research stations, and tourist routes alongside a construction yard 
under an orbiting space port. We may have already visited the moon, but now we’re closer than ever 
to making it part of humanity’s home.

no atmosphere and no magnetic field. A person on its surface can receive 
over 400 times the maximum safe dosage of heavy ion radiation, enough to be fatal within ten hours, 
even in a spacesuit. The first step would likely involve robots and 3D printers constructing 
covered habitats from lunar soil, or building shelters inside caves formed by lava tubes 
from the moon’s volcanic past. But what would the inhabitants live on? Supplies would need to be transported 
from Earth at first. Growing plants requires greenhouse soil 
and air rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that’s rare on the moon, but could be synthesized 
from recycled materials. A water treatment plant could be supplied 
by ice mined from the polar regions using a specialized drill that can bore 
two meters beneath the lunar surface. Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary 
to the human microbiome and immune system would also have to be imported 
or synthesized on site. And lunar inhabitants would have 
to exercise for hours a day to maintain bone and muscle mass. That’s because the moon’s gravity 
is just one-sixth that of the Earth, and the everyday strain of working 
against gravity is part of what keeps our bodies healthy. It might seem strange to go 
to all this trouble to build a base on a dead rock 
we’ve already visited. But NASA’s Apollo missions only explored 
small portions of the moon. We’ve made many discoveries since then, such as ice near the poles and particles 
of solar wind gases that date back billions of years. They collectively show that the moon 
has much more to teach us about the history of our solar system. A radio telescope on its far side could 
observe the cosmos, shielded from the Earth’s electromagnetic
interference. And the lunar surface is rich in minerals,
like silicon, aluminum, and magnesium, creating great economic 
potential for mining. But the biggest benefit of the moon camp 
may not lie on the moon but beyond it. With the nearest possibly habitable 
world light-years away, and the International Space Station 
to be retired in about a decade, a moon base would be our first foothold towards becoming 
an interplanetary species. And proposals such as 
the Deep Space Gateway envision launching future 
missions from lunar orbit. The smaller gravitational pull 
would require less fuel to overcome, allowing for larger ships and more cargo. Meanwhile, the base on the surface 
could serve as a testing ground for future space operations, a refueling station, and a supply depot all in one. With Europe, Russia, China, and the US 
expressing interest in the project, the moon camp may come to involve the space agencies of all major nations, 
as well as private companies. Within a few decades, the moon may be bustling 
with mining operations, research stations, and tourist routes alongside a construction yard 
under an orbiting space port. We may have already visited the moon, but now we’re closer than ever 
to making it part of humanity’s home.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks, formed by five streets that 
run west to east, intersecting five more 
that run north to south. You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax 
on all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive 
at their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east, and doubles for every block 
you walk south. However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer halves your total bill for
every block you walk north and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice 
in any direction? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map 
to consider your options. Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver. But what happens when you walk 
around a single block? If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again 
and going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller 
than it started. The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way
to reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city. From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple. As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If the pilgrim traveled east, east, south, south, south, south to reach the temple, what would his tax be?
Options: A. 100, B. 64, C. 128, D. 256
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the pilgrim's final tax bill after walking the remaining blocks to the temple?
Options: A. 8 silver owed to the city, B. 0 silver owed to the city, C. The city owes the pilgrim 8 silver, D. The city owes the pilgrim 1 silver

**Transcript**:
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks, formed by five streets that 
run west to east, intersecting five more 
that run north to south. You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax 
on all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive 
at their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east, and doubles for every block 
you walk south. However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer halves your total bill for
every block you walk north and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice 
in any direction? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map 
to consider your options. Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver. But what happens when you walk 
around a single block? If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again 
and going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller 
than it started. The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way
to reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city. From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple. As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
After months of travel, 
you’ve arrived at Duonia, home to the famous temple that’s 
the destination of your pilgrimage. Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates 
and the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists
of 16 blocks, formed by five streets that 
run west to east, intersecting five more 
that run north to south. You’re standing on the
northernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate 
and the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies 
at the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, 
but there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax 
on all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive 
at their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver 
for every block you walk east, and doubles for every block 
you walk south. However, a recent reform 
to make the tax fairer halves your total bill for
every block you walk north and subtracts two silver 
for every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate 
and the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money 
and have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules 
of your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of
ground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach 
the temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice 
in any direction? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map 
to consider your options. Walking towards the temple 
always increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it
without owing silver. But what happens when you walk 
around a single block? If you start out owing four silver
and go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves 
you owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again 
and going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns 
you one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller 
than it started. The key here is that while the different 
taxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied 
makes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would 
get you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, 
since you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way
to reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop
through the city. From your starting position, 
walk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost 
street clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise 
means going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall 
and you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west 
cuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here 
—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, 
and the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt 
of -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number 
still gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall
means the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks 
to the temple. As you enter, you realize what 
you’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route 
is the best way to reach your destination.

**Transcript**:
In 1963, a 21-year-old physicist 
named Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a rare
neuromuscular disorder called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
or ALS. Gradually, he lost the ability to walk, use his hands, move his face, and even swallow. But throughout it all,
he retained his incredible intellect, and in the more
than 50 years that followed, Hawking became one of history’s most 
accomplished and famous physicists. However, his condition went uncured and he passed away in 2018 
at the age of 76. Decades after his diagnosis, ALS still ranks as one 
of the most complex, mysterious, and devastating 
diseases to affect humankind. Also called motor neuron disease 
and Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS affects about two out of every
100,000 people worldwide. When a person has ALS, their motor neurons, the cells responsible for all voluntary 
muscle control in the body, lose function and die. No one knows exactly why
or how these cells die and that’s part of what 
makes ALS so hard to treat. In about 90% of cases, the disease arises suddenly, 
with no apparent cause. The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary, where a mother or father with ALS passes 
on a mutated gene to their child. The symptoms typically first appear 
after age 40. But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s,
ALS starts earlier in life. Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel 
because of how long he lived with ALS. After diagnosis, most people with 
the disease live between 2 to 5 years before ALS leads to respiratory problems 
that usually cause death. What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case
was that his ability to learn, think, and perceive with his senses 
remained intact. Most people with ALS do not experience
impaired cognition. With so much at stake 
for the 120,000 people who are diagnosed with ALS annually, curing the disease has become one of 
our most important scientific and medical challenges. Despite the many unknowns, we do have some insight into how ALS 
impacts the neuromuscular system. ALS affects two types of nerve cells 
called the upper and lower motor neurons. In a healthy body, 
the upper motor neurons, which sit in the brain’s cortex, transmit messages
from the brain to the lower motor neurons, situated in the spinal cord. Those neurons then transmit 
the message into muscle fibers, which contract or relax in response, resulting in motion. Every voluntary move we make occurs because of messages transmitted 
along this pathway. But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS, their ability to transfer 
messages is disrupted, and that vital signaling system 
is thrown into chaos. Without their regular cues, 
the muscles waste away. Precisely what makes 
the motor neurons degenerate is the prevailing 
mystery of ALS. In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic 
mutations on to their children. Even then, ALS involves multiple genes with multiple possible impacts 
on motor neurons, making the precise triggers
hard to pinpoint. When ALS arises sporadically,
the list of possible causes grows: toxins, viruses, lifestyle, or other environmental factors 
may all play roles. And because there are 
so many elements involved, there’s currently no single test that
can determine whether someone has ALS. Nevertheless, our hypotheses 
on the causes are developing. One prevailing idea is that certain
proteins inside the motor neurons aren’t folding correctly, and are instead forming clumps. The misfolded proteins and clumps 
may spread from cell to cell. This could be clogging up normal
cellular processes, like energy and protein production, 
which keep cells alive. We’ve also learned that along with 
motor neurons and muscle fibers, ALS could involve other
cell types. ALS patients typically have inflammation 
in their brains and spinal cords. Defective immune cells may also play 
a role in killing motor neurons. And ALS seems to change the
behavior of specific cells that provide support for neurons. These factors highlight 
the disease’s complexity, but they may also give us a fuller
understanding of how it works, opening up new avenues for treatment. And while that may be gradual,
we’re making progress all the time. We’re currently developing new drugs, new stem cell therapies 
to repair damaged cells, and new gene therapies 
to slow the advancement of the disease. With our growing arsenal of knowledge, we look forward to discoveries
that can change the future for people living with ALS.

**Transcript**:
In 1963, a 21-year-old physicist 
named Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a rare
neuromuscular disorder called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, 
or ALS. Gradually, he lost the ability to walk, use his hands, move his face, and even swallow. But throughout it all,
he retained his incredible intellect, and in the more
than 50 years that followed, Hawking became one of history’s most 
accomplished and famous physicists. However, his condition went uncured and he passed away in 2018 
at the age of 76. Decades after his diagnosis, ALS still ranks as one 
of the most complex, mysterious, and devastating 
diseases to affect humankind. Also called motor neuron disease 
and Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS affects about two out of every
100,000 people worldwide. When a person has ALS, their motor neurons, the cells responsible for all voluntary 
muscle control in the body, lose function and die. No one knows exactly why
or how these cells die and that’s part of what 
makes ALS so hard to treat. In about 90% of cases, the disease arises suddenly, 
with no apparent cause. The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary, where a mother or father with ALS passes 
on a mutated gene to their child. The symptoms typically first appear 
after age 40. But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s,
ALS starts earlier in life. Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel 
because of how long he lived with ALS. After diagnosis, most people with 
the disease live between 2 to 5 years before ALS leads to respiratory problems 
that usually cause death. What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case
was that his ability to learn, think, and perceive with his senses 
remained intact. Most people with ALS do not experience
impaired cognition. With so much at stake 
for the 120,000 people who are diagnosed with ALS annually, curing the disease has become one of 
our most important scientific and medical challenges. Despite the many unknowns, we do have some insight into how ALS 
impacts the neuromuscular system. ALS affects two types of nerve cells 
called the upper and lower motor neurons. In a healthy body, 
the upper motor neurons, which sit in the brain’s cortex, transmit messages
from the brain to the lower motor neurons, situated in the spinal cord. Those neurons then transmit 
the message into muscle fibers, which contract or relax in response, resulting in motion. Every voluntary move we make occurs because of messages transmitted 
along this pathway. But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS, their ability to transfer 
messages is disrupted, and that vital signaling system 
is thrown into chaos. Without their regular cues, 
the muscles waste away. Precisely what makes 
the motor neurons degenerate is the prevailing 
mystery of ALS. In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic 
mutations on to their children. Even then, ALS involves multiple genes with multiple possible impacts 
on motor neurons, making the precise triggers
hard to pinpoint. When ALS arises sporadically,
the list of possible causes grows: toxins, viruses, lifestyle, or other environmental factors 
may all play roles. And because there are 
so many elements involved, there’s currently no single test that
can determine whether someone has ALS. Nevertheless, our hypotheses 
on the causes are developing. One prevailing idea is that certain
proteins inside the motor neurons aren’t folding correctly, and are instead forming clumps. The misfolded proteins and clumps 
may spread from cell to cell. This could be clogging up normal
cellular processes, like energy and protein production, 
which keep cells alive. We’ve also learned that along with 
motor neurons and muscle fibers, ALS could involve other
cell types. ALS patients typically have inflammation 
in their brains and spinal cords. Defective immune cells may also play 
a role in killing motor neurons. And ALS seems to change the
behavior of specific cells that provide support for neurons. These factors highlight 
the disease’s complexity, but they may also give us a fuller
understanding of how it works, opening up new avenues for treatment. And while that may be gradual,
we’re making progress all the time. We’re currently developing new drugs, new stem cell therapies 
to repair damaged cells, and new gene therapies 
to slow the advancement of the disease. With our growing arsenal of knowledge, we look forward to discoveries
that can change the future for people living with ALS.

**Transcript**:
On July 4, 2015, a NASA spacecraft called New Horizons 
was 5 billion kilometers away from Earth. It was only 10 days away from Pluto, 
after flying for 9.5 years, when it suddenly dropped out of contact. But let’s back up a little. As of 1989, mankind had successfully sent craft 
to every known planet in the solar system except one—Pluto. You may have heard that astronomers 
don’t consider Pluto or its brethren to be planets. However, most planetary 
scientists still do, which is why we're using 
that terminology here. There’s a limited amount 
we can learn about Pluto from Earth because it’s so far from us. Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine. It’s located in a region 
called the Kuiper Belt, home to many small planets, hundreds of thousands 
of ancient icy objects, and trillions of comets. This mysterious region holds clues 
to the formation of our solar system, and it was long, 
tantalizingly beyond our reach. Until New Horizons. Its objectives: explore Pluto, collect as much scientific 
data as possible, transmit it back to Earth, then explore farther out 
in the Kuiper Belt. To achieve this, the New Horizons team 
outfitted their craft with seven state-of-the-art 
scientific instruments. Those included Ralph, a set of cameras powerful enough to capture features the size 
of city blocks in Manhattan from tens of thousands of kilometers away. And REX, designed to use radio waves to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure 
and temperature. All of the onboard equipment had to be
built to be both reliable and lightweight because New Horizons had an
additional challenge; it had to reach its target 
as fast as possible. Why? Around 2020, Pluto will reach 
a point in its orbit where its atmosphere could freeze. And due to the tilt of its axis, more and more of Pluto’s surface 
is shrouded in darkness every year. Pluto completes a full orbit
once every 248 Earth years, so it would be a long wait 
for the next prime opportunity to visit. To see how New Horizons 
got to Pluto in time, let’s jump to its launch. Its three rocket stages accelerated 
New Horizons to such great speeds that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers 
to the moon in just nine hours. About a year later, 
the craft reached Jupiter and got what’s called a gravity assist. That’s where it flies close enough
to the gas giant to receive a gravitational
slingshot effect. New Horizons was then flying 
at around 50,000 kilometers per hour, as it would for the next eight years 
to cross the remaining gulf to Pluto. Going at such an astonishing speed meant that slowing down 
to get into orbit or land would’ve been impossible. That’s why New Horizons was on 
a flyby mission, where it would get just one chance to
scream by Pluto and make its observations. The flyby would have 
to be fully automated, since at that distance, any signals 
to guide it from Earth would take 4.5 hours to reach it. So the team loaded the ship’s computer 
with a series of thousands of commands, called the core load, that would begin to execute 
when the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto. But when New Horizons 
was just ten days out, disaster almost struck. Ground control lost contact 
with the spacecraft. After two nerve-wracking hours,
New Horizons came back online, but mission control discovered 
that its main computer had rebooted, losing the entire core load 
and other critical data. Without that, it would soon 
whizz by Pluto with virtually nothing 
to show for the mission. Alice Bowman, 
the mission’s Operations Manager, led a team for 72 sleepless hours 
to get the instructions loaded back into New Horizons in time. Without room for a single error,
she and her team pulled it off, and New Horizons began taking 
and broadcasting breathtaking images. Those observations have revealed 
a delightfully varied world, with ground fogs, high altitude hazes, possible clouds, canyons, towering mountains, faults, craters, polar caps, glaciers, apparent dune fields, suspected ice volcanoes, evidence for past flowing liquids, and more. One of the most exciting discoveries is the 1000-kilometer-wide
Sputnik Planitia glacier. Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed 
of slowly churning frozen nitrogen, and we’ve never seen anything 
like it in our solar system. The exploration of Pluto 
was a great success, but New Horizons isn’t done yet. On January 1, 2019, it’ll break its own record for 
furthest explored object when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object 
called 2014 MU69, which is orbiting the sun another billion
kilometers farther away than Pluto. The world is holding its breath 
to see what it’ll find there.

**Transcript**:
On July 4, 2015, a NASA spacecraft called New Horizons 
was 5 billion kilometers away from Earth. It was only 10 days away from Pluto, 
after flying for 9.5 years, when it suddenly dropped out of contact. But let’s back up a little. As of 1989, mankind had successfully sent craft 
to every known planet in the solar system except one—Pluto. You may have heard that astronomers 
don’t consider Pluto or its brethren to be planets. However, most planetary 
scientists still do, which is why we're using 
that terminology here. There’s a limited amount 
we can learn about Pluto from Earth because it’s so far from us. Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine. It’s located in a region 
called the Kuiper Belt, home to many small planets, hundreds of thousands 
of ancient icy objects, and trillions of comets. This mysterious region holds clues 
to the formation of our solar system, and it was long, 
tantalizingly beyond our reach. Until New Horizons. Its objectives: explore Pluto, collect as much scientific 
data as possible, transmit it back to Earth, then explore farther out 
in the Kuiper Belt. To achieve this, the New Horizons team 
outfitted their craft with seven state-of-the-art 
scientific instruments. Those included Ralph, a set of cameras powerful enough to capture features the size 
of city blocks in Manhattan from tens of thousands of kilometers away. And REX, designed to use radio waves to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure 
and temperature. All of the onboard equipment had to be
built to be both reliable and lightweight because New Horizons had an
additional challenge; it had to reach its target 
as fast as possible. Why? Around 2020, Pluto will reach 
a point in its orbit where its atmosphere could freeze. And due to the tilt of its axis, more and more of Pluto’s surface 
is shrouded in darkness every year. Pluto completes a full orbit
once every 248 Earth years, so it would be a long wait 
for the next prime opportunity to visit. To see how New Horizons 
got to Pluto in time, let’s jump to its launch. Its three rocket stages accelerated 
New Horizons to such great speeds that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers 
to the moon in just nine hours. About a year later, 
the craft reached Jupiter and got what’s called a gravity assist. That’s where it flies close enough
to the gas giant to receive a gravitational
slingshot effect. New Horizons was then flying 
at around 50,000 kilometers per hour, as it would for the next eight years 
to cross the remaining gulf to Pluto. Going at such an astonishing speed meant that slowing down 
to get into orbit or land would’ve been impossible. That’s why New Horizons was on 
a flyby mission, where it would get just one chance to
scream by Pluto and make its observations. The flyby would have 
to be fully automated, since at that distance, any signals 
to guide it from Earth would take 4.5 hours to reach it. So the team loaded the ship’s computer 
with a series of thousands of commands, called the core load, that would begin to execute 
when the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto. But when New Horizons 
was just ten days out, disaster almost struck. Ground control lost contact 
with the spacecraft. After two nerve-wracking hours,
New Horizons came back online, but mission control discovered 
that its main computer had rebooted, losing the entire core load 
and other critical data. Without that, it would soon 
whizz by Pluto with virtually nothing 
to show for the mission. Alice Bowman, 
the mission’s Operations Manager, led a team for 72 sleepless hours 
to get the instructions loaded back into New Horizons in time. Without room for a single error,
she and her team pulled it off, and New Horizons began taking 
and broadcasting breathtaking images. Those observations have revealed 
a delightfully varied world, with ground fogs, high altitude hazes, possible clouds, canyons, towering mountains, faults, craters, polar caps, glaciers, apparent dune fields, suspected ice volcanoes, evidence for past flowing liquids, and more. One of the most exciting discoveries is the 1000-kilometer-wide
Sputnik Planitia glacier. Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed 
of slowly churning frozen nitrogen, and we’ve never seen anything 
like it in our solar system. The exploration of Pluto 
was a great success, but New Horizons isn’t done yet. On January 1, 2019, it’ll break its own record for 
furthest explored object when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object 
called 2014 MU69, which is orbiting the sun another billion
kilometers farther away than Pluto. The world is holding its breath 
to see what it’ll find there.

The finish line's in sight
and you put on an extra burst of speed. As your legs pick up the pace,
your breathing gets deeper, your heart pounds faster, and sweat pours over your skin. How does this substance
suddenly materialize and what exactly is its purpose? There are a number of scenarios
that can make us sweat: eating spicy foods, nervousness, and when we're sick. But exercise is probably the most familiar
and common. In that case, sweating happens 
as a response to movement triggered deep inside your cells. As you increase your pace,
your muscles work harder, increasing their demand for energy. A process called cellular respiration consumes glucose 
and oxygen to form ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Much of this process takes place
in structures called mitochondria. The more you move, the harder mitochondria work
to supply your body with energy. All this work comes at a cost, though. As the cells break down the ATP,
they release heat. The heat stimulates temperature sensors
throughout your body. Those receptors detect the excess heat
being produced by your muscle cells and communicate that information
to the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. The hypothalamus responds by sending signals out through 
the sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands in your skin. These are distributed all over the body with especially high concentrations
on the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, and on your head. When a sweat gland first receives
the signal, the fluid surrounding the cells
in its coiled base contains high amounts 
of sodium and chloride. The cells pump these ions
into a hollow tube that runs through the sweat gland. Then, because it's saltier inside
the tube than outside, water moves into the tube by osmosis. As what's called the primary secretion
builds up in the bottom of the tube, water pressure pushes it up
into the long straight part of the duct. Before it seeps onto the skin, cells lining the tube will reclaim
as much salt as possible so the process can continue. The water in sweat absorbs 
your body's heat energy and then evaporates off of you
when it reaches the surface, which in turn lowers your temperature. This process, 
known as evaporative cooling, was an important adaptation 
for our ancestors. This cooling effect isn't only helpful
during exercise. We sweat in many other scenarios, too. Eating particularly spicy food makes some
people sweat profusely from their faces. That happens because spices trigger
the same neural response in the brain that activates temperature receptors,
which usually respond to increased heat. Sweating is also part of 
the fight or flight response stimulated by stressful scenarios,
like asking someone on a date or interviewing for a job. This happens because adrenaline
stimulates muscle activity and causes blood vessels to widen, two responses that increase heat
and trigger the sweating response. And sweating also occurs 
when we get sick. When we're feverish,
we sweat because infections stimulate the hypothalamus 
to increase muscle activity, which in turn releases 
more energy as heat. That increases your overall temperature, a protective mechanism that makes your
body less habitable for infectious agents. Like with running, sweating helps
your body vent that heat. When the fever's over 
or you've won your race, your temperature receptors 
sense the decrease in heat and the hypothalamus brings 
your sweating response to an end. In some cases, like after a run, the hypothalamus also signals
to your body that you need to replenish the water
that you've oozed out. So, when you're pushing yourself
to reach that next goal, you can think of sweat as your body's
very own calibrator, enabling you to go that extra mile.

as a response to movement triggered deep inside your cells. As you increase your pace,
your muscles work harder, increasing their demand for energy. A process called cellular respiration consumes glucose 
and oxygen to form ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Much of this process takes place
in structures called mitochondria. The more you move, the harder mitochondria work
to supply your body with energy. All this work comes at a cost, though. As the cells break down the ATP,
they release heat. The heat stimulates temperature sensors
throughout your body. Those receptors detect the excess heat
being produced by your muscle cells and communicate that information
to the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. The hypothalamus responds by sending signals out through 
the sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands in your skin. These are distributed all over the body with especially high concentrations
on the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, and on your head. When a sweat gland first receives
the signal, the fluid surrounding the cells
in its coiled base contains high amounts 
of sodium and chloride. The cells pump these ions
into a hollow tube that runs through the sweat gland. Then, because it's saltier inside
the tube than outside, water moves into the tube by osmosis. As what's called the primary secretion
builds up in the bottom of the tube, water pressure pushes it up
into the long straight part of the duct. Before it seeps onto the skin, cells lining the tube will reclaim
as much salt as possible so the process can continue. The water in sweat absorbs 
your body's heat energy and then evaporates off of you
when it reaches the surface, which in turn lowers your temperature. This process, 
known as evaporative cooling, was an important adaptation 
for our ancestors. This cooling effect isn't only helpful
during exercise. We sweat in many other scenarios, too. Eating particularly spicy food makes some
people sweat profusely from their faces. That happens because spices trigger
the same neural response in the brain that activates temperature receptors,
which usually respond to increased heat. Sweating is also part of 
the fight or flight response stimulated by stressful scenarios,
like asking someone on a date or interviewing for a job. This happens because adrenaline
stimulates muscle activity and causes blood vessels to widen, two responses that increase heat
and trigger the sweating response. And sweating also occurs 
when we get sick. When we're feverish,
we sweat because infections stimulate the hypothalamus 
to increase muscle activity, which in turn releases 
more energy as heat. That increases your overall temperature, a protective mechanism that makes your
body less habitable for infectious agents. Like with running, sweating helps
your body vent that heat. When the fever's over 
or you've won your race, your temperature receptors 
sense the decrease in heat and the hypothalamus brings 
your sweating response to an end. In some cases, like after a run, the hypothalamus also signals
to your body that you need to replenish the water
that you've oozed out. So, when you're pushing yourself
to reach that next goal, you can think of sweat as your body's
very own calibrator, enabling you to go that extra mile.

**Transcript**:
Onboard the spacecraft, 
the astronauts preset the timer, enclose themselves in capsules, and fall into a deep hibernation that’ll carry them several 
hundred years into the future. This is a familiar scene 
in many sci-fi films, but could humans ever actually 
hibernate in real life? Researchers interested in this question 
turn to the animal kingdom, where hibernation is commonplace, occurring in over 200 species 
that we know of. Take the Arctic ground squirrel. Native to the North American tundra 
and northern Russia, this animal burrows 
beneath the permafrost and slips into a state 
of suspended animation, its body temperature plummeting 
to a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius. Others, like the female black bear, 
can multitask, giving birth and lactating while they’re
hibernating through the winter. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares 
for its long dormancy by gorging on food and storing the 
majority of its fat reserves in its tail, doubling its body weight. After hibernation, it emerges looking 
as svelte as ever. So why do these animals 
go to such extremes? Hibernation is a necessity, a survival tactic for making it 
through the harsh winter months when dwindling food 
and water reserves threaten survival. For many years, experts believed 
hibernation happened only in arctic and temperate environments. But more recently, they’ve discovered 
animals hibernating even in arid deserts 
and tropical rainforests. As hibernation kicks in, animals’ heartbeats usually slow to
about 1 to 3% of their original speed, like the dwarf lemur’s, which drops from its usual 
roughly 180 beats per minute to just around four. Breathing also declines dramatically to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes 
in the lemur’s case. And black bears, like most hibernators, don’t urinate 
or defecate the entire hibernation season. Hibernating animals appear to stay alive by having just enough blood
and oxygen moving around their bodies. And scans of hibernating animals 
reveal that their brain activity has just about flat-lined. But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap. As far as researchers know, in lemurs and
ground squirrels anyway, the animals aren’t even 
sleeping for most of it. Hibernation is actually made up of regular
bouts of reduced metabolic rate and body temperature known as torpor. Animals can be in torpor 
for a few days to five weeks, after which they resume normal 
metabolic rate and body temperature for about 24 hours, before going back into torpor again. The phenomenon is known 
as an interbout arousal, and why it occurs is still a mystery. The behaviors inherent in hibernation, like going five weeks without sleep, or dropping to 
near-freezing body temperatures would be potentially fatal 
to non-hibernating species like us. To find out how hibernators 
are able to do this, researchers turned their attention
to those animal’s genomes. So far, they’ve discovered that
hibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in
unique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology 
and behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear 
and dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these
animals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use 
their fat stores as fuel to survive 
long periods of fasting. And the genes in question 
are present in all mammals, which means that researchers could
study hibernating mammals to see how their unique control 
of physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal 
with reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments 
for protecting the brain during a stroke. Figuring out how these animals avoid
muscle deterioration might improve the lives 
of bedridden patients. And studying how hibernating animals 
control their weight with ease could illuminate the relationship between
metabolism and weight gain in humans. And yes, more research in this area might someday make 
human hibernation a real possibility. Imagine our surprise if the key to
intergalactic travel turns out to be ground squirrels, 
black bears, and dwarf lemurs.

Evaluation Prompt:

**Transcript**:
Onboard the spacecraft, 
the astronauts preset the timer, enclose themselves in capsules, and fall into a deep hibernation that’ll carry them several 
hundred years into the future. This is a familiar scene 
in many sci-fi films, but could humans ever actually 
hibernate in real life? Researchers interested in this question 
turn to the animal kingdom, where hibernation is commonplace, occurring in over 200 species 
that we know of. Take the Arctic ground squirrel. Native to the North American tundra 
and northern Russia, this animal burrows 
beneath the permafrost and slips into a state 
of suspended animation, its body temperature plummeting 
to a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius. Others, like the female black bear, 
can multitask, giving birth and lactating while they’re
hibernating through the winter. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares 
for its long dormancy by gorging on food and storing the 
majority of its fat reserves in its tail, doubling its body weight. After hibernation, it emerges looking 
as svelte as ever. So why do these animals 
go to such extremes? Hibernation is a necessity, a survival tactic for making it 
through the harsh winter months when dwindling food 
and water reserves threaten survival. For many years, experts believed 
hibernation happened only in arctic and temperate environments. But more recently, they’ve discovered 
animals hibernating even in arid deserts 
and tropical rainforests. As hibernation kicks in, animals’ heartbeats usually slow to
about 1 to 3% of their original speed, like the dwarf lemur’s, which drops from its usual 
roughly 180 beats per minute to just around four. Breathing also declines dramatically to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes 
in the lemur’s case. And black bears, like most hibernators, don’t urinate 
or defecate the entire hibernation season. Hibernating animals appear to stay alive by having just enough blood
and oxygen moving around their bodies. And scans of hibernating animals 
reveal that their brain activity has just about flat-lined. But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap. As far as researchers know, in lemurs and
ground squirrels anyway, the animals aren’t even 
sleeping for most of it. Hibernation is actually made up of regular
bouts of reduced metabolic rate and body temperature known as torpor. Animals can be in torpor 
for a few days to five weeks, after which they resume normal 
metabolic rate and body temperature for about 24 hours, before going back into torpor again. The phenomenon is known 
as an interbout arousal, and why it occurs is still a mystery. The behaviors inherent in hibernation, like going five weeks without sleep, or dropping to 
near-freezing body temperatures would be potentially fatal 
to non-hibernating species like us. To find out how hibernators 
are able to do this, researchers turned their attention
to those animal’s genomes. So far, they’ve discovered that
hibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in
unique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology 
and behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear 
and dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these
animals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use 
their fat stores as fuel to survive 
long periods of fasting. And the genes in question 
are present in all mammals, which means that researchers could
study hibernating mammals to see how their unique control 
of physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal 
with reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments 
for protecting the brain during a stroke. Figuring out how these animals avoid
muscle deterioration might improve the lives 
of bedridden patients. And studying how hibernating animals 
control their weight with ease could illuminate the relationship between
metabolism and weight gain in humans. And yes, more research in this area might someday make 
human hibernation a real possibility. Imagine our surprise if the key to
intergalactic travel turns out to be ground squirrels, 
black bears, and dwarf lemurs.

**Transcript**:
As far as we know, there’s only one thing in our solar system
sophisticated enough to study itself: the human brain. But this self-investigation 
is incredibly challenging; a living brain is shielded 
by a thick skull, swaddled in layers of protective tissue, and made up of billions of tiny,
connected cells. That’s why it’s so difficult to isolate, 
observe, and understand diseases like Alzheimer’s. So how do we study living brains 
without harming their owners? We can use a trio of techniques 
called EEG, fMRI, and PET. Each measures something different 
and has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll look at each in turn. First is EEG, or electroencephalography, which measures electrical 
activity in your brain. As brain cells communicate, 
they produce waves of electricity. Electrodes placed on the skull pick
up these waves, and differences in the signals detected 
between electrodes provide information 
about what’s happening. This technique was invented 
almost 100 years ago, and it’s still used to diagnose conditions
like epilepsy and sleep disorders. It’s also used to investigate what areas 
of the brain are active during learning or paying attention. EEG is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and fast: it can measure changes that occur 
in just milliseconds. Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine exactly where any particular 
pattern originates. Electrical signals are generated 
constantly all over the brain and they interact with each other to
produce complex patterns. Using more electrodes or sophisticated 
data-processing algorithms can help. But in the end, while EEG can tell you 
precisely when certain activity occurs, it can’t tell you precisely where. To do that, you’d need another technique, such as functional magnetic 
resonance imaging, or fMRI. fMRI measures how quickly oxygen 
is consumed by brain cells. Active areas of the brain use
oxygen more quickly. So watching an fMRI scan while a person
completes cognitive or behavioral tasks can provide information about which 
regions of the brain might be involved. That allows us to study everything
from how we see faces to how we understand what we’re feeling. fMRI can pinpoint differences in brain
activity to within a few millimeters, but it’s thousands 
of times slower than EEG. Using the two techniques together can help show when,
and where, neural activity is occurring. The third, even more precise, technique
is called positron emission tomography and it measures radioactive elements 
introduced into the brain. That sounds much scarier 
than it actually is; PET scans, like fMRI and EEG, 
are completely safe. During a PET scan, a small amount
of radioactive material called a tracer is injected into the bloodstream, and doctors monitor its
circulation through the brain. By modifying the tracer
to bind to specific molecules, researchers can use PET to study 
the complex chemistry in our brains. It’s useful for studying 
how drugs affect the brain and detecting diseases like Alzheimer’s. But this technique has 
the lowest time resolution of all because it takes minutes for the tracer 
to circulate and changes to show up. These techniques collectively 
help doctors and scientists connect what happens in the
brain with our behavior. But they’re also limited 
by how much we still don't know. For example, let's say researchers are
interested in studying how memory works. After asking 50 participants to memorize 
a series of images while in MRI scanners, the researchers might analyze the results and discover a number 
of active brain regions. Making a link between memory 
and specific parts of the brain is an important step forward. But future research would be necessary to better understand 
what’s happening in each region, how they work together, and whether the activity is because 
of their involvement in memory or another process 
occurring simultaneously. More advanced imaging 
and analysis technology might one day provide 
more accurate results and even distinguish the activity of individual neurons. Until then, our brains will
keep measuring, analyzing, and innovating in pursuit of that quest to understand one of the most remarkable things 
we’ve ever encountered.

**Transcript**:
As far as we know, there’s only one thing in our solar system
sophisticated enough to study itself: the human brain. But this self-investigation 
is incredibly challenging; a living brain is shielded 
by a thick skull, swaddled in layers of protective tissue, and made up of billions of tiny,
connected cells. That’s why it’s so difficult to isolate, 
observe, and understand diseases like Alzheimer’s. So how do we study living brains 
without harming their owners? We can use a trio of techniques 
called EEG, fMRI, and PET. Each measures something different 
and has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll look at each in turn. First is EEG, or electroencephalography, which measures electrical 
activity in your brain. As brain cells communicate, 
they produce waves of electricity. Electrodes placed on the skull pick
up these waves, and differences in the signals detected 
between electrodes provide information 
about what’s happening. This technique was invented 
almost 100 years ago, and it’s still used to diagnose conditions
like epilepsy and sleep disorders. It’s also used to investigate what areas 
of the brain are active during learning or paying attention. EEG is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and fast: it can measure changes that occur 
in just milliseconds. Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine exactly where any particular

**MCQ Pair**:

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If a researcher observes activity in a specific part of the brain while a person does a specific task (such as remembering a face), what can they conclude?
Options: A. There is some link between activity in that specific part of the brain and that specific task, B. Any activity observed in that specific part of the brain means a person is doing that specific task, C. That specific part of the brain works by itself to help a person do that specific task, D. All of the above
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: A researcher is interested in studying how memory works. What would be the best approach to take?
Options: A. Use EEG to measure electrical activity in the brain, B. Use fMRI to measure oxygen consumption in the brain, C. Use PET to study the complex chemistry in the brain, D. Use a combination of techniques, such as EEG and fMRI, to get a more comprehensive understanding
Correct Option: D

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.6000 (The generated question is related to the topic of brain research, but it doesn't directly address the conclusion that can be drawn from observing activity in a specific part of the brain.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.0000 (The correct answer options do not match between the ground truth and generated questions.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.8000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible, but they don't directly relate to the conclusion that can be drawn from observing activity in a specific part of the brain.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (Both questions are clear and easy to understand.)
- Total Score: 0.5750

Note: The generated question does not directly match the ground truth question in terms of content and intent. A more suitable generated question would be one that asks about the conclusion that can be drawn from observing activity in a specific part of the brain, with options that match the ground truth question.
