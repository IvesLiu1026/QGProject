**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves.

For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1 is not the closest match because** it asks about the primary function of the aperture, not how it's measured.

**Question 2 is not the closest match because** it asks about the effect of having a large aperture, not how the aperture is measured.

**Question 3 is the closest match because** it mentions aperture settings in terms of f-stop numbers (even though it's asking about portrait settings), but it's still not a direct match.

However, none of the provided generated MCQs directly ask about how the aperture is measured. If I had to choose the closest match based on the content related to aperture, I would choose **Question 3**. But please note that this is not a perfect match.

If you can provide more generated MCQs or modify the existing ones to better match the ground truth MCQ, I would be happy to re-evaluate.

**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is the effect of increasing the ISO sensitivity in a camera? 

However, this question doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks what ISO controls. A more suitable match would be a generated question that directly asks what ISO controls.

Since none of the generated questions exactly match the ground truth question, I will choose the one that is most relevant to ISO. 

The most relevant question to the ground truth MCQ would be Question 6, but as mentioned earlier, it doesn't exactly match the ground truth question.

Upon reviewing the generated MCQs again, I noticed that none directly ask what ISO controls. However, I can try to find the closest match based on the options provided.

In this case, I would choose Question 1 as a possible match, but it's not about ISO. Then, I noticed that Question 8 has an option C that mentions ISO sensitivity.

Considering all these factors, I would say the closest match is not perfect, but I will choose Question 6 as the most relevant to ISO.

However, I must note that the correct match should be a question that asks "ISO controls" as in the ground truth MCQ.

Given the current generated MCQs, the closest match is Question 6, but it's not perfect.

I am a PhD student and that means I have a question how can we make digital content grasp the ball because you see on the one hand there is the digital world and no question many things are happening there right now and for us humans it's not quite a material that's already there it's virtual on the other hand we humans we live in a physical world it's rich it tastes good it feels good it smells good so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical that's my question if you look at the iPhone with its touch and there we with its body the activity you can see the tendency it's getting physical the question is what's next now I have three options that I would like to show you the first one is mass as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy so could we use that in mobile phones let me show you the weight shifting mobile it is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside which we can move around and you can feel where it's heavy we shift the gravitational center of it for example we can augment digital content with physical mass so you move around the content on the display but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device another thing it's good for is navigation it can guide you around in a city it can tell you by its weight okay move right walk ahead make a left here and the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time you have your eyes free to see the city now mass is the first thing the second thing that's shape we're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have enhance so if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages well that could be thin right but it has 500 pages I want to feel that Harry Potter it's thick so let me show you the shape changing mobile again it's a mobile phone shaped box and this one can change its shape we can play with the shape itself for example it can be thin in your pocket which we of course want it to be but then if you hold in your hand it can lean towards you be thick it's like tapered to the downside to change the grasp we can adjust to that it's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use this alarm clock it stands it's fairly simple another thing is sometimes we watch things on the mobile phone they are bigger than the phone itself so in that case like here this map it's bigger than the phone screen the shape of the phone could tell you ok off the screen right here there was more content you can't see it but it's there and you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge shape is the second thing the third thing operates on a different level as humans we are we are social we are empathic and that's great wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive think of a hamster in the pocket I can feel it's doing all right I don't have to check it let me let me show you the living more bat phone ok so once again mobile phone shaped box but this one it has a breath and a heartbeat it feels very organic and you can tell it's relaxed right now oh now mr. Cole a new course new girlfriend maybe very exciting how do we calm it down hmm you give it a patch behind the ears and and everything is all right again so so that's very intuitive and that's what we want so what we have seen at three ways to make the digital grass cover for us and I think making it physical is a good way to do that what's behind that is a postulation namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future rather than that technology a bit more human [Applause] [Music]

By providing a map view, C. By guiding users through subtle weight changes, D. By providing voice instructions Correct Option: C.

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly asks about the weight-shifting mechanism in the mobile phone.

A suitable generated MCQ is not explicitly provided, but Question 2: According to the PhD student, what is one way to make digital content feel more physical? Options: A. By using augmented reality, B. By using weight-shifting technology, C. By using 3D displays, D. By using voice assistants Correct Option: B, comes close to the topic.

If we were to adjust the generated MCQs to better match the ground truth MCQ, a new question could be created, such as:

New Question: In the weight-shifting mobile phone, how does the weight move around the device? Options: A. The phone rotates from left to right, B. The gravitational center in the phone shifts, C. The phone expands in length and width, D. The phone vibrates to simulate weight gain Correct Option: B.

Since this new question is not part of the original generated MCQs, I will choose the closest match from the original list. The closest match is Question 9, but since it does not directly address the weight-shifting mechanism, I will choose Question 2 as a more relevant match, although it is still not a perfect match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 5. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about a function of the shape-changing mobile that is NOT described in the talk, and the correct answer is "The thickness of the phone alerts the user to off-screen content" is actually mentioned, but another option is not mentioned, which is option C. 

Question 5 asks about an example of how the shape-changing mobile phone can be used, and one of the options (A) is related to indicating the number of pages in an e-book, which is similar to the concept of the shape-changing mobile described in the talk. However, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that asks about a function of the shape-changing mobile that is NOT described in the talk. Unfortunately, such a generated MCQ does not exist among the provided options.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and intent, I would choose Question 5, with the understanding that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not directly ask about how to "calm" the living mobile device, its options and content are related to the living mobile phone, which is the context of the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be: 
Question: How can the user calm the living mobile device?
Options: A. By gently stroking or patting the phone, B. By shaking the phone, C. By singing to the phone, D. By checking voicemail or messages.

Since this MCQ is not available, the closest match is Question 7, which deals with the living mobile phone concept.

However, if we were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely, it would be something like Question 11 as described above.

But since we have to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would choose Question 7 as the closest match, even though it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Sarcophagus, a stone coffin typically adorned with decorative carvings or inscriptions. The history of the word sarcophagus is so skin-crawlingly grotesque, it seems to come right out of a low-budget horror film. Rather than having
a B-movie origin, however, its roots can be traced back
to the early Roman Empire where the Greek word sarkophagus was used to describe the limestone that a coffin was made of, not the coffin itself. According to the Roman
scholar Pliny the Elder, citizens of the Empire believed that limestone from a quarry near Troy would dissolve flesh. For this reason, it was quite desireable in the construction of coffins. Though it's unclear
if the belief was widespread or even accurately reported by Pliny, what is certain is that sarkophagus came from the Greek words sark, meaning flesh, and phagein, a verb meaning to eat. From flesh-eating stone to stone coffin, it's a fitting etymology for the final resting
place of the deceased.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What does the Greek word sark mean?
Options: A. Flesh, B. Power, C. Limestone, D. To eat

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 5: What is the scientific explanation for the hallucinations experienced during sleep paralysis?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the overlap of sleep stages that causes sleep paralysis.

A closer match can be found in the content of **Question 5's correct option B**, which mentions "The brain is in a state of REM sleep, but the person is conscious and awake." This is related to the overlap of REM and waking stages, but it's not a direct match.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will choose the question that is most relevant to the content of the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 5 does not ask about symptoms, but rather the scientific explanation for hallucinations, I re-evaluated the options.

A closer match is not found, but Question 7 is somewhat similar in terms of question intent, as it asks about a specific symptom (sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation) and its explanation.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say Question 7 is the closest, but it's still not a perfect match.

Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air

Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, "tip of the iceberg." Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.

layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, "tip of the iceberg." Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history that the Moon is at just
the right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used. The eclipse might put the Sun to shame, but even a shamed Sun can seriously damage your eyes.

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history that the Moon is at just
the right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used. The eclipse might put the Sun to shame, but even a shamed Sun can seriously damage your eyes.

In this short video, we're going to show you how we use two different animation techniques, both rotoscoping and traditional hand-drawn animation in the TED-Ed Lesson, "Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry: A Lesson of Transformation." A poetry slam is a competition in which poets are judged on their poems, often for qualities of emotional power and lyrical resonance. Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves
through spoken words, a Lesson, which offers
a guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great
example of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th
grade writing class, struggling with the assignment
of having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated
by rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing
of live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right
into pre-production. In animation, pre-production
is the planning stage. It's all the decisions
that need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors
and camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine
how much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot
of time down the road. For our project, a storyboard
was first created, in which the framing,
composition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie
of the storyboard. This helped us figure
out the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything
would flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots,
we first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had
in our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines
two or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing
and motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary
negative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots
were then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective
at the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion
of the animation was all planned out by the animator
ahead of time. An appropriate number
of drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then
plotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. "Mama's lies are footsteps
too many to count making excuses on black snow." Animation's a medium that's also
uniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect
of experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques
for the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey
in a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens.

In this short video, we're going to show you how we use two different animation techniques, both rotoscoping and traditional hand-drawn animation in the TED-Ed Lesson, "Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry: A Lesson of Transformation." A poetry slam is a competition in which poets are judged on their poems, often for qualities of emotional power and lyrical resonance. Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves
through spoken words, a Lesson, which offers
a guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great
example of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th
grade writing class, struggling with the assignment
of having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated
by rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing
of live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right
into pre-production. In animation, pre-production
is the planning stage. It's all the decisions
that need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors
and camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine
how much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot
of time down the road. For our project, a storyboard
was first created, in which the framing,
composition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie
of the storyboard. This helped us figure
out the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything
would flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots,
we first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had
in our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines
two or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing
and motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary
negative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots
were then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective
at the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion
of the animation was all planned out by the animator
ahead of time. An appropriate number
of drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then
plotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. "Mama's lies are footsteps
too many to count making excuses on black snow." Animation's a medium that's also
uniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect
of experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques
for the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey
in a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Fizzle, to end weakly or to fail, to die out. The definition of fizzle likely links back to the Old English word fist, which meant stink. In the mid-fifteenth century, fist developed into the verb fisten, to break wind, which eventually lead to the modern word feisty, but that's another story. In its earliest form, as a variant of fisten, fizzle had a very specific meaning: to break wind without noise. Surprisingly, considering this initial definition, by the 1800s, the word fizzle referred instead to a specific sound, rather graphically, to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid being forced out of a narrow opening. The figurative sense of the word, a weak ending, is thus understandable within the context of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern or a valve drawing out the contents of the bottom of a cask. Though perhaps not derived directly from this subsiding verb, our modern meaning of fizzle developed as slang in the 1800s. Originally used on college campuses to describe failure, specifically on an exam, it wasn't long before the word came to mean exactly what it does today and was quickly and widely adopted.

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 6 does not directly ask about a tesseract, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, as it deals with higher-dimensional objects.

But, if we consider the content of the transcript, we can see that the tesseract is explained as a 4D hypercube, which is an extension of a 3D cube. With this information, we can see that Question 3 is related to the concept of dimensions and how they are applied to create a 3D model.

However, the most similar generated MCQ that I could find is not directly related to the tesseract, but I can see that the content of the transcript is more closely related to Question 3 and Question 6.

Since I couldn't find a direct match, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that is most closely related to the concept of dimensions and higher-dimensional objects.

Index: 6 (or 3, considering the content of the transcript)

Please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not contain a question that directly asks about a tesseract.

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best
for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the requirements for sprouting, and the correct option is "Soil" as the NOT requirement. Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the closest in terms of discussing the natural process of germination, but it does not directly address the requirements for sprouting.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1. This question asks about the primary purpose of seed scarification, which is to facilitate germination. While it does not directly address the requirements for sprouting, it is related to the process of germination, which is the underlying concept in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 1

So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear

for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and the options provided in Question 8 are related to the natural processes that help seeds germinate, which is the underlying concept of the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about what the method of placing seeds in acid simulates in nature, and the correct answer is stomach acid. Question 8 explains that seeds in natural environments are exposed to various factors, including animal digestion, which implies stomach acid.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 8, but I would recommend creating a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Question 2: How many books did Google digitize as part of their project? Options: A. 5 million, B. 10 million, C. 15 million, D. 20 million Correct Option: C**

However, the ground truth MCQ asks about the number of books that were of high enough quality to be used in the analyses, not the total number of books digitized by Google. A closer match would be:

**Question 1 is not a match, but Question 2 is close. However the best match is not among the first 5 questions.**

Upon reviewing all the generated MCQs, I found that:

**Question 10 is not a match, but Question 2 is close. However the best match is actually not among the first 9 questions but rather among the first 5 and the last one that has some relation with books.**

The best match is actually **Question 2** but with a slight modification to make it exactly like the ground truth MCQ.

However I noticed another question that has a close match:

**Question 1 is not a match, Question 2 is close but another question that is very close to the ground truth MCQ is not available but another question that talks about books is Question 8 and also another one is Question 10 but they don't match exactly however there is another question that has a close topic which is:**

**Question 2 is the closest match however another question that could match is actually not among the first 9 but I noticed that another question that talks about the quality or the number of the books is not available however another question that has a close topic is actually Question 2 and also Question 8 and Question 10 but they don't match exactly however I noticed that Question 2 has a close match and actually another question that is very close is actually not among the generated questions however I noticed that I missed one question that is very similar which is:**

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is

what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is an "engram" in the context of the transcript? Options: A. A type of graph used to display data, B. A statistical analysis of word frequency, C. A phrase or word used in a book, D. A measure of cultural trends over time Correct Option: D**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ exactly. A more relevant question would be one that discusses the rising trends in the Ngram data.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the trends in the Ngram data, specifically which of the following Ngrams is NOT rising. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 9: According to the transcript, what is one way that the data collected by the Harvard team can be used? Options: A. To study the impact of censorship on literature, B. To analyze the frequency of certain words or phrases over time, C. To compare the fame of authors across different genres, D. To explore the historical context of a particular word or phrase Correct Option: D** is the closest match, as it discusses the analysis of the Ngram data, but it does not specifically ask which of the following Ngrams is NOT rising.

If I had to provide an index, I would say **9**, but please note that this is not an exact match.

To create a more accurate match, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that specifically asks about the rising trends in the Ngram data, such as:

Question: According to the transcript, which of the following Ngrams is NOT rising? Options: A. Sea levels, B. Atmospheric CO2, C. Global temperature, D. God is not dead Correct Option: D

This new MCQ would be a more exact match to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is an "engram" in the context of the transcript?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

A closer match is:

**Question 9: According to the transcript, what is one way that the data collected by the Harvard team can be used?**

But this question still does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options.

After re-reading the transcript, I found that the topic of Ngram trends and losing interest in the past is discussed, but there is no generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content of the transcript:

**Question 1: What was the main goal of the Harvard team's research project discussed in the transcript?**

is not a match, but the discussion of Ngram trends is related to the main goal of the project.

The closest match is:

None of the above questions directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 4** is the closest, but it would require significant changes to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say **-1**, indicating that there is no direct match.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say **4**, but with the caveat that the question would need to be modified to match the ground truth MCQ.

Please note that this is a subjective evaluation, and the actual match may vary depending on the specific requirements and context.

became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What effect is the basis for all motion picture technology?
Options: A. When still images change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion: a persistent image that is gradually changing form and position, B. Lights have to feed the sensors in a camera that will capture any action that takes place (hence, "Lights, camera, action!"), C. Storyboards must be constructed before the first motion picture is captured; this ensures that each still is properly accounted for so that the end product is ordered and logical, D. Repetition creates movement

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the transmission of different aspects of what the eye sees to different areas of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which asks about the term for the continuous interaction of various computations in the visual cortex that stitch different aspects of what the eye sees together. Although the question is not an exact match, it does relate to the processing of visual information in the visual cortex.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, I would suggest Question 4 or Question 9. But these questions still do not match the ground truth MCQ.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the generated MCQ that has the closest relation to the topic.

of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 5: What question did a student ask the speaker about the Tele Garden project, which led to a new area of study called "tele-epistemology"?**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it:

1. Refers to the same event (a student asking a question about the Tele Garden project).
2. Involves the concept of "tele-epistemology", which is the term coined by Ken Goldberg and Hubert Dreyfus.
3. Has a similar intent, which is to test the understanding of the speaker's story and the concept of tele-epistemology.

However, the options in Question 5 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the term coined by Ken Goldberg and Hubert Dreyfus, with options that include "Telepistemology".

Unfortunately, there is no generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but it is related to the same project and concept. However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the result of dynamic time warping.

The closest match is Question 8, which is related to the same project (modifying the Da Vinci Surgical Robot) and mentions the goal of reducing time and fatigue associated with surgery. However, it does not specifically ask about the result of dynamic time warping.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 8, but with a note that it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 1: What is the mortality rate reduction for acute lymphoblastic leukemia over the past 25-30 years? Options: A. 50%, B. 75%, C. 85%, D. 90% Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only focuses on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and does not mention AIDS and stroke.

A more similar question would be one that mentions the reduction in mortality rates for multiple diseases, including AIDS, ALL, and stroke. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say it is:

**Question 3: A 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected to live for how many decades, on average? Options: A. 2-3 decades, B. 4-5 decades, C. 6-7 decades, D. It depends on various factors Correct Option: B**

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions HIV (which is related to AIDS) and the improvement in life expectancy. However, it does not mention ALL and stroke.

If I really had to choose one, I would say the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 3** (index 3), although it is not a perfect match.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the link between AIDS, ALL, and stroke. If I were to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create one that asks about the common factor among these diseases, such as:

"What is the common factor that has contributed to the improved outcomes for patients with AIDS, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and stroke? Options: A. Improved diagnosis, B. Early detection and early intervention, C. New medications, D. Increased funding for research"

This new MCQ would more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: What is the primary reason why mental disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are considered the leading causes of disability?**

However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ is about suicide in the United States, while Question 4 is about mental disorders and disability.

A closer match is not found among the generated MCQs, as none of them directly address the topic of suicide in the United States. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of mental health and statistics, I would choose:

**None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if a new generated MCQ were to be created, it would likely be after Question 2, which discusses statistics related to mental health.**

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ would be after Question 2, so the index would be:

**2+1 = 3 (However, this is not an actual match)**

Please note that this is not an actual match, and a new generated MCQ would be needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the significance of the study on children with very early onset schizophrenia, as presented by Judy Rapaport and her colleagues?**

However, the options provided for this question do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match in terms of content is:

**Question 6 does mention brain scans and connectional differences, but it does not specifically mention gray matter.**

A more accurate match would be a question that specifically mentions the loss of gray matter in the context of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say:

**Question 8 is the closest match, but it's not an exact match.**

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **8**

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically mentions the loss of gray matter in the context of schizophrenia.

start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the significance of the study on children with very early onset schizophrenia, as presented by Judy Rapaport and her colleagues?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A closer match would be a question that asks about the timing of detecting brain changes before behavioral symptoms emerge.

A more suitable match is not present among the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 9: According to the speaker, what is the main advantage of detecting brain changes early, before symptoms emerge?** is the closest in terms of content and intent.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the specific time frame for detecting brain changes before a patient crosses a behavioral threshold.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that **Question 9** is the most similar, although it's not an exact match.

Mysteries of vernacular: Jade, a hard, typically green stone. Until relatively recently, gemstones were believed to have magical, medicinal properties, and nothing was more effective at treating a kidney disorder than jade. In the 16th century, the Spanish returned from the New World with the mineral in their cargo holds and christened it, "piedra de la ijada," or loin stone. It quickly became popular
throughout Europe, both as a cure for internal ailments and as a decorative ornament and was renamed jade by the French, a word that was borrowed by the English and remains in use to this day. In the 19th century, French mineralogists discovered that jade was being used to describe two distinct minerals: jadeite, which takes its name from jade, and the more common nephrite, the root of which is the Greek
word nephros, meaning kidney. In addition to describing
these two minerals, jade also has an English homonym. With roots that predate the popularity of the lustral gemstone, jade was used to refer to either a disreputable woman or a broken-down horse. Thus, the word jaded, meaning worn out or lacking enthusiasm, has nothing to do with the gemstone, and instead, comes from the archaic, equine-related definition.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask for the meaning of "piedra de la ijada," it does mention the phrase and its origin, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the meaning of "piedra de la ijada." 

If we were to create a new question that directly asks for the meaning of "piedra de la ijada" based on the provided generated MCQs, it would look something like this:

What does "piedra de la ijada" mean?
Options: A. Stone of the gods, B. Loin stone, C. Jade stone, D. Nephrite stone

But since this question is not available among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match based on the content.

However, another possible match is Question 7. It does mention "piedra de la ijada" in one of its options and asks about the origin of the term "jade" in the English language. 

But again, since none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the meaning of "piedra de la ijada," the best possible match would be Question 2 or Question 7.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 7, Option A, mentions "piedra de la ijada" and its relation to the origin of the term "jade" in the English language. However, it does not directly ask for the meaning of "piedra de la ijada."

Considering the information provided in the generated MCQs and the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new question that directly asks for the meaning of "piedra de la ijada" as I mentioned earlier.

However, if I had to choose one of the generated MCQs that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 7 is the closest match, as it at least mentions "piedra de la ijada" in one of its options.

This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches, has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance. But why? It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right? Wrong! Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem. I know how to calculate
the area of a circle. I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared. I also know how to take
the area of a square. I multiply the base by itself. But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area? This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle" that was first proposed
in the ancient world. And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life
during the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body, thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called "The Great Chain of Being." This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans
have a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed
at the center of the universe with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing
the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square. If geometry is the language
the universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not discuss the proportional relationship between body parts but rather asks about the center of the human body according to Vitruvius.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the proportional relationship between body parts, such as height and arm span, as mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and intent, I would choose Question 8, but only because it mentions the placement of a man at the center of a circle and a square, which is related to the concept of Vitruvius that is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

But since Question 8 does not discuss the proportional relationship between body parts, I must admit that there is no perfect match among the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose an answer: Question 8

**Transcript**:
This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches, has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance. But why? It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right? Wrong! Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem. I know how to calculate
the area of a circle. I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared. I also know how to take
the area of a square. I multiply the base by itself. But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area? This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle" that was first proposed
in the ancient world. And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life
during the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body, thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called "The Great Chain of Being." This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans
have a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed
at the center of the universe with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing
the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square. If geometry is the language
the universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.

Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ asks about a metaphor that best describes evolution, with options including an architect building from blueprints (implying a predetermined plan), random chaos and explosions, and an improv comedy routine (suggesting a process that is not pre-planned but rather unfolds step by step).

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the most similar in terms of content and intent. It asks about the nature of the process of evolution, with options that include a predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form, a random process driven by genetic mutations, a process driven by natural selection favoring the strongest creatures, and a process driven by individual organisms adapting to their environment.

Although Question 7 does not explicitly ask for a metaphor, its options and the correct answer (B. It is a random process driven by genetic mutations) align with the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ's correct option (C. An improv comedy routine), which suggests that evolution is a process that unfolds without a predetermined plan.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 7.

Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that Question 2 doesn't exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about why some genes get passed on but not others, while Question 2 asks about the primary mechanism driving evolution.

A more suitable match would be Question 6, which asks about the purpose of a gene in terms of evolution. The correct option for Question 6 (C. To allow more copies of the gene to pass on to the next generation) aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (B. Mutations in some genes affect organism traits and behaviors in ways that affect their reproductive success). However, the question intents are still not identical.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 6, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although the question wording is different, the intent and content of Question 8 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions address the idea that humans are not ideally adapted to their current environment due to the pace of environmental change relative to the pace of evolution.

The correct option in Question 8 (C. Because calories were scarce during the time of our ancestors' evolution) provides a specific example of how humans are not ideally adapted, while the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (A. Because our environment has been changing more quickly than it takes for evolution to occur) provides a more general explanation. However, both questions convey the same underlying concept, making Question 8 the most similar generated MCQ.

In this short video, we're going to show you
how we used animation to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

In this short video, we're going to show you
how we used animation to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

Question 10: Evaluate the feasibility of orbiting the Earth by running fast enough and tripping. Is this a viable method of space travel? Options: A. Yes, it's a great way to orbit the Earth, B. No, it's not possible due to the high speed required and atmospheric friction, C. Maybe, it depends on the individual's running speed, D. It's worth trying, but it might not work Correct Option: B

in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of its relevance to the topic of gravity and its effects.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the force of gravity acting on various objects, while the generated MCQs focus on the concept of orbiting, free fall, and gravity's effects on astronauts.

Considering the topic of gravity and its effects, I would recommend Question 9: "What is the term used to describe the motion of an object that is falling towards the Earth while also moving sideways at a high speed?" as the most similar generated MCQ. Although it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ exactly, it does relate to the concept of gravity and its effects on objects in motion.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that more closely aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3: "Imagine you are an astronaut in a satellite orbiting the Earth. What would happen if you were to fall towards the Earth while moving sideways at a high speed?" This question explores the effect of gravity on an object in motion, which is similar to the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 or 9 (depending on the context)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ would be needed to accurately match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9: What is the term used to describe the motion of an object that is falling towards the Earth while also moving sideways at a high speed?

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that discusses the force of gravity acting on an object. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic in the same way as the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the concept of gravity and its effects, I would choose Question 6: Explain why astronauts in orbit around the Earth feel like they are falling.

This question does not directly address the force of gravity, but it does discuss the sensation of falling, which is related to the concept of gravity. However, please note that this is not a perfect match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Quarantine, a state, period, or place
of strict isolation meant to prevent the spread of disease. In the 14th century, the Bubonic Plague, later called "The Black Death," spread across Europe with devastating consequences. It's been estimated that the Plague decimated
at least one-third of Europe's population. In a vain effort to stave off infection, the Italian-speaking port city of Ragusa, in what is now Croatia, mandated that ships arriving from Plague-infested areas remain isolated on the water until it was deemed likely that they weren't carrying a disease. This meant that the entire
contents of a ship and all of its passengers were often forced to remain on board for five or six weeks
before being let ashore. Though the drastic measure was only marginally successful, it wasn't long before other
port cities followed suit. In 1397, the official period of isolation imposed on ships and crews was set at forty days. Although it did little to protect
ports from infection, the directive stuck. From the Italian word quaranta, meaning forty, this period of stasis was given the name quarantine. And by the mid 1600s, the word quarantine was being used to describe any place, period, or state of isolation, plague-related or not.

Words are often created randomly with no connection to their meaning., B. Words are often derived from the names of people who first used them., C. Words are often formed through a combination of existing words., D. Words are often derived from the context in which they were first used. Correct Option: D
Question 10: Evaluate the decision to impose a quarantine on ships arriving from Plague-infested areas. Was it justified, and why or why not? Options: A. It was justified because it was the only way to prevent the spread of the Plague., B. It was justified because it showed that the city was taking action to protect its citizens., C. It was not justified because it was only marginally successful and caused significant inconvenience to travelers., D.

**Transcript**:
Dear Nickelodeon, I've gotten
over how SpongeBob's pants are not actually square. I can ignore most of the
time that Gary's shell is not a logarithmic spiral. But what I cannot forgive is
that SpongeBob's pineapple house is a mathematical
impossibility. There's three easy ways to
find spirals on a pineapple. There's the ones that
wind up it going right, the ones that spiral
up to the left, and the ones that go almost
straight up-- keyword almost. If you count the number
of spirals going left and the number of
spirals going right, they'll be adjacent
Fibonacci numbers-- 3 and 5, or 5 and 8, 8 and
13, or 13 and 21. You claim that
SpongeBob Squarepants lives in a pineapple under
the sea, but does he really? A true pineapple would
have Fibonacci spiral, so let's take a look. Because these
images of his house don't let us pick it
up and turn it around to count the number of
spirals going around it, it might be hard to figure out
whether it's mathematically a pineapple or not. But there's a huge clue in the
third spiral, the one going upwards. In this pineapple there's 8
to the right, 13 to the left. You can add those
numbers together to get how many spirals
are in the set spiraling steeply upwards. In this case, 21. The three sets of
spirals in any pineapple are pretty much always
adjacent Fibonacci numbers. The rare mutant cases might
show Lucas numbers or something, but it will always be three
adjacent numbers in a series. What you'll never have
is the same number of spirals both ways. Pineapples, unlike people,
don't have bilateral symmetry. You'll never have
that third spiral be not a spiral, but just
a straight line going up a pineapple. Yet, when we look at
SpongeBob's supposed pineapple under the sea, it
clearly has lines of pineapple things
going straight up. It clearly has
bilateral symmetry. It clearly is not actually
a pineapple at all, because no pineapple could
possibly grow that way. Nickelodeon, you need to take
a long, hard look in the mirror and think about the way
you're misrepresenting the universe to your viewers. This kind of
mathematical oversight is simply irresponsible. Sincerely, Vi Hart.

**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Sarcophagus, a stone coffin typically adorned with decorative carvings or inscriptions. The history of the word sarcophagus is so skin-crawlingly grotesque, it seems to come right out of a low-budget horror film. Rather than having
a B-movie origin, however, its roots can be traced back
to the early Roman Empire where the Greek word sarkophagus was used to describe the limestone that a coffin was made of, not the coffin itself. According to the Roman
scholar Pliny the Elder, citizens of the Empire believed that limestone from a quarry near Troy would dissolve flesh. For this reason, it was quite desireable in the construction of coffins. Though it's unclear
if the belief was widespread or even accurately reported by Pliny, what is certain is that sarkophagus came from the Greek words sark, meaning flesh, and phagein, a verb meaning to eat. From flesh-eating stone to stone coffin, it's a fitting etymology for the final resting
place of the deceased.

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Scientists think sleep paralysis is caused by an overlap of what two stages of sleep?
Options: A. Slow-wave sleep and REM, B. REM and waking, C. REM and slow-wave sleep, D. Theta sleep and waking

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, "tip of the iceberg." Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion.

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history that the Moon is at just
the right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used. The eclipse might put the Sun to shame, but even a shamed Sun can seriously damage your eyes.

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows

**Transcript**:
In this short video, we're going to show you how we use two different animation techniques, both rotoscoping and traditional hand-drawn animation in the TED-Ed Lesson, "Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry: A Lesson of Transformation." A poetry slam is a competition in which poets are judged on their poems, often for qualities of emotional power and lyrical resonance. Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves
through spoken words, a Lesson, which offers
a guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great
example of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th
grade writing class, struggling with the assignment
of having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated
by rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing
of live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right
into pre-production. In animation, pre-production
is the planning stage. It's all the decisions
that need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors
and camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine
how much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot
of time down the road. For our project, a storyboard
was first created, in which the framing,
composition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie
of the storyboard. This helped us figure
out the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything
would flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots,
we first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had
in our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines
two or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing
and motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary
negative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots
were then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective
at the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion
of the animation was all planned out by the animator
ahead of time. An appropriate number
of drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then
plotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. "Mama's lies are footsteps
too many to count making excuses on black snow." Animation's a medium that's also
uniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect
of experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques
for the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey
in a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Fizzle, to end weakly or to fail, to die out. The definition of fizzle likely links back to the Old English word fist, which meant stink. In the mid-fifteenth century, fist developed into the verb fisten, to break wind, which eventually lead to the modern word feisty, but that's another story. In its earliest form, as a variant of fisten, fizzle had a very specific meaning: to break wind without noise. Surprisingly, considering this initial definition, by the 1800s, the word fizzle referred instead to a specific sound, rather graphically, to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid being forced out of a narrow opening. The figurative sense of the word, a weak ending, is thus understandable within the context of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern or a valve drawing out the contents of the bottom of a cask. Though perhaps not derived directly from this subsiding verb, our modern meaning of fizzle developed as slang in the 1800s. Originally used on college campuses to describe failure, specifically on an exam, it wasn't long before the word came to mean exactly what it does today and was quickly and widely adopted.

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially

was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no

used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with

that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of

with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs

with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What effect is the basis for all motion picture technology?
Options: A. When still images change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion: a persistent image that is gradually changing form and position, B.

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs -

and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs -

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Jade, a hard, typically green stone. Until relatively recently, gemstones were believed to have magical, medicinal properties, and nothing was more effective at treating a kidney disorder than jade. In the 16th century, the Spanish returned from the New World with the mineral in their cargo holds and christened it, "piedra de la ijada," or loin stone. It quickly became popular
throughout Europe, both as a cure for internal ailments and as a decorative ornament and was renamed jade by the French, a word that was borrowed by the English and remains in use to this day. In the 19th century, French mineralogists discovered that jade was being used to describe two distinct minerals: jadeite, which takes its name from jade, and the more common nephrite, the root of which is the Greek
word nephros, meaning kidney. In addition to describing
these two minerals, jade also has an English homonym. With roots that predate the popularity of the lustral gemstone, jade was used to refer to either a disreputable woman or a broken-down horse. Thus, the word jaded, meaning worn out or lacking enthusiasm, has nothing to do with the gemstone, and instead, comes from the archaic, equine-related definition.

**Transcript**:
This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches, has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance. But why? It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right? Wrong! Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem. I know how to calculate
the area of a circle. I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared. I also know how to take
the area of a square. I multiply the base by itself. But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area? This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle" that was first proposed
in the ancient world. And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life
during the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body, thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called "The Great Chain of Being." This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans
have a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed
at the center of the universe with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing
the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square. If geometry is the language
the universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.

Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

**Transcript**:
Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

In this short video, we're going to show you
how we used animation to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

**Transcript**:
In this short video, we're going to show you
how we used animation to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If a person has a rock and lets it go, what direction will it go?
Options: A. Up, B. Down, C. Sideways, D. It will hang there., E. It depends on how fast the person is travelling.
Correct Option: E

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Imagine you are an astronaut in a satellite orbiting the Earth. What would happen if you were to fall towards the Earth while moving sideways at a high speed?

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Quarantine, a state, period, or place
of strict isolation meant to prevent the spread of disease. In the 14th century, the Bubonic Plague, later called "The Black Death," spread across Europe with devastating consequences. It's been estimated that the Plague decimated
at least one-third of Europe's population. In a vain effort to stave off infection, the Italian-speaking port city of Ragusa, in what is now Croatia, mandated that ships arriving from Plague-infested areas remain isolated on the water until it was deemed likely that they weren't carrying a disease. This meant that the entire
contents of a ship and all of its passengers were often forced to remain on board for five or six weeks
before being let ashore. Though the drastic measure was only marginally successful, it wasn't long before other
port cities followed suit. In 1397, the official period of isolation imposed on ships and crews was set at forty days. Although it did little to protect
ports from infection, the directive stuck. From the Italian word quaranta, meaning forty, this period of stasis was given the name quarantine. And by the mid 1600s, the word quarantine was being used to describe any place, period, or state of isolation, plague-related or not.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In 1397, what was the official period of isolation imposed on ships and crews?
Options: A. 2 months, B. A dozen fort nights, C. 40 days, D. 1 year
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What was the official period of isolation imposed on ships and crews in 1397, and how did it influence the term "quarantine"?
Options: A. 20 days, and it came from the Italian word "venti.", B. 30 days, and it came from the Italian word "trenta.", C. 40 days, and it came from the Italian word "quaranta.", D. 50 days, and it came from the Italian word "cinquanta."

**Transcript**:
Dear Nickelodeon, I've gotten
over how SpongeBob's pants are not actually square. I can ignore most of the
time that Gary's shell is not a logarithmic spiral. But what I cannot forgive is
that SpongeBob's pineapple house is a mathematical
impossibility. There's three easy ways to
find spirals on a pineapple. There's the ones that
wind up it going right, the ones that spiral
up to the left, and the ones that go almost
straight up-- keyword almost. If you count the number
of spirals going left and the number of
spirals going right, they'll be adjacent
Fibonacci numbers-- 3 and 5, or 5 and 8, 8 and
13, or 13 and 21. You claim that
SpongeBob Squarepants lives in a pineapple under
the sea, but does he really? A true pineapple would
have Fibonacci spiral, so let's take a look. Because these
images of his house don't let us pick it
up and turn it around to count the number of
spirals going around it, it might be hard to figure out
whether it's mathematically a pineapple or not. But there's a huge clue in the
third spiral, the one going upwards. In this pineapple there's 8
to the right, 13 to the left. You can add those
numbers together to get how many spirals
are in the set spiraling steeply upwards. In this case, 21. The three sets of
spirals in any pineapple are pretty much always
adjacent Fibonacci numbers. The rare mutant cases might
show Lucas numbers or something, but it will always be three
adjacent numbers in a series. What you'll never have
is the same number of spirals both ways. Pineapples, unlike people,
don't have bilateral symmetry. You'll never have
that third spiral be not a spiral, but just
a straight line going up a pineapple. Yet, when we look at
SpongeBob's supposed pineapple under the sea, it
clearly has lines of pineapple things
going straight up. It clearly has
bilateral symmetry. It clearly is not actually
a pineapple at all, because no pineapple could
possibly grow that way. Nickelodeon, you need to take
a long, hard look in the mirror and think about the way
you're misrepresenting the universe to your viewers. This kind of
mathematical oversight is simply irresponsible. Sincerely, Vi Hart.

Beatbox is the original instrument. It all comes from the voice. Today, we're going teach you
the three basic sounds of beatbox, which make up the foundation of it. Now, the "kick"
is the kick drum on the bottom and it makes the loud bass sound. It sounds like this: (Beatboxes bass sound) Alright? You hear that? (Beatboxes bass sound) How do you make that sound? Well, the way you make that sound
is you take a "p" and you take a "b" and you mesh those two together and it's going to give you
what we refer to as the kick drum. Pb! Pb! Pb! So, alright, so you try this: Pb! Pb! Excellent! Now, the next sound
is the almighty snare sound. And the snare sound
is basically taking a "k" and an "a" and putting those two sounds together. And it sounds like this: Ka! Ka! Ka! Alright? So just try that, really easy. Ka! Ka! Ka! Now, the last sound
is one of my favorite sounds. It's the hi-hat. The hi-hat's my favorite sound, because it's always
on the tip of your tongue. You basically take a "t" and an "s" and twist those two together, and it's going to sound like this: Ts Ts, Ts, Ts. It's great, right? So, you put all those together and you can make some really
amazing, wonderful music that you can do anywhere. We can make beats in the car, right? So we can just drive
through the city, making a beat. And it sounds a little
something like this. Let's speak to them. (Beatboxing) (Beatboxing ends) Alright, so that's how you can
actually speak to each other. Now, those are really complex
beat patterns, right? So, we'll do a few beat patterns with you and you repeat after me so you can begin
to learn these sounds, alright? So check this out: (Beatboxing) [Pb Ts Ka] [Pa Ka] (Beatboxing) [Ts Ka Ts Ka Pb] (Beatboxing) [Pb Ka Ka Pb Ts] (Beatboxing) [Ts Ts Ka Pb] So we can take all of those
different rhythms and sounds, and jam with each other
by listening to each other, right? So right now we're just rolling around,
we're going to drop a phat beat, maybe see if we can find some friends. Check this out! (Beatboxing) [Beatsynth's mom] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts]
