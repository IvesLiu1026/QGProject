**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only mentions the solidarity movement in Poland, whereas the ground truth MCQ mentions multiple historical movements (Civil Rights Movement, Indian Independence, Czech self-determination).

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that mentions multiple historical movements, similar to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 9** (although it's not a perfect match)

However, I would like to note that a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that mentions multiple historical movements, such as:

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not specifically ask about "expanding the frame of the possible," it does ask about the strategy of "choosing a defining fight," which is closely related to the concept of expanding the frame of the possible. The correct option for Question 3, "Activists pushing for a $15 minimum wage in the U.S.," is also the same example used in the ground truth MCQ to illustrate the concept of expanding the frame of the possible.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the broader concepts and strategies discussed in the transcript, rather than the specific example of Seattle's fight for a $15 minimum wage.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would choose Question 3. However, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,

were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle

about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 1 is not a match**: It asks about the definition of self-assembly, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about where self-assembly can be observed.

**Question 5 is not a match**: It asks about the advantages of self-assembly, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about where self-assembly can be observed.

However, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if we had to choose one that is closest in terms of content and intent, it would be:

**Question 9 is not a perfect match, but Question 1's option D and Question 9 can give a clue**: Our bodies use self-assembly, while man-made objects do not, and option D of question 1 says "A technique used only in biology and chemistry." However, Question 1 asks for the definition of self-assembly, and Question 9 asks for the difference between our bodies and man-made objects.

Considering the options of the generated MCQs, we can propose a new question with the same options as the ground truth MCQ:

**Generated Question**: Where can self-assembly be observed?
Options: A. Only in biological and chemical processes, B. In a limited range of scientific phenomena, C. Across various fields, from magnets to social networks, D. Solely within the realm of robotics and social media

Since this question doesn't exist among the generated MCQs, we will choose the one that has the closest options and content.

**The closest generated MCQ is Question 1**, because its option D implies a limitation on where self-assembly can be observed (only in biology and chemistry), which is similar to option A of the ground truth MCQ.

However, keep in mind that this is not a perfect match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

[Music] when it comes to tasks that we're more familiar with like problem solving and coming up with creative ideas and strategies or new products and businesses the power of cognitive diversity is even more profound and perhaps a good way to make the point conceptually is to imagine you're putting together a group of 10 people in the team to come up with creative ideas to do the next big thing in your business or organization and let's also assume that this is a talented group of people each of whom comes up with 10 genuinely useful ideas so 10 people in the team each of whom is coming up with 10 useful ideas how many useful ideas do you have in total this is a slightly trick question because you think one would think a hundred ten people ten ideas each but if they're cognitively homogeneous if they think in the same way and they come up with the same 10 ideas you only have 10 overall if on the other hand they are cognitively diverse and come up with different ideas from one another you could have a hundred useful ideas in the space of innovation which is going to dominate the future of our economy our political institutions and more engineering cognitive diversity relative to the context you get this massive uplift in what i call collective intelligence and the tragedy is two things one a psychological point we are attracted unconsciously to people who think like us when people are mirroring our perspective back to us it makes us feel smarter it validates our world view the pleasure centers of our brains light up in brain scanners when people are telling us things we already suspect or believe all confirm our prejudices and can you see the problem when it's a simple task that's fine any one person has a solution you surround yourself with like-minded others you are able to deliver the solution but as the complexity increases and no one brain is sufficient to solve the problem when you're attracted to people who think in the same way you're getting no uplift at all in collective intelligence and by mirroring each other's perspectives you become more confident about a solution that might be gravely mistaken this is why cognitive diversity is so important and i believe will become the key feature of competitive advantage for the next 50 years but here's another thing it's not just a psychological problem it's a conceptual one whilst research in the book i talked to one of the most eminent economic forecasters in the world and he said if i truly believe that my model is the best one out there then by definition i should be working with people who think like me that logic is extremely compelling it is also spectacularly wrong wow [Music] you

However, this question does not directly ask about the number of ideas generated by a cognitively diverse team. A more similar question would be one that directly addresses the concept of idea generation.

A closer match would be:

They come up with the same ideas as each other, C. They fail to generate any useful ideas, D. They become less confident in their solutions Correct Option: B**

However, this question still does not directly ask about the number of ideas generated by a cognitively diverse team.

The closest match would be a question that directly addresses the concept of idea generation in a cognitively diverse team. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the number of ideas generated by a cognitively diverse team.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the concept of idea generation, I would choose:

**Question 1: What is the primary benefit of having a cognitively diverse team when it comes to tasks like problem-solving and coming up with creative ideas? Options: A. Increased productivity, B. Improved communication, C. A larger pool of useful ideas, D. Reduced conflict Correct Option: C**

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that Question 4 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent. A more suitable match would be Question 5, as it deals with the scenario in which surrounding oneself with like-minded individuals is beneficial, or rather, not beneficial.

But an even better match would be none of the above questions. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 5

**Transcript**:
[Music] when it comes to tasks that we're more familiar with like problem solving and coming up with creative ideas and strategies or new products and businesses the power of cognitive diversity is even more profound and perhaps a good way to make the point conceptually is to imagine you're putting together a group of 10 people in the team to come up with creative ideas to do the next big thing in your business or organization and let's also assume that this is a talented group of people each of whom comes up with 10 genuinely useful ideas so 10 people in the team each of whom is coming up with 10 useful ideas how many useful ideas do you have in total this is a slightly trick question because you think one would think a hundred ten people ten ideas each but if they're cognitively homogeneous if they think in the same way and they come up with the same 10 ideas you only have 10 overall if on the other hand they are cognitively diverse and come up with different ideas from one another you could have a hundred useful ideas in the space of innovation which is going to dominate the future of our economy our political institutions and more engineering cognitive diversity relative to the context you get this massive uplift in what i call collective intelligence and the tragedy is two things one a psychological point we are attracted unconsciously to people who think like us when people are mirroring our perspective back to us it makes us feel smarter it validates our world view the pleasure centers of our brains light up in brain scanners when people are telling us things we already suspect or believe all confirm our prejudices and can you see the problem when it's a simple task that's fine any one person has a solution you surround yourself with like-minded others you are able to deliver the solution but as the complexity increases and no one brain is sufficient to solve the problem when you're attracted to people who think in the same way you're getting no uplift at all in collective intelligence and by mirroring each other's perspectives you become more confident about a solution that might be gravely mistaken this is why cognitive diversity is so important and i believe will become the key feature of competitive advantage for the next 50 years but here's another thing it's not just a psychological problem it's a conceptual one whilst research in the book i talked to one of the most eminent economic forecasters in the world and he said if i truly believe that my model is the best one out there then by definition i should be working with people who think like me that logic is extremely compelling it is also spectacularly wrong wow [Music] you

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world
are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues
onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have
long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary,
is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters 
were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled 
by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate 
lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally 
passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for
peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame
of the possible. How often have you heard
in response to a policy idea, "That's just never going to happen"? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries
of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push
those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens
of conventional politics is the first step in converting
protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what
it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer
healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable
for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them
from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy,
choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life
in the abstract. We think about things in relief
compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms
of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate
you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence
of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for
a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself
can fix inequality, but with this ambitious 
and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle
and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate
about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame 
of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast,
strategy two. The third key strategy, then,
is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not 
as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes 
what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland
emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980
that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort 
that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion
a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors
one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history 
of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special
to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant
and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator 
of what comes next.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere. You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

You could try to put the pieces together one-by-one, but it might take a long time and you would still have human errors. Instead you could design a connection between the components like magnets and dump them into a container. When you shook the container, all the parts would find one another and build the sphere for you. Self assembly is being used as a new design, science, and engineering tool for making the next generation of technologies easier to build, more adaptive, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Scientists are now making molecular microchips for computers where small, molecular elements are given the right conditions to form themselves into organized pathways. Similarly, we can now use self assembly as a way to make 3-D structures with DNA, like capsules that could deliver drugs inside the body, releasing them only if certain conditions are met. Soon, self assembly will be used for larger applications, where materials can repair themselves, water pipes can reconfigure on demand, buildings can adapt on their own to environment or dynamic loading, and space structures can self assemble without humans. Imagine if our factories were more like organisms or brains and our construction sites were like gardens that grow and adapt independently. The possibilities are endless and it's now up to us to design a better world through self assembly.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Have you ever wondered how things are built within our bodies? Why our bodies can regrow and repair themselves, and how we can pass on genes from one generation to the next? Yet, none of our man-made objects have these traits; they're simply thrown away when they break and they definitely can't reproduce. The answer lies in something called self assembly. Self assembly is a system where unordered parts come together in an organized structure, completely on their own. This means that a pile of parts on your desk should, in theory, be able to move around on their own, find one another, and build something useful. This seems impossible, like Transformers or the Sandman, but it's exactly how our bodies are built, how our immune system works, and why we can reproduce. Self assembly is the factory and copy machines within our bodies that make proteins fold and DNA replicate. It's a process that not only happens in the biological and chemical world, but is a phenomenon that can be seen from magnets to snowflakes, robotics, social networks, the formations of cities and galaxies, to name just a few. In biology and chemistry, self assembly is everywhere, from atomic interactions, cellular replication to DNA, RNA, and protein folding. Proteins are like bicycle chains with sequences of amino acid links. They self assemble into 3-D structures because of the interaction between the amino acids along the chain, as well as the relationship between the chain and the environment. These forces make the flexible chain fold into a 3-D shape that governs the function in the protein. Viruses, on the other hand, are like soccer balls. They're made up of a series of sub-units with specific shapes. Those shapes have attraction to one another, so they fit together in precise ways. Image you want to build a perfect sphere. It turns out that making a precise sphere through traditional means is actually quite difficult. Alternatively, you could try to self assemble the sphere. One way would be to inflate the sphere like a bubble or a balloon. Another option would be to create many identical pieces that would come together to make a perfect sphere.
