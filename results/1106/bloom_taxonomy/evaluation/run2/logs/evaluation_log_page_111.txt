**Transcript**:
After stalking an unsuspecting cuttlefish
across the seafloor, this moray eel is finally ready to pounce. As the eel snags the mollusk
in its long teeth, its prey struggles to escape. But before it can wriggle away, a second set of teeth lunge
from the eel's throat, making short work of the captive
cuttlefish. This adaptation is called
a pharyngeal jaw. And while it might seem more fitting
for an alien parasite than a fish, it's actually one of the most common
adaptations under the sea. At some point millions of years ago, early fish evolved a jointed oral jaw
from one of the bony arches that supported their frontal gills. This exterior, oral jaw was perfect
for capturing or chewing prey, but these early fish had a problem. They had no limbs to manipulate food
while eating, making it easy for their mobile prey
to escape before they took the first bite. Essentially, it was impossible for fish
to capture and chew their prey at the same time with just one set
of jaws. So to hold their food and eat it too, an even deeper gill arch evolved
into a secondary set of jaws. Unlike oral jaws connected
by a bone joint, these pharyngeal jaws were suspended
in muscle, offering them a wide range of motion
to turn, tug, and tear on food. Some pharyngeal jaws actively chew, while others retract to pull chunks
of food down the throat. Of course, the teeth a jaw has
also factor in here. For example, an oral jaw with fangs
is exceptional for catching and holding on to fast-moving prey. But depending on what that prey is, a fish might want sharp pharyngeal teeth
to tear through tissue, flat pharyngeal molars to grind
plant matter, or a powerful pharyngeal bite
to crush shelled prey. Fortunately some fishes can change
their secondary teeth to match a new diet over several years. This flexibility allows fish to adapt and find food in a huge variety
of aquatic environments. Some pharyngeal jaws have formed
to eat food too hard for most fishes. California Sheephead use pointed teeth
from their oral jaws to pry urchins off rocks before crushing
their spiny exteriors in strong pharyngeal jaws that have fused
with the bones of their skulls. Other fish prioritize eating
huge quantities of food. The pharyngeal jaws of grass carp
have two bone components that move in unison to pull plant life
into their stomachs, consuming over 18 kilograms
of seaweed a day. Other pharyngeal jaws are adapted
to suit incredibly specific circumstances. Consider this species of pearlfish that
lives inside sea cucumbers and feeds on their guts. Fish are the most diverse group
of vertebrates with over 30,000 unique species, and much of that diversity is due
to the hundreds of unique jaws separating otherwise identical species. Perhaps the best example of this
dental diversity can be seen in cichlids. This family of fish is primarily found in
select African and South American lakes. Typically, large lakes like these
would be occupied by a handful of distantly related species, each adapted to consume one
of the lake's limited food sources. But here, almost every corner
of the ecosystem is occupied by a different species
of cichlid. There are over 1,700 cichlid species, many almost identical save
for their uniquely adapted jaws which have evolved to eat crustaceans,
mollusks, worms, algae, plankton, and even the scales of other fish. These oral adaptations are so essential
for survival, that different species use their
pharyngeal jaws to make unique mating sounds that allow female cichlids to identify
males of their own species. This technique limits
interspecies breeding, and ensures the parent fish will
pass on their specialized jaws. Scientists are still discovering
all the ways this incredible skeletal mechanism
functions. But given what we know already,
it's fair to say that for most fish, two jaws are better than one.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided set. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can identify a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the origin of the pharyngeal jaws, and the correct option is "The gill arches." While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks about the origin of the pharyngeal jaws, Question 1 mentions the pharyngeal jaw as an adaptation and provides some context about its function.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that discusses the evolution or development of the pharyngeal jaw. In this case, Question 2 provides some context about the problem that early fish faced, which led to the evolution of the pharyngeal jaw. But it doesn't directly address the origin of the pharyngeal jaw.

Considering the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would suggest Question 2, as it provides some context about the evolution of the pharyngeal jaw.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

from one of the bony arches that supported their frontal gills. This exterior, oral jaw was perfect
for capturing or chewing prey, but these early fish had a problem. They had no limbs to manipulate food
while eating, making it easy for their mobile prey
to escape before they took the first bite. Essentially, it was impossible for fish
to capture and chew their prey at the same time with just one set
of jaws. So to hold their food and eat it too, an even deeper gill arch evolved
into a secondary set of jaws. Unlike oral jaws connected
by a bone joint, these pharyngeal jaws were suspended
in muscle, offering them a wide range of motion
to turn, tug, and tear on food. Some pharyngeal jaws actively chew, while others retract to pull chunks
of food down the throat. Of course, the teeth a jaw has
also factor in here. For example, an oral jaw with fangs
is exceptional for catching and holding on to fast-moving prey. But depending on what that prey is, a fish might want sharp pharyngeal teeth
to tear through tissue, flat pharyngeal molars to grind
plant matter, or a powerful pharyngeal bite
to crush shelled prey. Fortunately some fishes can change
their secondary teeth to match a new diet over several years. This flexibility allows fish to adapt and find food in a huge variety
of aquatic environments. Some pharyngeal jaws have formed
to eat food too hard for most fishes. California Sheephead use pointed teeth
from their oral jaws to pry urchins off rocks before crushing
their spiny exteriors in strong pharyngeal jaws that have fused
with the bones of their skulls. Other fish prioritize eating
huge quantities of food. The pharyngeal jaws of grass carp
have two bone components that move in unison to pull plant life
into their stomachs, consuming over 18 kilograms
of seaweed a day. Other pharyngeal jaws are adapted
to suit incredibly specific circumstances. Consider this species of pearlfish that
lives inside sea cucumbers and feeds on their guts. Fish are the most diverse group
of vertebrates with over 30,000 unique species, and much of that diversity is due
to the hundreds of unique jaws separating otherwise identical species. Perhaps the best example of this
dental diversity can be seen in cichlids. This family of fish is primarily found in
select African and South American lakes. Typically, large lakes like these
would be occupied by a handful of distantly related species, each adapted to consume one
of the lake's limited food sources. But here, almost every corner
of the ecosystem is occupied by a different species
of cichlid. There are over 1,700 cichlid species, many almost identical save
for their uniquely adapted jaws which have evolved to eat crustaceans,
mollusks, worms, algae, plankton, and even the scales of other fish. These oral adaptations are so essential
for survival, that different species use their
pharyngeal jaws to make unique mating sounds that allow female cichlids to identify
males of their own species. This technique limits
interspecies breeding, and ensures the parent fish will
pass on their specialized jaws. Scientists are still discovering
all the ways this incredible skeletal mechanism
functions. But given what we know already,
it's fair to say that for most fish, two jaws are better than one.

**Transcript**:
If you look closely at this pack of
riders in the Tour de France, you'll see some of the best cyclists in the world.
They're here in the back. They're keeping up but also resting while their teammates in the front do most of the work. It's a technique called drafting
and it's what helps them survive the three-week race around France. But
drafting only really makes a difference on these parts of the route: the long
flat and hilly stages. Eventually these riders reach stages where they won't be
able to rely on others. They have to rely on their own strength and endurance to
win the race. That happens here on the climbs. They're the most brutal and
exciting parts of the race and they're what makes the Tour de France the most
famous bike ride in the world... The Tour de France began as a desperate
ploy to sell more copies of the sports newspaper, L'Auto. The paper was
struggling, so 1903 its editor, Henri Desgranges organized a 19 day, 2,400
kilometer bike race around the country. It went on to become such a success that
L'Auto made it an annual event. Year after year they added new routes to make the
tour more challenging and also more interesting for people to follow. By 1908,
L'Auto's sales had more than doubled. Then in 1910, one of Desgranges' writers,
Alphonse Steines, suggested adding a new twist to the route: the Tourmalet. It was a
brutal 19 kilometer uphill climb ascending 1400 meters to the
summit. To see if this was even possible Steines jumped in his car to make the
climb. He drove up, but his car got stuck in the snow at the top,
he suffered from hypothermia and nearly died. But nonetheless he sent a telegram
saying: Tourmalet crossed. Very good road. perfectly passable. So the Tourmalet made its debut in the 1910 Tour. French cyclist Octave Lapize was the first to
make the climb successfully. But he had to walk up some parts and famously
called officials assassins when he reached the summit. But he went on to win the whole tour and his statue was placed at the top of the Tourmalet. Since then,
climbs became a staple of the Tour de France. This year the route is made up of
21 stages over 23 days. It features 30 major climbs; seven of them are in the
tour's most difficult category. Including the Tourmalet, which is part of
the event for the 86th time. More than any other climb in the Tour's history.
These climbs are where the tour is ultimately won or lost. These are the
long, flat, and hilly stages that are usually about 200 kilometers long.
Here cyclists ride together in a formation, called a peloton. It allows
cyclists to save energy by sitting behind another rider or drafting. At high
speeds, riders use most of their energy to pedal against wind resistance. But
when a rider stays close behind another, they're sheltered from much of that. So,
pedaling becomes much easier and they can keep up with the front riders. The
way to measure this is to look at how much power a cyclist generates. Here at
the front of the peloton, a Tour de France rider will generate at least 300
watts of power. I jumped on a bike to see what that feels like and just two
kilometers holding 300 watts was really really hard. By comparison when a rider
is behind the lead in the peloton, they only need to generate about 240 watts to
move at the same speed. Holding 240 watts for two kilometers felt remarkably
easier. So even though these two might finish a 200 kilometer flat stage at the
same time, one is going to be way less tired than the other. That's why you see
some of the tour's best riders here in the back. They're drafting up their
teammates whose job it is to do the hard work now so that the team's best cyclist
is rested for the most difficult part; the mountains. Where they'll have to be
on their own. When the peloton starts pedaling uphill,
it slows down. At this stage the race is less about fighting wind resistance and
more about gravity, which affects all riders the same way in the peloton. So,
now every rider in the front and the back needs to generate an extraordinary
amount of power to keep up pace. In 2010 for instance, Danish cyclist Chris Anker
Sorensen made it to the front of the pack on the Tourmalet climb. "Look at the
face on Chris Anker Sorenesen. Dishing out the pain at the front end. As the lead, he
dictated the pace of the whole group. This chart shows his power output on the
final climb. He averaged 415 watts for more than 11 minutes. "...face of Chris Anker Sorensen now, really dishing out the pain. And around here he peaked at an
incredible 590 watts. "magnificent riding by Chris Anker Sorenson, but how long can he keep this up? "Now look at American cyclist Chris Horner. Even though he was several
positions behind Sorenson, his power output was almost the same. The faster
Sorenson climbed, the harder it was for the rest of the peloton to keep up. And
so the formation started to break up as weaker riders fell behind. This is the
moment in the race when the tour's best riders switch from drafting to relying
on their own strength to get ahead. Andy Schleck has finally attacked and Alberto Contador has gone with him. The race is breaking up behind them like two of the best riders here: Luxembourgian Andy Schleck and Spaniard Alberto Contador, who were coasting in the back of the peloton during the long flat
stages. But here they are halfway up the Tourmalet, breaking away for the win. each likely generating well over 400 watts for the final eight kilometers. Contador
in the yellow jersey, was the overall Tour de France leader but only by eight
seconds. In second place was Schleck, who would try and lose him on this climb. "Andy Schleck is riding like a man possessed" It was neck-and-neck to the very top... It's Schleck on the right. Contador! Schleck wins! Contador takes second! Schleck edged Contador by a hair at the top of the Tourmalet to win the stage. But since he didn't lose him,
Contador kept his overall lead and went on to win the Tour de France. This kind
of drama is only possible in the mountains and this year's route makes
climbs particularly important. This year's Tour is being called the highest in history because of how many climbs there are over the course of three weeks.
Just one day features seven climbs. Even after more than two weeks in the race,
riders climb to 2,770 meters above sea level where the thin air makes climbing even harder. That's what makes the Tour
de France the most grueling and prestigious race in this sport. The
winner isn't simply the strongest rider but the one who endures the most pain
and ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the duration of the modern Tour de France, while the generated MCQs do not explicitly ask about the duration. However, Question 5 mentions the power output required for a Tour de France rider to maintain a high speed at the front of the peloton for a certain duration (two kilometers).

Although not a direct match, I would suggest that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it indirectly relates to the duration of the Tour de France by mentioning the energy expenditure of riders over a certain period. Nevertheless, it does not directly answer the question about the duration of the modern Tour de France.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5. However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs accurately match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the duration of the modern Tour de France would be a better match.

To create a more accurate match, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that directly asks about the duration of the modern Tour de France, such as:

Question: How long does the modern Tour de France typically last?
Options: A. 2 weeks, B. 3 weeks, C. 4 weeks, D. 6 weeks

This new generated MCQ would be a more accurate match for the ground truth MCQ.

the front of the peloton, a Tour de France rider will generate at least 300
watts of power. I jumped on a bike to see what that feels like and just two
kilometers holding 300 watts was really really hard. By comparison when a rider
is behind the lead in the peloton, they only need to generate about 240 watts to
move at the same speed. Holding 240 watts for two kilometers felt remarkably
easier. So even though these two might finish a 200 kilometer flat stage at the
same time, one is going to be way less tired than the other. That's why you see
some of the tour's best riders here in the back. They're drafting up their
teammates whose job it is to do the hard work now so that the team's best cyclist
is rested for the most difficult part; the mountains. Where they'll have to be
on their own. When the peloton starts pedaling uphill,
it slows down. At this stage the race is less about fighting wind resistance and
more about gravity, which affects all riders the same way in the peloton. So,
now every rider in the front and the back needs to generate an extraordinary
amount of power to keep up pace. In 2010 for instance, Danish cyclist Chris Anker
Sorensen made it to the front of the pack on the Tourmalet climb. "Look at the
face on Chris Anker Sorenesen. Dishing out the pain at the front end. As the lead, he
dictated the pace of the whole group. This chart shows his power output on the
final climb. He averaged 415 watts for more than 11 minutes. "...face of Chris Anker Sorensen now, really dishing out the pain. And around here he peaked at an
incredible 590 watts. "magnificent riding by Chris Anker Sorenson, but how long can he keep this up? "Now look at American cyclist Chris Horner. Even though he was several
positions behind Sorenson, his power output was almost the same. The faster
Sorenson climbed, the harder it was for the rest of the peloton to keep up. And
so the formation started to break up as weaker riders fell behind. This is the
moment in the race when the tour's best riders switch from drafting to relying
on their own strength to get ahead. Andy Schleck has finally attacked and Alberto Contador has gone with him. The race is breaking up behind them like two of the best riders here: Luxembourgian Andy Schleck and Spaniard Alberto Contador, who were coasting in the back of the peloton during the long flat
stages. But here they are halfway up the Tourmalet, breaking away for the win. each likely generating well over 400 watts for the final eight kilometers. Contador
in the yellow jersey, was the overall Tour de France leader but only by eight
seconds. In second place was Schleck, who would try and lose him on this climb. "Andy Schleck is riding like a man possessed" It was neck-and-neck to the very top... It's Schleck on the right. Contador! Schleck wins! Contador takes second! Schleck edged Contador by a hair at the top of the Tourmalet to win the stage. But since he didn't lose him,
Contador kept his overall lead and went on to win the Tour de France. This kind
of drama is only possible in the mountains and this year's route makes
climbs particularly important. This year's Tour is being called the highest in history because of how many climbs there are over the course of three weeks.
Just one day features seven climbs. Even after more than two weeks in the race,
riders climb to 2,770 meters above sea level where the thin air makes climbing even harder. That's what makes the Tour
de France the most grueling and prestigious race in this sport. The
winner isn't simply the strongest rider but the one who endures the most pain
and ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains.

**Transcript**:
You and your best friend Bill are 
the greatest bards in the kingdom— but maybe not the brightest. The hit song you performed 
at last night’s fair insulted the king, and now your hours are numbered. Just before your execution, you’re approached by the princess,
who happens to be a big fan. She slips you a pouch containing
two magic, six-sided dice that can land any way you wish. You have no idea how this could possibly
help, but you thank her anyways. As everything goes dark, you both suddenly find yourself standing 
in a deep cavern before a robed figure. It turns out that Death is a connoisseur
of most excellent music. He’s decided to give you a chance 
to escape your fate by beating him at his favorite game: 
life-sized Snakes and Ladders. The cavern has 100 rooms connected 
by passageways as well as— you guessed it—
snakes and ladders. Each turn one of you will roll a die, 
then advance that many rooms. Ending your move at the bottom 
of a ladder means moving up to the top, while ending on a snake’s head
will make you slide down to its tail. Each of you must make your way
through the cavern and reach the exit in fewer turns
than Death himself. Before you can think twice,
your host starts casting his die, and within 6 rolls he’s reached 
the cavern entrance. “Better get moving,” he says. “Oh, and by the way, once one 
of you uses a snake or ladder, it’ll disappear and be inaccessible
to the other.” You have no idea how you can possibly
get lucky enough to win, but then you remember your magic dice. Can you figure out a sequence of rolls
that will get both of you to the exit in 5 or fewer moves each? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The cavern contains many
routes to the exit, and it’s natural to gravitate 
to the ladders that allow you to cover a lot of ground, 
quickly. Like this one— on turn 2 you’d be at 75, but without any further ladder boosts,
you’d need another 5 rolls to get out. Or this one— three ladders get you to 82, but then it would take another 4 rolls
to get around the pesky snake at 88. In fact, there’s no path
that can get you to the exit in 5 moves using exclusively ladders. So where does that leave you? Snakes. It’s counterintuitive to make
moves that take you farther away from your target, but snakes open up a surprising amount 
of opportunities. For instance, these three ladders would
put you a single roll from the exit, but cost too many turns
to reach by ladders. These two are, however, only 5 and 12
rooms from snake tails, respectively. So could you work backwards from those
to find a 5 roll path? There are exactly two 5-turn routes
you might find using these ladders: Ladder snake snake ladder exit, and ladder ladder snake ladder exit. So that’s it, right? 
Unfortunately, no— the two paths share a snake and a ladder, each of which will be unusable after 
the first of you slides and then climbs. You won’t find 5-turn
moves anywhere else, so is one of you doomed? There’s one more possibility to consider: the disappearing ladders and snakes
can impede your progress, but could they also help it? There are two paths to the 94 ladder
that almost work, except for this snake, at exactly the midpoint 
between the two ladders. If Bill were to take that snake 
on his route, you could then get past it 
and up to the exit in just 5 moves. And good news— 
whichever path you choose, one of the 5-roll paths we found
earlier does exactly that without using any 
of your snakes or ladders. So all you need is for Bill to go first
and stick to the plan. You and Bill both reach 
the cavern entrance and climb back into the public square,
to everyone’s surprise. Before the guards can seize you again, you wow the crowd— and king— with a song
about your epic contest with Death.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I identified the most similar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of die rolls needed for the quickest way to the top, given a magical die that can roll any number from 1 to 7. However, the transcript does not mention a die that can roll from 1 to 7; instead, it mentions a standard six-sided die.

Considering the context and the questions provided, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: "What is the main challenge in finding a 5-turn route to the exit?" While it does not directly ask about the number of die rolls, it is related to the challenge of finding a quick path to the exit, which is the underlying theme of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the number of die rolls, I would choose Question 8: "What is the key to finding a 5-turn route to the exit?" This question is still not directly related to the number of die rolls, but it is closer to the theme of finding a quick path to the exit.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ based on the question intent and content. In this case, I would recommend Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the shortest snake on the board, while the generated MCQs cover various aspects of the story and game, but not this specific detail.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would select Question 4: "What happens when a player lands on a snake's head in the game?" This question is related to snakes in the game, but it does not ask about the length of a snake.

Since there is no direct match, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ. If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

**Transcript**:
You and your best friend Bill are 
the greatest bards in the kingdom— but maybe not the brightest. The hit song you performed 
at last night’s fair insulted the king, and now your hours are numbered. Just before your execution, you’re approached by the princess,
who happens to be a big fan. She slips you a pouch containing
two magic, six-sided dice that can land any way you wish. You have no idea how this could possibly
help, but you thank her anyways. As everything goes dark, you both suddenly find yourself standing 
in a deep cavern before a robed figure. It turns out that Death is a connoisseur
of most excellent music. He’s decided to give you a chance 
to escape your fate by beating him at his favorite game: 
life-sized Snakes and Ladders. The cavern has 100 rooms connected 
by passageways as well as— you guessed it—
snakes and ladders. Each turn one of you will roll a die, 
then advance that many rooms. Ending your move at the bottom 
of a ladder means moving up to the top, while ending on a snake’s head
will make you slide down to its tail. Each of you must make your way
through the cavern and reach the exit in fewer turns
than Death himself. Before you can think twice,
your host starts casting his die, and within 6 rolls he’s reached 
the cavern entrance. “Better get moving,” he says. “Oh, and by the way, once one 
of you uses a snake or ladder, it’ll disappear and be inaccessible
to the other.” You have no idea how you can possibly
get lucky enough to win, but then you remember your magic dice. Can you figure out a sequence of rolls
that will get both of you to the exit in 5 or fewer moves each? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The cavern contains many
routes to the exit, and it’s natural to gravitate 
to the ladders that allow you to cover a lot of ground, 
quickly. Like this one— on turn 2 you’d be at 75, but without any further ladder boosts,
you’d need another 5 rolls to get out. Or this one— three ladders get you to 82, but then it would take another 4 rolls
to get around the pesky snake at 88. In fact, there’s no path
that can get you to the exit in 5 moves using exclusively ladders. So where does that leave you? Snakes. It’s counterintuitive to make
moves that take you farther away from your target, but snakes open up a surprising amount 
of opportunities. For instance, these three ladders would
put you a single roll from the exit, but cost too many turns
to reach by ladders. These two are, however, only 5 and 12
rooms from snake tails, respectively. So could you work backwards from those
to find a 5 roll path? There are exactly two 5-turn routes
you might find using these ladders: Ladder snake snake ladder exit, and ladder ladder snake ladder exit. So that’s it, right? 
Unfortunately, no— the two paths share a snake and a ladder, each of which will be unusable after 
the first of you slides and then climbs. You won’t find 5-turn
moves anywhere else, so is one of you doomed? There’s one more possibility to consider: the disappearing ladders and snakes
can impede your progress, but could they also help it? There are two paths to the 94 ladder
that almost work, except for this snake, at exactly the midpoint 
between the two ladders. If Bill were to take that snake 
on his route, you could then get past it 
and up to the exit in just 5 moves. And good news— 
whichever path you choose, one of the 5-roll paths we found
earlier does exactly that without using any 
of your snakes or ladders. So all you need is for Bill to go first
and stick to the plan. You and Bill both reach 
the cavern entrance and climb back into the public square,
to everyone’s surprise. Before the guards can seize you again, you wow the crowd— and king— with a song
about your epic contest with Death.

**Transcript**:
In 1864, French zoologist August Duméril was baffled while investigating 
the axolotl. Unlike many other amphibians,
which transform into terrestrial adults, axolotls retain their juvenile
characteristics and never leave the water. In an attempt to induce metamorphosis, Duméril spent months removing their gills. But in most instances, the axolotls
simply... grew them back. Indeed, axolotls are masters
of regeneration: they can flawlessly regenerate body parts ranging from amputated limbs and crushed 
spines to parts of their eyes and brains. So how do they do it? 
And what other secrets are they keeping? This extraordinary salamander is native
to the wetlands in Mexico City. Ancient Aztec people considered it 
the incarnation of a God named Xolotl— hence the axolotl’s name, 
roughly meaning “water monster.” Axolotls reach sexual maturity with gills 
and a tadpole-like dorsal fin. Scientists think their forever-young 
condition, called “neoteny,” evolved because of their stable habitat. For salamanders that develop in waters
that dry up, efficiently transitioning to land 
is essential. But the lakes axolotls evolved 
in were unchanging year-round and didn't host many aquatic predators. So, scientists think it was advantageous
for axolotls to forgo the demands of metamorphosis. However,
they haven’t completely lost this ability. If exposed to certain substances,
axolotls will turn into adults. But they’ll often experience
shorter lifespans and lose some of their self-healing 
abilities. These regenerative talents may seem like
crazy superpowers to begin with, but axolotls have good use for them. As babies, they’re in direct competition. So, they snack on each other. This is usually not a huge problem 
thanks to how quickly they can regenerate body parts. When an axolotl loses a limb, tissues
stimulate growth in the area. Skin cells divide and cover the wound. Then, progenitor cells, which can develop
into various bodily tissues, form a mass at the site of injury and nearby nerves secrete 
growth-promoting proteins. Over the next few weeks, 
a new limb emerges as cells proliferate and differentiate 
in coordination. This process could potentially lead to
uncontrolled growth and tumor formation. But axolotls are remarkably
resistant to cancer. They have a system in place that tightly
controls cellular proliferation. To better understand the axolotl’s 
baffling biology, scientists sequenced its genome. They found it to be more than ten times
longer than a human’s. Mutations can change the length
of any animal’s genome. For whatever reason, salamanders have
much more DNA than other vertebrates because they lose parts
of it less frequently. Investigating the axolotl’s genome,
scientists saw many repeated sequences, most of which don't code for proteins
and have no known function. They also found genes 
that are key in regeneration. However, the biggest factor that sets
axolotl regeneration apart may not be a set of unique genes, 
but how they regulate their genes. It’s no wonder that axolotls are one
of science’s most studied animals. But their population in the wild 
has plummeted. Hundreds of years ago, axolotls thrived
under the Aztec capital. Within the surrounding lakes, Aztec people built islands called
chinampas for growing crops. This highly productive form of agriculture
created a vast system of canals, expanding the lake system’s 
shallow, sheltered habitat— the axolotls’ ideal environment. But when Spanish invaders arrived,
they began draining the lakes. And even more water has been
diverted in recent years. Today, the entire population of wild
axolotls is found in just one place, Lake Xochimilco, where it’s threatened
by pollution and invasive fishes. People are working to regenerate
the ecosystem and strengthen the 2,000 year old 
chinampa farming tradition. If interest grows, farmers could recover
abandoned chinampas and support the local community—
along with the axolotl. Eventually, the benefits of saving 
this salamander might be even greater. Scientists hope that one day
we’ll be able to apply the axolotl’s masterful tumor suppression
and regenerative abilities to the human body. Perhaps its secrets are the real reason 
for the slimy god monster’s smile.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ. However, the closest match in terms of question intent is Question 7's option B, which mentions that axolotls that go through metamorphosis often lose some of their self-healing abilities, and this is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address the life span of axolotls after metamorphosis.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall content, I would choose Question 6, as it talks about how axolotls prevent uncontrolled growth and tumor formation, which is somewhat related to the consequences of axolotls going through metamorphosis.

**Transcript**:
In 1864, French zoologist August Duméril was baffled while investigating 
the axolotl. Unlike many other amphibians,
which transform into terrestrial adults, axolotls retain their juvenile
characteristics and never leave the water. In an attempt to induce metamorphosis, Duméril spent months removing their gills. But in most instances, the axolotls
simply... grew them back. Indeed, axolotls are masters
of regeneration: they can flawlessly regenerate body parts ranging from amputated limbs and crushed 
spines to parts of their eyes and brains. So how do they do it? 
And what other secrets are they keeping? This extraordinary salamander is native
to the wetlands in Mexico City. Ancient Aztec people considered it 
the incarnation of a God named Xolotl— hence the axolotl’s name, 
roughly meaning “water monster.” Axolotls reach sexual maturity with gills 
and a tadpole-like dorsal fin. Scientists think their forever-young 
condition, called “neoteny,” evolved because of their stable habitat. For salamanders that develop in waters
that dry up, efficiently transitioning to land 
is essential. But the lakes axolotls evolved 
in were unchanging year-round and didn't host many aquatic predators. So, scientists think it was advantageous
for axolotls to forgo the demands of metamorphosis. However,
they haven’t completely lost this ability. If exposed to certain substances,
axolotls will turn into adults. But they’ll often experience
shorter lifespans and lose some of their self-healing 
abilities. These regenerative talents may seem like
crazy superpowers to begin with, but axolotls have good use for them. As babies, they’re in direct competition. So, they snack on each other. This is usually not a huge problem 
thanks to how quickly they can regenerate body parts. When an axolotl loses a limb, tissues
stimulate growth in the area. Skin cells divide and cover the wound. Then, progenitor cells, which can develop
into various bodily tissues, form a mass at the site of injury and nearby nerves secrete 
growth-promoting proteins. Over the next few weeks, 
a new limb emerges as cells proliferate and differentiate 
in coordination. This process could potentially lead to
uncontrolled growth and tumor formation. But axolotls are remarkably
resistant to cancer. They have a system in place that tightly
controls cellular proliferation. To better understand the axolotl’s 
baffling biology, scientists sequenced its genome. They found it to be more than ten times
longer than a human’s. Mutations can change the length
of any animal’s genome. For whatever reason, salamanders have
much more DNA than other vertebrates because they lose parts
of it less frequently. Investigating the axolotl’s genome,
scientists saw many repeated sequences, most of which don't code for proteins
and have no known function. They also found genes 
that are key in regeneration. However, the biggest factor that sets
axolotl regeneration apart may not be a set of unique genes, 
but how they regulate their genes. It’s no wonder that axolotls are one
of science’s most studied animals. But their population in the wild 
has plummeted. Hundreds of years ago, axolotls thrived
under the Aztec capital. Within the surrounding lakes, Aztec people built islands called
chinampas for growing crops. This highly productive form of agriculture
created a vast system of canals, expanding the lake system’s 
shallow, sheltered habitat— the axolotls’ ideal environment. But when Spanish invaders arrived,
they began draining the lakes. And even more water has been
diverted in recent years. Today, the entire population of wild
axolotls is found in just one place, Lake Xochimilco, where it’s threatened
by pollution and invasive fishes. People are working to regenerate
the ecosystem and strengthen the 2,000 year old 
chinampa farming tradition. If interest grows, farmers could recover
abandoned chinampas and support the local community—
along with the axolotl. Eventually, the benefits of saving 
this salamander might be even greater. Scientists hope that one day
we’ll be able to apply the axolotl’s masterful tumor suppression
and regenerative abilities to the human body. Perhaps its secrets are the real reason 
for the slimy god monster’s smile.

**Transcript**:
In August 1947, India gained independence
after 200 years of British rule. What followed was one of the largest and
bloodiest forced migrations in history. An estimated one million people 
lost their lives. Before British colonization, the Indian subcontinent was a patchwork 
of regional kingdoms known as princely states populated 
by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, and Jews. Each princely state had 
its own traditions, caste backgrounds, and leadership. Starting in the 1500s, a series 
of European powers colonized India with coastal trading settlements. By the mid-18th century, 
the English East India Company emerged as the primary colonial power 
in India. The British ruled some provinces directly,
and ruled the princely states indirectly. Under indirect rule, the princely states
remained sovereign but made political and financial 
concessions to the British. In the 19th century, the British began to 
categorize Indians by religious identity— a gross simplification 
of the communities in India. They counted Hindus as “majorities” and all other religious communities 
as distinct “minorities,” with Muslims being the largest minority. Sikhs were considered part of the Hindu
community by everyone but themselves. In elections, people could only vote 
for candidates of their own religious identification. These practices exaggerated differences, sowing distrust between communities
that had previously co-existed. The 20th century began with decades 
of anti-colonial movements, where Indians fought for independence
from Britain. In the aftermath of World War II, under enormous financial strain 
from the war, Britain finally caved. Indian political leaders had 
differing views on what an independent India 
should look like. Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru
represented the Hindu majority and wanted one united India. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, 
who led the Muslim minority, thought the rifts created by colonization
were too deep to repair. Jinnah argued for a two nation division where Muslims would have a homeland 
called Pakistan. Following riots in 1946 and 1947,
the British expedited their retreat, planning Indian independence
behind closed doors. In June 1947, the British viceroy
announced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned
into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how
exactly this would happen. Using outdated maps, inaccurate census
numbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks,
the Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces 
under direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam. The border took into account where 
Hindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location
and population percentages. So if a Hindu majority area bordered
another Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered
Muslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan. Princely states on the border had to
choose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process. While the Boundary Committee worked 
on the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part 
of the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure. Families divided themselves. Fearing sexual violence, parents sent 
young daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe. The new map wasn’t revealed 
until August 17th, 1947— two days after independence. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated 
East and West Pakistan. The rest became Hindu-majority India. In a period of two years, millions 
of Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India 
fled villages where their families had lived
for centuries. The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, 
Dhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents 
and filled with refugees. In the power vacuum British forces
left behind, radicalized militias and local groups 
massacred migrants. Much of the violence occurred in Punjab,
and women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation. Around 100,000 women were kidnapped 
and forced to marry their captors. The problems created by Partition went far
beyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves 
became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became
the new country of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir
decided to join India— a decision that was to be finalized
by a public referendum of the majority Muslim population. That referendum still hasn't
happened as of 2020, and India and Pakistan have been warring
over Kashmir since 1947. More than 70 years later, the legacies of the Partition remain 
clear in the subcontinent: in its new political formations and 
in the memories of divided families.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially relates to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the communities that are citizens of India and Pakistan, with options including Hindus, Muslims, Christians, and all of the above. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the citizenship of various communities in India and Pakistan, Question 3 mentions the existence of various communities (Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, and Jews) in the Indian subcontinent before British colonization.

Although Question 3 does not directly address the citizenship aspect, it does provide information about the diverse communities present in the region. Therefore, I would suggest Question 3 as the most similar generated MCQ, albeit with a partial match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that this is a partial match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly addresses the citizenship of various communities in India and Pakistan.

**Transcript**:
In August 1947, India gained independence
after 200 years of British rule. What followed was one of the largest and
bloodiest forced migrations in history. An estimated one million people 
lost their lives. Before British colonization, the Indian subcontinent was a patchwork 
of regional kingdoms known as princely states populated 
by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, and Jews. Each princely state had 
its own traditions, caste backgrounds, and leadership. Starting in the 1500s, a series 
of European powers colonized India with coastal trading settlements. By the mid-18th century, 
the English East India Company emerged as the primary colonial power 
in India. The British ruled some provinces directly,
and ruled the princely states indirectly. Under indirect rule, the princely states
remained sovereign but made political and financial 
concessions to the British. In the 19th century, the British began to 
categorize Indians by religious identity— a gross simplification 
of the communities in India. They counted Hindus as “majorities” and all other religious communities 
as distinct “minorities,” with Muslims being the largest minority. Sikhs were considered part of the Hindu
community by everyone but themselves. In elections, people could only vote 
for candidates of their own religious identification. These practices exaggerated differences, sowing distrust between communities
that had previously co-existed. The 20th century began with decades 
of anti-colonial movements, where Indians fought for independence
from Britain. In the aftermath of World War II, under enormous financial strain 
from the war, Britain finally caved. Indian political leaders had 
differing views on what an independent India 
should look like. Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru
represented the Hindu majority and wanted one united India. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, 
who led the Muslim minority, thought the rifts created by colonization
were too deep to repair. Jinnah argued for a two nation division where Muslims would have a homeland 
called Pakistan. Following riots in 1946 and 1947,
the British expedited their retreat, planning Indian independence
behind closed doors. In June 1947, the British viceroy
announced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned
into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how
exactly this would happen. Using outdated maps, inaccurate census
numbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks,
the Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces 
under direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam. The border took into account where 
Hindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location
and population percentages. So if a Hindu majority area bordered
another Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered
Muslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan. Princely states on the border had to
choose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process. While the Boundary Committee worked 
on the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part 
of the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure. Families divided themselves. Fearing sexual violence, parents sent 
young daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe. The new map wasn’t revealed 
until August 17th, 1947— two days after independence. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated 
East and West Pakistan. The rest became Hindu-majority India. In a period of two years, millions 
of Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India 
fled villages where their families had lived
for centuries. The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, 
Dhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents 
and filled with refugees. In the power vacuum British forces
left behind, radicalized militias and local groups 
massacred migrants. Much of the violence occurred in Punjab,
and women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation. Around 100,000 women were kidnapped 
and forced to marry their captors. The problems created by Partition went far
beyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves 
became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became
the new country of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir
decided to join India— a decision that was to be finalized
by a public referendum of the majority Muslim population. That referendum still hasn't
happened as of 2020, and India and Pakistan have been warring
over Kashmir since 1947. More than 70 years later, the legacies of the Partition remain 
clear in the subcontinent: in its new political formations and 
in the memories of divided families.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the key impact of the Partition of 1947, and the correct option is "All of the above" (Divided Families, Violence, Refugee crisis). While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the key impact of the Partition, Question 5 partially matches the intent by asking about the effect of the British categorization of Indians by religious identity, which is related to the Partition.

However, a closer match can be found in the generated MCQs that describe the consequences of the Partition. Questions 2, 8, and 9 describe specific consequences, such as the estimated number of people who lost their lives, the loss of sovereignty by princely states, and the estimated number of women who were kidnapped and forced to marry their captors.

Considering the options and content, I would suggest that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it describes a specific consequence of the Partition (violence against women) that is related to the key impact mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9

Please note that this match is not exact, and the generated MCQs do not fully capture the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

were too deep to repair. Jinnah argued for a two nation division where Muslims would have a homeland 
called Pakistan. Following riots in 1946 and 1947,
the British expedited their retreat, planning Indian independence
behind closed doors. In June 1947, the British viceroy
announced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned
into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how
exactly this would happen. Using outdated maps, inaccurate census
numbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks,
the Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces 
under direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam. The border took into account where 
Hindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location
and population percentages. So if a Hindu majority area bordered
another Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered
Muslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan. Princely states on the border had to
choose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process. While the Boundary Committee worked 
on the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part 
of the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure. Families divided themselves. Fearing sexual violence, parents sent 
young daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe. The new map wasn’t revealed 
until August 17th, 1947— two days after independence. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated 
East and West Pakistan. The rest became Hindu-majority India. In a period of two years, millions 
of Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India 
fled villages where their families had lived
for centuries. The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, 
Dhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents 
and filled with refugees. In the power vacuum British forces
left behind, radicalized militias and local groups 
massacred migrants. Much of the violence occurred in Punjab,
and women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation. Around 100,000 women were kidnapped 
and forced to marry their captors. The problems created by Partition went far
beyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves 
became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became
the new country of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir
decided to join India— a decision that was to be finalized
by a public referendum of the majority Muslim population. That referendum still hasn't
happened as of 2020, and India and Pakistan have been warring
over Kashmir since 1947. More than 70 years later, the legacies of the Partition remain 
clear in the subcontinent: in its new political formations and 
in the memories of divided families.

**Transcript**:
On sunny days, 
the Roman citizens of Ostia could be found on a long stone bench
near the Forum. Friends and neighbors exchanged 
news and gossip while simultaneously attending
to more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit
up to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the
restroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone,
our shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions 
in the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts 
contain instructions for keeping waste away
from drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar
shape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had
clay structures made for squatting or sitting 
in the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used
running water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished 
in the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected
to a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered
a manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain 
what inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management
is essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground
for dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera,
dysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before
scientists fully understood the relationship between
sewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have
recorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex 
sanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously 
flowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste 
outside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period 
also had private and public toilets, except their waste 
was immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors
gathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste 
management continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation 
into the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs” 
became commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently
dumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows
into communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers 
would load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits 
to dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach
persisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent
some major changes. By the late Middle Ages, 
most wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled
by the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring 
the king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship 
with the monarch made him a surprisingly
influential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology
came in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed 
the first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water 
and a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention 
stank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775, 
Scottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe 
to retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved
into the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates 
the inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed 
modern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range
of features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t 
have their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion 
don’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities 
at risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need 
to invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial, 
and political issues that produce inequity 
throughout the sanitation pipeline.

a manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain 
what inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management
is essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground
for dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera,
dysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before
scientists fully understood the relationship between
sewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have
recorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex 
sanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously 
flowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste 
outside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period 
also had private and public toilets, except their waste 
was immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors
gathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste 
management continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation 
into the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs” 
became commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently
dumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows
into communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers 
would load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits 
to dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach
persisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent
some major changes. By the late Middle Ages, 
most wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled
by the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring 
the king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship 
with the monarch made him a surprisingly
influential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology
came in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed 
the first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water 
and a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention 
stank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775, 
Scottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe 
to retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved
into the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates 
the inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed 
modern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range
of features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t 
have their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion 
don’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities 
at risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need 
to invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial, 
and political issues that produce inequity 
throughout the sanitation pipeline.

**Transcript**:
On sunny days, 
the Roman citizens of Ostia could be found on a long stone bench
near the Forum. Friends and neighbors exchanged 
news and gossip while simultaneously attending
to more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit
up to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the
restroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone,
our shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions 
in the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts 
contain instructions for keeping waste away
from drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar
shape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had
clay structures made for squatting or sitting 
in the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used
running water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished 
in the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected
to a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered
a manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain 
what inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management
is essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground

**Transcript**:
In the coastal waters of the Bahamas, a young lemon shark is on the run
from a surprising predator: an adult shark of her own species. Half of her 17 siblings have already
been eaten by the older generation, and it looks as though 
she’s about to join them. But just as the predator closes in, she disappears into a thicket
of underwater roots, safe in the refuge of the mangrove forest. Forests don’t usually come to mind
as a habitat for sharks. But various marine forests cover roughly 
4.2 million square kilometers of the planet, providing food and shelter
for 35% of the world’s sharks. Deadly tiger sharks
blend into seagrass meadows before pouncing on sea cows 
and sea turtles. White sharks hunt down seals in forests
of kelp towering 65 meters tall. And lemon sharks stalk
forests of mangroves— the only trees on Earth 
that live in the ocean. All these ecosystems have their quirks, but mangroves may be the most unique 
of all. Harboring life between their roots
and among their crowns, mangroves function as an essential bridge
between land and sea. And to survive between these worlds,
different mangrove species have evolved various adaptations that 
protect them and their resident sharks. Taking root in the unstable ground 
of muddy coastal regions is difficult, so mangrove seedlings germinate 
attached to their mother plant. Once they've grown large enough
to survive on their own, these partially developed plants begin 
to ride the current. Most take root nearby, 
while some travel for several months before landing in a different part 
of the world. Once they’ve settled down,
mangroves deploy tall, skinny stilt roots, crutch-like prop roots 
or wavy buttress roots, to support themselves 
in their unsteady terrain. These newly established mangroves have 
to contend with two additional problems: seawater is high in dehydrating
and potentially toxic salt, and the mud contains little to no oxygen. This combination would be
lethal to most trees, but mangroves make the most 
of their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots 
are largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these
roots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create 
a waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen 
through the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use 
incredibly fine filters in their roots. Others concentrate salt 
inside special cellular compartments, bark or dying leaves, that then drop off. Some species can even excrete 
the excess minerals through specially adapted salt glands. All these processes make mangroves
more than a little salty, but that doesn’t deter coastal life 
from living in their nooks and crannies. While birds nest among mangrove branches, fish lay eggs amidst 
their sprawling, complex root systems. Symbiotic sponges and sea squirts 
protect their host trees from hungry woodboring crustaceans. Crabs, snails, and shrimp 
eat algae, mussels, barnacles, and salty mangrove detritus. These animals in turn feed fish, which are devoured by shark pups 
roaming the roots— alongside occasional
vegetarian meals of seagrass. But sharks aren’t just the beneficiaries
of marine forests, they’re part of the glue 
that holds them together. Sharks limit the abundance of animals which would otherwise overgraze 
these essential plants. Just as marine forests provide shelter 
to vulnerable baby predators, those predators grow up
to protect their forest homes. Unfortunately, both sides of this delicate
balance are under threat. Overfishing has decimated 
shark populations worldwide, and many marine forests are being polluted
or cut down for coastal development. This destruction
is especially dangerous because marine forests are one 
of the single most important ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Mangroves and seagrasses trap
carbon between their roots, and fast-growing kelps export vast
amounts of carbon to the deep ocean. Together, marine forests sequester around
310 million tonnes of carbon every year, capturing 3% of our annual
global carbon emissions. So, like the sharks that inhabit them, humans need to fight tooth and nail 
to protect these essential ecosystems.

**Transcript**:
In the coastal waters of the Bahamas, a young lemon shark is on the run
from a surprising predator: an adult shark of her own species. Half of her 17 siblings have already
been eaten by the older generation, and it looks as though 
she’s about to join them. But just as the predator closes in, she disappears into a thicket
of underwater roots, safe in the refuge of the mangrove forest. Forests don’t usually come to mind
as a habitat for sharks. But various marine forests cover roughly 
4.2 million square kilometers of the planet, providing food and shelter
for 35% of the world’s sharks. Deadly tiger sharks
blend into seagrass meadows before pouncing on sea cows 
and sea turtles. White sharks hunt down seals in forests
of kelp towering 65 meters tall. And lemon sharks stalk
forests of mangroves— the only trees on Earth 
that live in the ocean. All these ecosystems have their quirks, but mangroves may be the most unique 
of all. Harboring life between their roots
and among their crowns, mangroves function as an essential bridge
between land and sea. And to survive between these worlds,
different mangrove species have evolved various adaptations that 
protect them and their resident sharks. Taking root in the unstable ground 
of muddy coastal regions is difficult, so mangrove seedlings germinate 
attached to their mother plant. Once they've grown large enough
to survive on their own, these partially developed plants begin 
to ride the current. Most take root nearby, 
while some travel for several months before landing in a different part 
of the world. Once they’ve settled down,
mangroves deploy tall, skinny stilt roots, crutch-like prop roots 
or wavy buttress roots, to support themselves 
in their unsteady terrain. These newly established mangroves have 
to contend with two additional problems: seawater is high in dehydrating
and potentially toxic salt, and the mud contains little to no oxygen. This combination would be
lethal to most trees, but mangroves make the most 
of their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots 
are largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these
roots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create 
a waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen 
through the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use 
incredibly fine filters in their roots. Others concentrate salt 
inside special cellular compartments, bark or dying leaves, that then drop off. Some species can even excrete 
the excess minerals through specially adapted salt glands. All these processes make mangroves
more than a little salty, but that doesn’t deter coastal life 
from living in their nooks and crannies. While birds nest among mangrove branches, fish lay eggs amidst 
their sprawling, complex root systems. Symbiotic sponges and sea squirts 
protect their host trees from hungry woodboring crustaceans. Crabs, snails, and shrimp 
eat algae, mussels, barnacles, and salty mangrove detritus. These animals in turn feed fish, which are devoured by shark pups 
roaming the roots— alongside occasional
vegetarian meals of seagrass. But sharks aren’t just the beneficiaries
of marine forests, they’re part of the glue 
that holds them together. Sharks limit the abundance of animals which would otherwise overgraze 
these essential plants. Just as marine forests provide shelter 
to vulnerable baby predators, those predators grow up
to protect their forest homes. Unfortunately, both sides of this delicate
balance are under threat. Overfishing has decimated 
shark populations worldwide, and many marine forests are being polluted
or cut down for coastal development. This destruction
is especially dangerous because marine forests are one 
of the single most important ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Mangroves and seagrasses trap
carbon between their roots, and fast-growing kelps export vast
amounts of carbon to the deep ocean. Together, marine forests sequester around
310 million tonnes of carbon every year, capturing 3% of our annual
global carbon emissions. So, like the sharks that inhabit them, humans need to fight tooth and nail 
to protect these essential ecosystems.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only addresses one aspect of the problems mangroves face (high salinity of seawater). 

A more suitable match would be a question that addresses all the problems mangroves face, including unstable, muddy ground and lack of oxygen in mud. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose the closest match based on the content, I would choose:

**Question 5: What is a unique feature of mangrove roots that allows them to thrive in low-oxygen environments? Options: A. They are completely buried in the mud., B. They have microscopic pores that take in oxygen during low tide., C. They are incapable of absorbing oxygen., D. They only absorb oxygen through photosynthesis. Correct Option: B**

This question addresses one aspect of the problems mangroves face (lack of oxygen in mud). However, please note that this is not a perfect match.

If I really had to choose an index, I would choose **8** or **5**, with the caveat that neither question perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ.

i'm brad meltzer and i write about heroes for a living but this is without question the most important book that i've ever worked on is the story of anne frank hi i'm anne frank and you're gonna see that this story is about hope the most important things we need in the world today i wrote these books as always to give my kids better heroes to look up to i can't think of anyone or anything to give them better than some hope and we all need it right now i will also see today that i am not reading alone i am reading uh with a friend named saul dreyer hello everybody my name is sal dreyer i'm 95 years old and i'm a holocaust survivor this again is i am anne frank by my favorite author brad meltzer illustrated by the amazing chris hellopolis and this is the story that speaks for itself i am anne frank when i was born my sister loved laughing at my big ears look they're huge i also have big eyes and the cutest smile oh she's adorable look at her ears a sister says as a girl i love the same things many kids love playing hide and seek and tag ice skating and going to the movies i collected autographs and knew the names of every celebrity that's rin tin tin one of the other things i really loved was writing stories this was my teacher hendrika kuperas she was so encouraging wonderful job and one other thing that's important to know about me is that i'm jewish that's my religion i believe in god and in helping to make the world a better place but when i was born in germany there were people knewing as nazi who didn't like those of us who were jewish or other groups who were different from them back then the nazis were run by a terrible leader named adolf hitler who promised to make germany strong again don't buy from jews they say germans unite why are they being so mean they don't even know us he believed that germans were superior and he blamed the jews for all of germany's problems even though we hadn't done anything wrong they protect us from the nazi my family became refugees and moved to a city called amsterdam in the netherlands life was good there for years until may the 10th 1940 when the german came to the netherlands too the nazi that tried to take over the world we need to leave here now it's not safe anymore we tried to leave the netherlands and go to the united states but we couldn't you need to fill out more forms if you want to be an immigrant but my family if we stay here i'm sorry more forms please when the germans arrived in the netherlands they passed new laws here at first jews weren't allowed in public parks beaches pools or in libraries we can't go swimming jews are not wanted here then they said we couldn't go to the movies but i love the movies we don't serve juice here eventually we weren't allowed to ride our own bikes drive our own cars or buy food or certain restaurants i just want to feed my family no jews allowed one of the worst days was when they said we have to leave our school and only be with all the jewish kids i'm sorry teacher says those are the new rules no jews allowed i'll miss you and i'll miss all of you every day it seemed to get worse in april 1942 the nazis made us wear these jewish stars with the dutch word for jew why do we have to wear these whenever we go out so they can always identify us if we got caught outside without our star we'd get in trouble i know it sounds scary but this isn't a story about fear it's a story about hope even when bad things happen there are good things all around on friday june 12th i woke up really early it was my birthday every year my parents put all my presents out on the table and this year i couldn't wait for one particular gift a diary it had its own little lock i love it i started writing immediately dear kitty kitty was the name i gave to my diary i wanted the diary to be my friend a few weeks later we got terrible news what is it dear margo our daughter they sent her a call up notice we knew what a call up really meant the nazis would send people to a concentration camp a prison where jews were locked up and made to work all day and night there was almost nothing to eat or drink if you went there escape was nearly impossible my parents were running out of options if we stayed the nazis would come for my sister if we tried to leave they'd hunt us down there's only one choice we need to hide my parents told us to stop packing we couldn't only take our most important things the first thing i grabbed was this diary a book yes a place to hold my daily thoughts we wore layers of clothes so no one would see us carrying suitcases the hardest part was saying goodbye to my cat the neighbors will take good care of her i promise my father said i love you mosh day as we snuck out there were four of us and another family of three met us there this was our hiding spot a small area at the back of my father's office the secret annex the bookcase covered the entryway and could swing shut so no one would find us and here's what she wrote our hiding place has now become a true hiding place our new home was about the size of one bedroom apartment for seven of us this was my parents living room and bedroom how are we all going to fit see the attic up top the bookcase entrance and this was for me and my sister abscess was another room it was a bedroom kitchen and living room all in one for the van pelt the other

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What was the significance of the Jewish star that Anne Frank and her family had to wear?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the rights taken away from Anne and the Jews, while Question 5 asks about the significance of the Jewish star, which is related to the restrictions and persecutions faced by the Jews.

However, if I had to choose a question that more closely matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say:

**Question 3: Why did Anne Frank's family move to Amsterdam?**

This question is not a direct match, but it is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ, which mentions the arrival of the Germans in the Netherlands and the changes that occurred in Anne's life.

But since Question 3 is not a direct match, I will provide an alternative answer.

A more suitable generated MCQ could be created by combining elements of Questions 3 and 5. However, since this is not an option, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is:

**Question 5**

**Transcript**:
As the sun rises over Delphi in 500 BCE, Aristonike hurries
to the temple of Apollo. Like all Greeks, she's known the legend
of Delphi since childhood. Two eagles released by Zeus 
from opposite ends of the Earth met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, identifying Delphi 
as the center of the world. Marking this spot was a mysterious stone
guarded by a legendary serpent called the pytho. But when Apollo killed the pytho,
he made Delphi his home— establishing the city
as the best place in the world to seek guidance directly
from the God of Prophecy. Well, almost directly. At any given time, a single oracle known 
as the Pythia communicates Apollo’s will. Reserved only for women, this is 
the most important job in the city— and one that Aristonike will soon have to 
take on as the current Pythia-in-training. Despite serving in the Temple of Apollo 
for many years, Aristonike is still uncertain that she’s
wise enough to fulfill this role. But these doubts will have to wait. Today she’ll be shadowed by officials 
from the city’s governing council. If her performance meets their standards, this is the day she’ll become 
the new Oracle of Delphi. In the heart of the temenos, 
or sacred enclosure, Aristonike greets the current Oracle
and the city officials. The group joins the procession
to the Castilian Spring, where the Pythia performs 
a purification ceremony to prepare for a day of prophecy. To establish whether
Apollo is willing to be consulted, Aristonike brings water from the spring 
to the temple priests, who sprinkle it on a goat. If the goat shudders, 
it will be a prophecy day. If not, travelers from as far away as 
modern day Sicily, Egypt, and Afghanistan will have to wait an entire month 
to consult the Oracle again. Fortunately, Apollo
is in a communicative mood. Delphians are first in line, most seeking
advice about business or marriage. Following the locals are other Greeks 
and then non-Greeks, including ambassadors from great
cities who plan to ask about whether to go to war, 
or where they should found new colonies. Most supplicants bring two options
for the Pythia to choose between, alongside the obligatory sacrificial cake. Aristonike reports back to the Pythia, pointing out important figures 
and sharing some of their concerns— all while the city counselor takes
notes on her performance. Then the Pythia disappears into her 
oracular chamber known as the adyton. Inside, she’ll channel the inspiration 
of Apollo, uttering ambiguous prophecies
the questioners must interpret. The adyton is the one place in the temple 
Aristonike isn’t allowed to go. So while consultations continue, the Oracle-in-training sets off to collect
wood for the temple’s eternal flame. While gathering branches 
from the sacred laurel trees, Aristonike spies wealthy Greeks 
training for the upcoming Pythian Games. Second in importance only to the Olympics, these games bring great riches
and attention to Delphi. Typically, Aristonike would pause
to admire the athletes, but today she’s more focused
on impressing her observer. Taking the exact amount
of branches necessary, she hurries back to the temple 
for her long awaited evaluation. The counselor who shadowed her 
shares his notes with the other officials, and after a brief discussion,
their leader nods. He endorses Aristonike as the new Oracle— and the Pythia offers Apollo’s blessing 
on their verdict. Approaching Aristonike 
beside the sacred hearth, the Pythia finally unveils 
the secrets of her trade. Passed directly from one Oracle 
to the next, no history book will ever
record these details. But the Pythia’s insights will guide 
all of Aristonike’s future prophecies— shaping wars, politics, and relationships
for years to come, and making Aristonike one of the most
powerful women in the ancient world. As the Pythia concludes her final lesson, she points to two inscriptions 
on the temple walls: “know yourself” and “nothing in excess.” Left alone to ponder these ideas, Aristonike feels the first touch 
of Apollo’s inspiration— the insight that keeping an open mind
may be more important than finding a single answer.

**Question 2: What was the role of the Pythia in Delphi? Options: A. To govern the city and make laws., B. To communicate Apollo's will to those seeking guidance., C. To perform purification ceremonies at the Castilian Spring., D. To train athletes for the Pythian Games. Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not directly ask about the god that offers prophecies at Delphi. A more relevant question would be one that directly asks about Apollo or the god associated with the Oracle of Delphi.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the god that offers prophecies at Delphi. But if we had to choose one based on the association with Apollo, it would be:

**Question 5: What was the adyton, and what happened there? Options: A. The adyton was a sacred laurel tree where the Pythia would channel Apollo's inspiration., B.

The adyton was the Castilian Spring, where the Pythia would perform purification ceremonies. Correct Option: B**

This question mentions Apollo's inspiration, which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not directly ask about the god that offers prophecies.

If we had to choose an index, it would be **5**, but please note that this is not a direct match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the god associated with the Oracle of Delphi, such as:

to the temple of Apollo. Like all Greeks, she's known the legend
of Delphi since childhood. Two eagles released by Zeus 
from opposite ends of the Earth met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, identifying Delphi 
as the center of the world. Marking this spot was a mysterious stone
guarded by a legendary serpent called the pytho. But when Apollo killed the pytho,
he made Delphi his home— establishing the city
as the best place in the world to seek guidance directly
from the God of Prophecy. Well, almost directly. At any given time, a single oracle known 
as the Pythia communicates Apollo’s will. Reserved only for women, this is 
the most important job in the city— and one that Aristonike will soon have to 
take on as the current Pythia-in-training. Despite serving in the Temple of Apollo 
for many years, Aristonike is still uncertain that she’s
wise enough to fulfill this role. But these doubts will have to wait. Today she’ll be shadowed by officials 
from the city’s governing council. If her performance meets their standards, this is the day she’ll become 
the new Oracle of Delphi. In the heart of the temenos, 
or sacred enclosure, Aristonike greets the current Oracle
and the city officials. The group joins the procession
to the Castilian Spring, where the Pythia performs 
a purification ceremony to prepare for a day of prophecy. To establish whether
Apollo is willing to be consulted, Aristonike brings water from the spring 
to the temple priests, who sprinkle it on a goat. If the goat shudders, 
it will be a prophecy day. If not, travelers from as far away as 
modern day Sicily, Egypt, and Afghanistan will have to wait an entire month 
to consult the Oracle again. Fortunately, Apollo
is in a communicative mood. Delphians are first in line, most seeking
advice about business or marriage. Following the locals are other Greeks 
and then non-Greeks, including ambassadors from great
cities who plan to ask about whether to go to war, 
or where they should found new colonies. Most supplicants bring two options
for the Pythia to choose between, alongside the obligatory sacrificial cake. Aristonike reports back to the Pythia, pointing out important figures 
and sharing some of their concerns— all while the city counselor takes
notes on her performance. Then the Pythia disappears into her 
oracular chamber known as the adyton. Inside, she’ll channel the inspiration 
of Apollo, uttering ambiguous prophecies
the questioners must interpret. The adyton is the one place in the temple 
Aristonike isn’t allowed to go. So while consultations continue, the Oracle-in-training sets off to collect
wood for the temple’s eternal flame. While gathering branches 
from the sacred laurel trees, Aristonike spies wealthy Greeks 
training for the upcoming Pythian Games. Second in importance only to the Olympics, these games bring great riches
and attention to Delphi. Typically, Aristonike would pause
to admire the athletes, but today she’s more focused
on impressing her observer. Taking the exact amount
of branches necessary, she hurries back to the temple 
for her long awaited evaluation. The counselor who shadowed her 
shares his notes with the other officials, and after a brief discussion,
their leader nods. He endorses Aristonike as the new Oracle— and the Pythia offers Apollo’s blessing 
on their verdict. Approaching Aristonike 
beside the sacred hearth, the Pythia finally unveils 
the secrets of her trade. Passed directly from one Oracle 
to the next, no history book will ever
record these details. But the Pythia’s insights will guide 
all of Aristonike’s future prophecies— shaping wars, politics, and relationships
for years to come, and making Aristonike one of the most
powerful women in the ancient world. As the Pythia concludes her final lesson, she points to two inscriptions 
on the temple walls: “know yourself” and “nothing in excess.” Left alone to ponder these ideas, Aristonike feels the first touch 
of Apollo’s inspiration— the insight that keeping an open mind
may be more important than finding a single answer.

**Transcript**:
I grew up in the late '70s in rural China during the final years of my country's
pursuit of absolute equality at the expense of liberty. At that time, everybody had a job, but everyone was struggling. In the early '80s,
my dad was an electrician, and my mom worked two shifts
in the local hospital. But still, we didn't have enough food, and our living conditions were dismal. We were undoubtedly equal -- we were equally poor. The state owned everything. We owned nothing. The story I'm going to share with you
is about my struggles of overcoming adversity with my resilience, grit
and sheer determination. No, I'm just kidding,
I'm not going to do that to you. (Laughter) Instead, I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to talk about today
is about a new form of collective poverty that many of us don't recognize and that urgently needs to be understood. I'm sure you've noticed
that in the past 20 years, that asset has emerged. It's been generating wealth
at a breakneck pace. As a tool, it has brought businesses
deep customer insights, operational efficiency and enormous top-line growth. But for some, it has also provided a device
to manipulate a democratic election or perform surveillance
for profit or political purposes. What is this miracle asset? You've guessed it: it's data. Seven out of the top 10 most valuable
companies in the world are tech companies that either directly generate
profit from data or are empowered by data from the core. Multiple surveys show that the vast majority
of business decision makers regard data as an essential
asset for success. We have all experienced how data
is shifting this major paradigm shift for our personal, economic
and political lives. Whoever owns the data owns the future. But who's producing the data? I assume everyone in this room
has a smartphone, several social media accounts and has done a Google search
or two in the past week. We are all producing data. Yes. It is estimated that by 2030,
10 years from now, there will be about 125 billion
connected devices in the world. That's an average of about
15 devices per person. We are already producing data every day. We'll be producing exponentially more. Google, Facebook and Tencent's
combined revenue in 2018 was 236 billion US dollars. Now, how many of you
have received payment from them for the data you generate for them? None, right? Data has immense value
but is centrally controlled and owned. You are all walking raw materials
for those large data companies, but none of you are paid. Not only that, you're not even considered
as part of this equation for income. So once again, we are undoubtedly equal: we're equally poor. Somebody else owns everything,
and we own nothing. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? So what should we do? There might be some clues
in how my life turned out after that difficult start. Things began to look up
for my family in the '80s. The system evolved, and people began to be allowed
to own a piece of what we created. "People diving into the ocean," or "xia hai," the Chinese term, described those who left
state-owned enterprise jobs and started their own businesses. Private ownership of a business became personal ownership of cars, properties, food, clothes and things. The economic machine started rolling, and people's lives began to improve. For the first time, to get rich was glorious. So in the '90s, when I went
to study in Chengdu in west China, many young individuals like myself were well-positioned
to take advantage of the new system. After I graduated from my university, I cofounded my first business
and moved to Shenzhen, the brand-new special economic zone
that used to be a fishing village. Twenty years later, Shenzhen has become
a global innovation powerhouse. Private ownership was a form of liberty
we didn't have before. It created unprecedented opportunities
for our generations, motivating us to work
and study incredibly hard. The result was that more than
850 million people rose out of poverty. According to the World Bank, China's extreme poverty rate in 1981,
when I was a little kid, was 88 percent. By 2015, 0.7 percent. I am a product of that success, and I am very happy to share that today,
I have my own AI business, and I lead a very worldly
and dynamic life, a path that was unimaginable
when I was a kid in west China. Of course, this prosperity
came with a trade-off, with equality,
the environment and freedom. And obviously I'm not here to argue
that China has it all figured out. We haven't. Nor that data is fully comparable
to physical assets. It is not. But my life experience allowed me
to see what's hiding in plain sight. Currently, the public discourse is so focused on the regulatory
and privacy issue when it comes to data ownership. But I want to ask: What if we look at data ownership
in completely different ways? What if data ownership is, in fact, a personal, individual and economic issue? What if, in the new digital economy, we are allowed to own
a piece of what we create and give people the liberty
of private data ownership? The legal concept of ownership
is when you can possess, use, gift, pass on, destroy or trade it or sell your asset at a price accepted by you. What if we give that same definition
to individuals' data, so individuals can use or destroy our data or we trade it at our chosen price? Now, I know some of you might say, "I would never, ever trade my data
for any amount of money." But that, let me remind you,
is exactly what you're doing now, except you're giving
your data away for free. Plus, privacy is a very personal
and nuanced issue. You might have the privilege
to prioritize your privacy over money, but for millions of small
business owners in China who can't get bank loans easily, using their data to gain rapid loan
approval from AI-powered lenders can answer their more pressing needs. What's private to you is different from
what's private to others. What's private to you now is different from what was private
when you were in college. Or, at least, I hope so. (Laughter) We are always,
although often subconsciously, making such trade-offs based on our diverse personal beliefs
and life priorities. That is why data ownership
would be incomplete without a pricing power. By assigning pricing power to individuals, we gain a tool to reflect
our personal and nuanced preferences. So, for example, you could choose
to donate your data for free if a contribution
to a particular medical research is very meaningful for you. Or, if we had the tools
to set our behavior data at a price of, say,
100,000 US dollars, I doubt any political group
would be able to target or manipulate your vote. You control. You decide. Now, I know this sounds
probably implausible, but trends are already pointing to a growing and very powerful
individual data ownership movement. First, start-ups
are already creating tools to allow us to take back some control. A new browser called Brave empowers users with "Brave Shields" --
they literally call it that -- by aggressively blocking
data-grabbing ads and trackers, and avoid leaking data
like other browsers. In return, users can take back
some bargaining and pricing power. When users opt in to accept ads, Brave rewards users
with "basic attention tokens" that can redeem content
behind paywalls from publishers. And I've been using Brave
for a few months. It has already blocked
more than 200,000 ads and trackers and saved hours of my time. Now, I know some of you
interact with your browser more than with your partners, so -- (Laughter) you should at least find one that doesn't
waste your time and is not creepy. (Laughter) Do you think Google is indispensable? Think again. A search engine is indispensable. Google just has the monopoly -- for now. A search engine called DuckDuckGo
doesn't store your personal information or follow you around with ads or track your personal browsing history. Instead, it gives all users
the same search results instead of based on
your personal browsing records. In London, a company called digi.me offers an app you can download
on your smartphone that helps to import and consolidate
your data generated by you from your Fitbit, Spotify, social media accounts ... And you can choose
where to store your data, and digi.me will help you
to make your data work for you by providing insights that used
to be exclusively accessible by large data companies. In DC, a new initiative
called UBDI, U-B-D-I, Universal Basic Data Income, helps people to make money by sharing anonymous insights
through their data for companies that can use them
for market research. And whenever a company purchases a study, users get paid in cash and UBDI points
to track their contribution, potentially as much
as 1,000 US dollars per year per their estimation. UBDI could be a very feasible path
for universal basic income in the AI economy. Further, individual awareness
of privacy and data ownership is growing fast as we all become aware of this monster
we have unleashed in our pocket. I'm a mother of two preteen girls, and trust me, the single biggest source of stress
and anxiety as a parent, for me, is my children's
relationship with technology. This is a three-page agreement
my husband and I make them sign before they receive
their first [mobile phone]. (Laughter) We want to help them to become digital citizens, but only if we can make them
become smart and responsible ones. I help them to understand
what kind of data should never be shared. So if you Google me, in fact -- actually, sorry --
if you DuckDuckGo me, you will find maybe a lot
about me and my work, but you may find no information
about my daughters. When they grow up, if they want to put themselves out there,
it's their choice, not mine, despite that I insist
they're the most beautiful, smartest and most extraordinary
kids in the world, of course. And I know many people
are having similar conversations and making similar decisions, which gives me hope that a truly smart data-rich future
will be here soon. But I want to highlight
the Clause 6 of this agreement. It says, "I will never, ever search
for any information online if I would be embarrassed
if seen by Grandma Dawnie." (Laughter) Try it. It's really effective. (Laughter) Throughout history, there has always been a trade-off
between liberty and equality in the pursuit of prosperity. The world has constantly been going
through the circle of wealth accumulation to wealth redistribution. As the tension between
the haves and have-nots is breaking so many countries, it is in everyone's interest, including the large data companies, to prevent this new form of inequality. Of course, individual data ownership
is not the perfect nor the complete answer to this profoundly complex question of what makes a good digital society. But according to McKinsey, AI will add 13 trillion US dollars
of economic output in the next 10 years. Data generated by individuals
will no doubt contribute to this enormous growth. Shouldn't we at least consider
an economic model that empowers the people? And if private ownership helped
to lift more than 850 million people out of poverty, it is our duty and we owe it to future generations to create a more inclusive AI economy that will empower the people
in addition to businesses. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
We have lots in common with our closest
primate relatives. But comparatively, humans seem a bit... 
underdressed. Instead of thick fur covering our bodies, many of us mainly have hair 
on top of our heads— and a few other places. So, how did we get so naked? 
And why do we have hair where we do? Human hair and animal fur 
are made of the same stuff: filaments of the protein keratin that grow
out of organs known as follicles, which go through cycles 
of growth and shedding. Across mammalian species, hairs have been 
modified for numerous purposes, ranging from the soft fluff 
covering rabbits to the rigid quills protecting porcupines. But for many mammals, 
hair grows in two layers consisting of a shorter undercoat 
of ground hairs covered by longer guard hairs. Together, they help insulate 
the animal’s body and protect its skin. Human hairs, on the other hand, are 
kind of a combination of these hair types. Unfortunately, 
hair is rarely found in fossils, making it hard for researchers
to pinpoint when and how our ancient ancestors lost their coats. But scientists have developed
some working hypotheses. It seems that, 
millions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of
trees and adopted a more active lifestyle. Keeping cool became 
increasingly important. Eventually, they developed
more sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating
moisture through the skin. In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat
glands than chimpanzees, for instance. But efficiently losing heat by sweating is
harder to do when you’re covered in fur. Scientists believe that early humans
lost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster. However, if losing our hair
was so advantageous, why do we have any left at all? It seems that there are unique uses 
for hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation 
likely played a part again. Since early humans
began venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed
to the scorching sun. Thicker, longer-growing hair protects
our sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating. Dark tightly curled hair is most effective
at keeping solar radiation off of skin. Other kinds of head hair evolved
as humans moved to different places. Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows 
are especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial
muscles that convey our feelings. Eyelashes have been shown to minimize
airflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying
out and catching debris. And maybe facial hair proved helpful in
distinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...
more pungent. Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas
are dotted with apocrine glands. They produce oily, smelly secretions
which the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots 
helps disperse. The secretions that waft off these hairy
patches may be useful for identification. For example, several studies have shown
that people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those
of people they’re close with. The final type of notable human hair is
the vellus hair that covers our bodies. We don't know if these hairs serve
any purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from
are essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury. They’re also important sites 
of nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain. In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density 
of body hair as apes of comparable sizes. So despite all this talk
of human nakedness, we're not actually as hairless as we look.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the different forms of hair in mammals and asks to identify which option is NOT an example of one of these forms. The generated MCQs do not have a direct match for this question. However, Question 2 is related to the topic of hair in mammals, but it asks about the primary function of the two layers of hair in many mammals.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2. However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the question content, options, and intent are not identical.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: What is the likely reason why early humans lost much of their coat?**

Although this question does not directly ask about sweat glands and sweating, it is related to the concept of heat loss and the evolution of the human body, which is the underlying theme of the ground truth MCQ. However, a closer examination of the options in Question 4 reveals that it does not match the ground truth MCQ as closely as I initially thought.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found a better match:

**Question 3: A person is planning to go for a run on a hot summer day. Based on the information provided, what would be the most effective way for them to lose heat?**

This question is more closely related to the concept of sweating and heat loss, which is the focus of the ground truth MCQ. However, the options in Question 3 do not directly address the statement about sweat glands and sweating being false.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, although it is still not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the question stems are not identical, the content and options of Question 5 are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the location of apocrine glands, while Question 5 asks about the purpose of apocrine glands found in specific locations (armpits, nipples, and pubic areas). The correct option in Question 5 (B) mentions the production of oily, smelly secretions that aid in identification, which is related to the function of apocrine glands mentioned in the transcript. 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 5, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We have lots in common with our closest
primate relatives. But comparatively, humans seem a bit... 
underdressed. Instead of thick fur covering our bodies, many of us mainly have hair 
on top of our heads— and a few other places. So, how did we get so naked? 
And why do we have hair where we do? Human hair and animal fur 
are made of the same stuff: filaments of the protein keratin that grow
out of organs known as follicles, which go through cycles 
of growth and shedding. Across mammalian species, hairs have been 
modified for numerous purposes, ranging from the soft fluff 
covering rabbits to the rigid quills protecting porcupines. But for many mammals, 
hair grows in two layers consisting of a shorter undercoat 
of ground hairs covered by longer guard hairs. Together, they help insulate 
the animal’s body and protect its skin. Human hairs, on the other hand, are 
kind of a combination of these hair types. Unfortunately, 
hair is rarely found in fossils, making it hard for researchers
to pinpoint when and how our ancient ancestors lost their coats. But scientists have developed
some working hypotheses. It seems that, 
millions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of
trees and adopted a more active lifestyle. Keeping cool became 
increasingly important. Eventually, they developed
more sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating
moisture through the skin. In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat
glands than chimpanzees, for instance. But efficiently losing heat by sweating is
harder to do when you’re covered in fur. Scientists believe that early humans
lost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster. However, if losing our hair
was so advantageous, why do we have any left at all? It seems that there are unique uses 
for hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation 
likely played a part again. Since early humans
began venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed
to the scorching sun. Thicker, longer-growing hair protects
our sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating. Dark tightly curled hair is most effective
at keeping solar radiation off of skin. Other kinds of head hair evolved
as humans moved to different places. Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows 
are especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial
muscles that convey our feelings. Eyelashes have been shown to minimize
airflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying
out and catching debris. And maybe facial hair proved helpful in
distinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...
more pungent. Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas
are dotted with apocrine glands. They produce oily, smelly secretions
which the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots 
helps disperse. The secretions that waft off these hairy
patches may be useful for identification. For example, several studies have shown
that people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those
of people they’re close with. The final type of notable human hair is
the vellus hair that covers our bodies. We don't know if these hairs serve
any purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from
are essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury. They’re also important sites 
of nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain. In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density 
of body hair as apes of comparable sizes. So despite all this talk
of human nakedness, we're not actually as hairless as we look.

**Transcript**:
The Trojan War has been raging 
for 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans 
prevailing. Gods and humans alike
are desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races
across the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce. From high up on Olympus you’ve been 
waiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war 
to its conclusion. When you go to consult the Fates,
they advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days,
all will end soon. However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more
devastating years of war. The Fates’ loom has shown them 
the exact conditions that will keep the truce intact. The great Trojan plain can be viewed 
as a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments. If they’re organized in such a way that 
any Greek can reach any other Greek camp without having to pass through a Trojan 
camp, and likewise for Trojans, plus neither side completely surrounds 
the other, peace will prevail. Anyone can move to a horizontally
or vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally. The problem is,
they’re currently arranged like this. Tonight, you can use your powers to swap
up to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally adjacent. No camp can be moved more than once. Which swaps do you make
to keep the peace? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide
this into two sub-problems. There’s the matter of connecting 
4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line. And then there’s dealing 
with the thorny center space. Let’s consider the Greeks first. To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess 
with the nice, straight Trojan lines. If you try to do that anywhere
in the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated
clusters of Trojans. So the only option is to go 
to the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally,
say here, here, and here. Now for the center. there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms 
without swapping a Trojan in. But continuing to shift that arm 
of Trojans inward would require moving 
the same Greek camp multiple times. However, you could shift the whole
Trojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several
solutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver
on the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves. You make the swaps and all is well 
until the fifth night. One of your rival gods wants
to see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage 
of a forgotten prophecy. He’s convinced one Trojan camp 
to make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity. Once again, you consult the Fates,
who prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere
within four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield. They won’t go through with a swap 
if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity. And finally, you can make 
at most two swaps with the same rules as before 
to thwart them. Which swaps do you make 
to block the troublesome Trojan camp? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify
the scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do 
to at least narrow down the options. They have to be somewhere in this area. And they have to be able to block Greek
camps from each other in a single swap. That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages 
are at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole
without opening a new one. So they must be in one of these 
four camps. Let’s look at the right arm first. There’s a threat here because this column 
has two Trojan camps. If one moves to the right, 
the other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing. so we can thwart them by moving either one
a column left into this square. and the same principle applies 
to the bottom arm. Your effort maintains the peace 
for the final 5 days. But it seems that a certain Greek general
noticed what was happening and left the Trojans a parting gift...

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 8. 

However, the question content does not exactly match. Ground truth MCQ is asking about "neutralizations" but it seems to refer to the number of swaps needed to thwart the troublesome Trojan camp, which is the same as the content of Question 8.

The correct answer for both the ground truth MCQ and Question 8 is not the same, though. Ground truth MCQ has a correct answer of 4 (option C), while Question 8 has a correct answer of 2 (option B). However, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 8 is still the most similar in terms of question intent and content.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8.

**Transcript**:
The Trojan War has been raging 
for 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans 
prevailing. Gods and humans alike
are desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races
across the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce. From high up on Olympus you’ve been 
waiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war 
to its conclusion. When you go to consult the Fates,
they advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days,
all will end soon. However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more
devastating years of war. The Fates’ loom has shown them 
the exact conditions that will keep the truce intact. The great Trojan plain can be viewed 
as a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments. If they’re organized in such a way that 
any Greek can reach any other Greek camp without having to pass through a Trojan 
camp, and likewise for Trojans, plus neither side completely surrounds 
the other, peace will prevail. Anyone can move to a horizontally
or vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally. The problem is,
they’re currently arranged like this. Tonight, you can use your powers to swap
up to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally adjacent. No camp can be moved more than once. Which swaps do you make
to keep the peace? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide
this into two sub-problems. There’s the matter of connecting 
4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line. And then there’s dealing 
with the thorny center space. Let’s consider the Greeks first. To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess 
with the nice, straight Trojan lines. If you try to do that anywhere
in the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated
clusters of Trojans. So the only option is to go 
to the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally,
say here, here, and here. Now for the center. there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms 
without swapping a Trojan in. But continuing to shift that arm 
of Trojans inward would require moving 
the same Greek camp multiple times. However, you could shift the whole
Trojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several
solutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver
on the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves. You make the swaps and all is well 
until the fifth night. One of your rival gods wants
to see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage 
of a forgotten prophecy. He’s convinced one Trojan camp 
to make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity. Once again, you consult the Fates,
who prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere
within four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield. They won’t go through with a swap 
if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity. And finally, you can make 
at most two swaps with the same rules as before 
to thwart them. Which swaps do you make 
to block the troublesome Trojan camp? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify
the scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do 
to at least narrow down the options. They have to be somewhere in this area. And they have to be able to block Greek
camps from each other in a single swap. That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages 
are at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole
without opening a new one. So they must be in one of these 
four camps. Let’s look at the right arm first. There’s a threat here because this column 
has two Trojan camps. If one moves to the right, 
the other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing. so we can thwart them by moving either one
a column left into this square. and the same principle applies 
to the bottom arm. Your effort maintains the peace 
for the final 5 days. But it seems that a certain Greek general
noticed what was happening and left the Trojans a parting gift...

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7. 

However, the question content is not an exact match. Ground truth MCQ is about whether an "A" can make a particular "B" camp unable to travel to some other "B" camp passing only through "B" or neutral camps. Generated MCQ 7 is about the constraint on the meddling Trojan camp's swap.

A more suitable match could be Generated MCQ 3, which discusses the organization of Greek and Trojan camps to maintain peace. But it does not directly address the issue of one camp making another unable to travel.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that is closest in terms of intent.

**Transcript**:
You're traveling deep beneath
the ocean's surface, where faint lights flicker
and toothy grins flash. You are now entering... the Twilight Zone. Your mission is to survive these depths and journey to the surface 
after sundown to feed. You may now pick your player. Just kidding— you don’t have a choice. You’re a hatchetfish. And almost everything else 
is trying to eat you. The tools at your disposal 
are a uniquely shaped body, shiny scales, and glowing spots
on your belly. You’re going to need a lot of skill 
and a little luck. Your first challenge is to begin 
your upwards trek. Your swim bladder allows you 
to precisely control your buoyancy. Come nightfall, you slowly fill it up, becoming less dense and rising
towards the surface. You can’t swim fast, but your narrow build
makes you maneuverable. This is especially important since
predators could spring out of the darkness at any moment. In fact, a fangtooth 
is gliding beneath you. It has the ocean’s biggest
tooth-to-body size ratio. Food is hard to come 
by in the Twilight Zone, so predators have fearsome adaptations
to make every attack count. The fangtooth’s skin is ultra-black: it reflects less than 0.5% of the light 
that hits it, making this fish particularly
hard to spot. Fortunately, the bioluminescent organs
lining your belly are regulated to match the intensity and pattern of the 
faint light from the ocean’s surface. This counter-illumination disguises
your silhouette. So when the fangtooth gazes upwards,
you’re almost invisible. A bright spot appears in the distance. You go to check it out, 
but something’s looming in the darkness. The light is a bioluminescent lure
belonging to an anglerfish. You dart away before it quickly
opens its jaws, sucking in a hapless fish 
that got too close. Another narrow escape, 
but you’re nearly there. Although more than 90% 
of deep-sea creatures are bioluminescent, only one group produces the color red: 
dragonfishes. One of them is near. Because red light is quickly absorbed 
by seawater, most deep-sea inhabitants can’t see it. The dragonfish emits red light
from organs by its eyes, using an invisible headlight to locate
unsuspecting prey that its scoops 
into its cavernous jaw. You can’t see your enemy, but your silvery, mirror-like scales
scatter and soften direct light, keeping you hidden. After three close calls, 
you reach... the Photic Zone. You’ve just participated 
in the world’s largest migration. It takes place every night as trillions
of organisms rise from the ocean’s depths to enjoy the surface’s rich resources 
under the cover of darkness. The payoff is huge. Here, your light-sensitive eyes take
in a buffet of small crustaceans and gelatinous zooplankton. During the day, phytoplankton use sunlight
to turn dissolved carbon dioxide into energy and build their own cells. They become food for small grazers,
forming the base of the food web, which extends back down 
to the Twilight Zone— and beyond. Organic matter generated up here—
like bits of skin, poop, and dead animals— eventually sinks or is transported 
in the stomachs of animals returning from their nightly migrations. These materials then feed the creatures
below that don't migrate. This ensures that some of the carbon 
from the atmosphere is locked away in the ocean 
for hundreds of years to come. That's why this process is known
as the biological carbon pump. Without it, there’d be much
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it contributes to climate change. Your avatar, the hatchetfish, 
is part of this crucial process. Your first quest is complete, but you must repeat this journey 
every night for the rest of your life. As the sun rises, 
the surface becomes dangerous, and you descend back into the shadows 
of the Twilight Zone.

**Transcript**:
You're traveling deep beneath
the ocean's surface, where faint lights flicker
and toothy grins flash. You are now entering... the Twilight Zone. Your mission is to survive these depths and journey to the surface 
after sundown to feed. You may now pick your player. Just kidding— you don’t have a choice. You’re a hatchetfish. And almost everything else 
is trying to eat you. The tools at your disposal 
are a uniquely shaped body, shiny scales, and glowing spots
on your belly. You’re going to need a lot of skill 
and a little luck. Your first challenge is to begin 
your upwards trek. Your swim bladder allows you 
to precisely control your buoyancy. Come nightfall, you slowly fill it up, becoming less dense and rising
towards the surface. You can’t swim fast, but your narrow build
makes you maneuverable. This is especially important since
predators could spring out of the darkness at any moment. In fact, a fangtooth 
is gliding beneath you. It has the ocean’s biggest
tooth-to-body size ratio. Food is hard to come 
by in the Twilight Zone, so predators have fearsome adaptations
to make every attack count. The fangtooth’s skin is ultra-black: it reflects less than 0.5% of the light 
that hits it, making this fish particularly
hard to spot. Fortunately, the bioluminescent organs
lining your belly are regulated to match the intensity and pattern of the 
faint light from the ocean’s surface. This counter-illumination disguises
your silhouette. So when the fangtooth gazes upwards,
you’re almost invisible. A bright spot appears in the distance. You go to check it out, 
but something’s looming in the darkness. The light is a bioluminescent lure
belonging to an anglerfish. You dart away before it quickly
opens its jaws, sucking in a hapless fish 
that got too close. Another narrow escape, 
but you’re nearly there. Although more than 90% 
of deep-sea creatures are bioluminescent, only one group produces the color red: 
dragonfishes. One of them is near. Because red light is quickly absorbed 
by seawater, most deep-sea inhabitants can’t see it. The dragonfish emits red light
from organs by its eyes, using an invisible headlight to locate
unsuspecting prey that its scoops 
into its cavernous jaw. You can’t see your enemy, but your silvery, mirror-like scales
scatter and soften direct light, keeping you hidden. After three close calls, 
you reach... the Photic Zone. You’ve just participated 
in the world’s largest migration. It takes place every night as trillions
of organisms rise from the ocean’s depths to enjoy the surface’s rich resources 
under the cover of darkness. The payoff is huge. Here, your light-sensitive eyes take

However, an even more similar question is Question 5, as it specifically mentions that "most deep-sea inhabitants can't see" the color produced by the dragonfish, which is the main point of the ground truth MCQ.

But the most similar question is actually Question 5's predecessor, which would be a question that directly asks about the color that most deep-sea creatures can't see.

Among the given options, the most similar question is Question 5's indirect predecessor, Question 4's indirect successor: Question 5.

So the correct answer is Question 5.

**Transcript**:
[Music] I study rumors not tabloid gossip for the kind of rumors that are making stock markets crash or soar but the kind of rumors that affect your health and the world's health like eating a lot of garlic or drinking a lot of water is going to help protect us from coronavirus if only rumors have a bad reputation they're seen as not fact wrong or just a rumor but I've studied rumors for years and one thing I've learned is that they all have a story and often an important story one of the most moving or alarming rumor episodes that I investigated was in northern Nigeria I was working with UNICEF's global immunization program and it wasn't the rumors themselves that I found so alarming it was the global impact of those rumors the rumors were suspecting that the polio vaccine was actually a contraceptive it was controlling populations or maybe it caused AIDS no no maybe it's the CIA spying on them or counting them I mean why else would they have people knocking on their door again and again with the same polio vaccine when children are dying of measles no one was coming with measles vaccines this wasn't about getting the facts right this was about trust was about broken trust why so much distrust it wasn't the mothers who were particularly distrusting actually it was the local leaders the religious leaders the local political leaders it was the governor of the state of Cano who decided to boycott the entire polio eradication effort in that eight for 11 months why such distrust well it was 2003 it was two years after 9/11 and they were convinced that the West and particularly the United States was at war with Muslims and they knew that the West and particularly the United States was a huge supporter and funder of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative they had their reasoning that lack of trust that just a rumor or to cost the polio eradication program 500 million dollars to reset the clock to regain the progress lost during those 11 months and beyond it the Nigerian strain of the polio virus traveled to over 20 countries as far as Indonesia the cost of a rumor the Nigeria episode was one of many episodes that I investigated when I was with UNICEF and earned the title of the director of UNICEF fire department we at that point I realized I never really had enough time I was too busy putting out the fires and not enough time to understand what was driving not just the individual episodes but why was there an epidemic of these happening around the world I left UNICEF and went back to research applied research and I set up in 2010 what I called the vaccine confidence project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine I convened anthropologists epidemiologists psychologists digital media specialists and mathematical modelers we set ourselves the task to investigate historic episodes of rumors and their impacts from trying to figure out what were the early signals what were the amplifying factors and the impacts how did they get traction so we could start to understand what we should be looking for how we could help governments and immunization program be more alert and responsive to early signals of problems it was an early warning system in 2015 we developed a vaccine confidence index it's a it's a survey with trying to investigate to what extent two people agree or disagree that vaccines are important they're safe they're effective they work and somehow they're compatible with my religious beliefs we've run this with over a hundreds of thousands of people around the world trying to get our finger on the pulse of confidence and trust but also more importantly looking at when that trust goes up or down because we want to see when it starts to decline that's the time to jump in to get there before there's a crisis like the Nigerian one we also set up 24/7 media and social media monitoring around the world multi-language listening for what's going on on vaccine conversations trying to pick up early concerns or changes in sentiment that we should be paying attention to we've created an ecosystem of different types of information to try to understand what are the public thinking and how can we engage we look for early signals when we find one we have a global network of collaborators in a number of countries who have more local intelligence in that setting to try to understand is this signal misinformation or something brewing that we should know about in London we have a bigger picture we watched the swarms of rumors not just traveling locally but jumping countries we've seen them jump from Japan over to Colombia through Europe and around they move we live in a hyper-connected environment one of the things that we found fascinating and we've learned a lot in the last 10 years this is our 10th anniversary this didn't start yesterday this rumor problem and one of the things we've learned is in our global monitoring that Europe is the most skeptical region in the world France won the prize actually by far and actually some of those rumors have traveled to other parts of the world but we are trying to understand Europe hmm why Europe I thought the US was really had some of the most skepticism but boy I was wrong and a political scientist a colleague we work with John Kennedy he took our data from 28 European countries and he looked at it and correlated with political opinion polling and what did he find he found that people who were most likely to vote for a populist party also were the ones that most likely to strongly disagree that vaccines were important safe were effective what did we learn vaccines cannot escape the political and social turbulence that surrounds it scientists were unprepared for this tsunami of doubt and questions and distrust what why are vaccines so ripe for resistance well we identified a number of things but one they're highly mediated by government that require regulates and sometimes recommends vaccines or often recommends and sometimes requires big business makes vaccines and neither institution government or big business are high in the trust ranks these days and then there's scientists who discover and develop vaccines and they're pretty elite and not accessible to the general public at least the language they third we're in a hyper-connected environment with social media these days and people can share their unfettered views concerns anxieties and worries and find a lot of people that think the way they do and think maybe their worries are worth paying attention to and finally vaccines touch every single life on the planet what are their health intervention besides water touches every single life so if you're looking for something to disrupt it's a perfect stage people are asking all kinds of questions they're asking why are vaccines and these are the kinds of things we're hearing in our social media why can't my child have a personalized vaccination schedule what's the wisdom of so many vaccines what about all those ingredients and preservatives these are not crazy people they're not uneducated they're actually worried mothers but some of them have come to me and say we feel ignored we feel judged if we ask a question and we even feel demonized that maybe were part of some anti vaccine group so we have some listening to do and maybe that's why last year there was research that found that in six months in 2019 on online this was with hundreds a hundred million different users in social media although the numbers of individuals who expressed in their online groups they were positive as groups the ones who are the most negative were recruiting the conversations in the middle that were undecided about whether they wanted to get vaccines the highly negative what we might call the anti vaccine groups we're recruiting the undecided at a rate 500% faster than the pro-vaccine groups 500% faster they were more nimble they were responsive and they were listening most people believe that vaccines are good and they believe in their importance but that belief is under attack we need to build in more opportunities for conversation and there are ways to do it it's not easy for some health professionals to have conversations where their authority is questioned it's uncomfortable and they're just too busy to listen to all these questions but we need to do something about that because we're losing a lot of concerned parents that just want a conversation we should get volunteers trained to sit in waiting rooms to be on hotlines to have online chat forms to have chat boxes in younger kids with younger kids in school teach them about immune systems and teach them that actually you know that vaccine your little brother got well it just inspired your natural immune system it's a great thing and this is why we need to build that confidence we need to listen despite all this questioning and there's a lot of it I hear probably more than a lot of people I am an optimist and my optimism is with a younger generation the younger generation who actually now are becoming very aware of the risks of social media the false news the false identities and they're starting to embrace science and some of them are a group of children whose mothers refuse to vaccinate them last spring of twenty nineteen eighteen year old Ethan Lindenberg went on reddit and put out a post my mother doesn't believe in vaccines she's really worried they cause autism in fact she strongly believes that but I'm 18 I'm a senior in high school I can drive a car I can vote and I could go get my own vaccine can someone tell me where to get it that post went viral it started to get a whole younger movement going I saw Ethan speak at a conference the global vaccine summit at the EU last fall he spoke eloquently and I was impressed in front of a whole forum and he said he told his personal story and then he said to the group he said you know everybody talks about misinformation but I want to tell you about a different kind of misinformation and that's misinformation that says that people like my mother who is a loving mother is a bad person because she doesn't give me a vaccines well I want to tell all of you that she didn't give me a vaccine because she loves me and because she believed that that was the best thing for me I think differently and I will never change her mind but she's not a bad person that was the message from a teenager empathy kindness and understanding we have an abundance of scientific information to debunk false rumors that's not our problem we have a relationship problem not a misinformation problem misinformation is the symptom not the cause if people trust they'll put up with a little risk to avert a much bigger one the one thing that I want and I hope for is that we as a medical and health community have the moral courage and humility to productively engage like Ethan with those who disagree with us I hope so thank you [Applause]

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the rate at which anti-vaccine groups recruit the undecided compared to pro-vaccine groups. While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks about this rate, Question 9 is related to addressing vaccine skepticism, which is the broader topic of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that there is a significant difference between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs. The ground truth MCQ is specific and quantitative, whereas the generated MCQs are more general and qualitative.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9, but with a caveat that it's not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the specific question asked in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, "The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, "Well, now seems good," and the British were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet." Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, "facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions." Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, "Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..." So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, "Yeah, that's gonna work!" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means "shaking off." And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, "The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, "Well, now seems good," and the British were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet." Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, "facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions." Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, "The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, "Well, now seems good," and the British were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet." Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, "facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions." Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, "Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..." So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, "Yeah, that's gonna work!" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means "shaking off." And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the increase in the Jewish population in Palestine between 1920 and 1939. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, as it talks about the Jewish population in Palestine, although it refers to a different time period (1878).

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but the closest one would be:

 Question 2 (although it's not an exact match)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match with the ground truth MCQ, and it would be ideal to generate a new MCQ that directly asks about the increase in the Jewish population in Palestine between 1920 and 1939.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A throbbing, pounding headache. Bright zigzagging lines 
across your field of vision. Sensitivity to light, lingering fatigue, 
disrupted sleep. A migraine can include any
of these symptoms. While an incapacitating headache is one of
the most common experiences of migraine, the word “headache” doesn’t really capture
the wide array of experiences a migraine can entail. No two are alike,
and some don’t even involve a headache. So what then is a migraine?
What’s happening in the brain to cause it? To trace a migraine’s anatomy, we have to begin in the days and hours 
leading up to a migraine, when people often identify warning signs 
ranging from fatigue or mood changes, to bursts of yawning,
sleep disruption, nausea, light and sound sensitivity,
or even increased thirst. These warning signs point 
to a particular part of the brain: the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus normally controls 
the systems behind these symptoms— our body’s internal hormonal balances,
circadian rhythms and water regulation. It has wide connections
throughout the brain, and is more active than usual
in the days before migraine. Another common warning sign
is the migraine aura, which can take the form 
of transient visual changes, tingling, or even trouble speaking. These sensations come from a change 
in charge across cell membranes that leads to spreading changes in brain 
activity and blood flow across the brain. We don't know what triggers
this change in charge, but it can spread quickly 
over the surface of the brain, causing different aura symptoms 
depending on the affected area. If it inches over the visual cortex,
for example, it may cause an image or blind spot
to spread over the visual field. During the headache phase, 
the trigeminal nerve plays a key role. The trigeminal nerve normally transmits 
touch, temperature, and other sensations from the skin to most of the face, 
part of the scalp, and some of the blood vessels
and layers covering the cerebral cortex. Once activated, the trigeminal nerve
transmits pain signals. During a migraine, this pain pathway 
becomes sensitized, meaning the threshold for provoking
pain is lowered. Sensations that would usually 
be pain-free, such as coughing, bending over, 
or light and sound, can become painful. Migraines are as common
as they are diverse, affecting as many as 33% of women
and 13% of men in their lifetimes. Still, there’s much we don’t know 
about them. We can see that migraine 
is a neurological disorder affecting multiple parts of the brain— the brainstem, cerebral hemispheres,
and the nerves themselves. But we don't know for sure what
exactly triggers each step, why some people get migraines
and not others, why so many more women do than men, or why people’s migraine patterns
sometimes change over their lifetimes. Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have
a role in some of these things: some women experience a significant
reduction in migraine frequency after menopause, 
when sex hormone fluctuations are fewer. Meanwhile, just before menopause,
these fluctuations increase, and some women experience 
worsening or new headaches. People with migraines
are more likely to suffer from depression, panic disorder, sleep disorders, 
and strokes, among other illnesses. The relationship with these diseases
is likely complex, possibly reflecting the effect of migraine
on those diseases or vice versa, or reflecting their shared genetic basis. Genetics almost certainly play a role,
although with a few exceptions, there’s no single gene 
that causes migraines. Certain genes control how easily 
our brains’ neurons are excited by environmental stimuli and 
how readily they transmit painful signals. It’s possible that the neurons in the 
brains of people who experience migraines are more easily triggered 
by environmental stimuli and less likely to block painful signals. While there’s no simple way to explain 
what happens in our brains with this complex disorder, one thing is for sure:
migraine is much more than a headache.

**Transcript**:
A throbbing, pounding headache. Bright zigzagging lines 
across your field of vision. Sensitivity to light, lingering fatigue, 
disrupted sleep. A migraine can include any
of these symptoms. While an incapacitating headache is one of
the most common experiences of migraine, the word “headache” doesn’t really capture
the wide array of experiences a migraine can entail. No two are alike,
and some don’t even involve a headache. So what then is a migraine?
What’s happening in the brain to cause it? To trace a migraine’s anatomy, we have to begin in the days and hours 
leading up to a migraine, when people often identify warning signs 
ranging from fatigue or mood changes, to bursts of yawning,
sleep disruption, nausea, light and sound sensitivity,
or even increased thirst. These warning signs point 
to a particular part of the brain: the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus normally controls 
the systems behind these symptoms— our body’s internal hormonal balances,
circadian rhythms and water regulation. It has wide connections
throughout the brain, and is more active than usual
in the days before migraine. Another common warning sign
is the migraine aura, which can take the form 
of transient visual changes, tingling, or even trouble speaking. These sensations come from a change 
in charge across cell membranes that leads to spreading changes in brain 
activity and blood flow across the brain. We don't know what triggers
this change in charge, but it can spread quickly 
over the surface of the brain, causing different aura symptoms 
depending on the affected area. If it inches over the visual cortex,
for example, it may cause an image or blind spot
to spread over the visual field. During the headache phase, 
the trigeminal nerve plays a key role. The trigeminal nerve normally transmits 
touch, temperature, and other sensations from the skin to most of the face, 
part of the scalp, and some of the blood vessels
and layers covering the cerebral cortex. Once activated, the trigeminal nerve
transmits pain signals. During a migraine, this pain pathway 
becomes sensitized, meaning the threshold for provoking
pain is lowered. Sensations that would usually 
be pain-free, such as coughing, bending over, 
or light and sound, can become painful. Migraines are as common
as they are diverse, affecting as many as 33% of women
and 13% of men in their lifetimes. Still, there’s much we don’t know 
about them. We can see that migraine 
is a neurological disorder affecting multiple parts of the brain— the brainstem, cerebral hemispheres,
and the nerves themselves. But we don't know for sure what
exactly triggers each step, why some people get migraines
and not others, why so many more women do than men, or why people’s migraine patterns
sometimes change over their lifetimes. Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have
a role in some of these things: some women experience a significant
reduction in migraine frequency after menopause, 
when sex hormone fluctuations are fewer. Meanwhile, just before menopause,
these fluctuations increase, and some women experience 
worsening or new headaches. People with migraines
are more likely to suffer from depression, panic disorder, sleep disorders, 
and strokes, among other illnesses. The relationship with these diseases
is likely complex, possibly reflecting the effect of migraine
on those diseases or vice versa, or reflecting their shared genetic basis. Genetics almost certainly play a role,
although with a few exceptions, there’s no single gene 
that causes migraines. Certain genes control how easily 
our brains’ neurons are excited by environmental stimuli and 
how readily they transmit painful signals. It’s possible that the neurons in the 
brains of people who experience migraines are more easily triggered 
by environmental stimuli and less likely to block painful signals. While there’s no simple way to explain 
what happens in our brains with this complex disorder, one thing is for sure:
migraine is much more than a headache.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Although Question 6 does not include "strokes" as an option, its intent and content are the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions ask about the disorders or illnesses that people with migraines are more likely to suffer from. 

However, it's worth noting that Question 6 is not an exact match, as it does not include "strokes" as an option. A more accurate generated MCQ would include all the options mentioned in the ground truth MCQ (A. Panic disorder, B. Sleep disorders, C. Strokes, D. Depression, E. All of the above). 

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that more accurately matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What’s as big as a polar bear, 
swallows its prey whole, and swims at 40 miles an hour? It’s not a shark or a killer whale. It’s the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The largest and longest-lived
of the 15 tuna species, the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set
of adaptations that make it one of the most dominant 
predators in the ocean. It starts as a tiny hatchling in the 
Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea, no bigger than a human eyelash. Within its first year of life, It develops something known as 
regional endothermy— the ability to regulate
its body temperature. An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen 
from cold ocean water using its gills. This process cools its blood. Then, heat the tuna generates swimming 
and hunting warms the blood. In most fishes, this heat would be lost
back out into the ocean through the gills. But in the Atlantic bluefin, a mechanism called countercurrent exchange
traps the heat. Cold blood on its way 
to the large swimming muscles passes close to warm blood 
leaving those muscles in a specialized network of blood vessels 
known as a rete mirabile. Here the heat “jumps” to the cold blood
and stays in the body. This makes bluefin one of the few 
warm-blooded fishes, a huge advantage 
in the marine environment. Cold-blooded animals whose 
body temperature depends entirely on the environment become
sluggish in colder waters. But a bluefin’s ability to keep warm
means it has sharper vision, can better process information,
and can swim faster than its prey. It thrives in cold, deep, subarctic water. Thanks to their warm bloodedness, 
their powerful muscles, and their streamlined torpedo shape with fins that fold into grooves 
to reduce drag, bluefin tuna can reach speeds
few other animals can match. Their maximum speed of 40 miles per hour is faster than that of a great white shark
or orca whale, and even at their comfortable 
cruising speed, they can cross the Atlantic
in a couple months. All this swimming requires
a great deal of oxygen, but the bluefin is adapted
for this as well. The faster it swims, the more water
passes over its gills, and the more oxygen it can absorb
from that water. This need for a constant flow of water means the tuna must always remain 
on the move. It also means bluefin cannot suck prey 
into their mouths the way most other fishes do. Instead, they must chase down 
their prey with their mouths open. They eat smaller prey than most predators
their size, including squid, crustaceans,
and smaller fish species like mackerel. The bluefin’s temperature-regulating
ability doesn’t just make it a superior hunter— 
it gives it nearly unlimited range. As soon as they’re strong enough to swim
against the current, Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters 
of their spawning grounds and spend their lives hunting
all over the Atlantic Ocean. Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Mediterranean Sea frequent the same feeding grounds and range from Brazil and Texas 
to Iceland and Senegal and beyond. But when the time comes
to reproduce around age 10, they always return to their sea of origin. Here, groups of males and females release
millions of eggs and sperm into the water. They’ll migrate back and forth between 
feeding and spawning grounds annually for the rest of their lives. Atlantic bluefin can live 
for over 40 years, growing all the while. The largest specimens are tens of millions
of times heavier than when they hatched. The same huge size that makes
bluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean has made them vulnerable
to one predator in particular: us. Humans have a long history
of fishing Atlantic bluefin— it’s even stamped on ancient Greek coins. But in recent decades, 
demand has skyrocketed as bluefin are hunted for sashimi, sushi, 
and tuna steaks. An individual fish can sell 
for $10,000 or more, promoting overfishing and illegal fishing. But if recent conservation efforts are
redoubled and quotas are better enforced, bluefin populations can begin to recover.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 10. 

Although Question 10 does not directly ask for the maximum speed of the Atlantic bluefin tuna, it does compare the tuna's speed to that of other ocean predators and states the correct relationship (i.e., the tuna is faster than both a great white shark and an orca whale). The ground truth MCQ states that the maximum speed of the Atlantic bluefin tuna is 40 miles per hour, which is faster than both a great white shark and an orca whale, as mentioned in the transcript.

However, none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the maximum speed of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. If you'd like, I can try to suggest a modification to one of the generated MCQs to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What’s as big as a polar bear, 
swallows its prey whole, and swims at 40 miles an hour? It’s not a shark or a killer whale. It’s the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The largest and longest-lived
of the 15 tuna species, the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set
of adaptations that make it one of the most dominant 
predators in the ocean. It starts as a tiny hatchling in the 
Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea, no bigger than a human eyelash. Within its first year of life, It develops something known as 
regional endothermy— the ability to regulate
its body temperature. An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen 
from cold ocean water using its gills. This process cools its blood. Then, heat the tuna generates swimming 
and hunting warms the blood. In most fishes, this heat would be lost
back out into the ocean through the gills. But in the Atlantic bluefin, a mechanism called countercurrent exchange
traps the heat. Cold blood on its way 
to the large swimming muscles passes close to warm blood 
leaving those muscles in a specialized network of blood vessels 
known as a rete mirabile. Here the heat “jumps” to the cold blood
and stays in the body. This makes bluefin one of the few 
warm-blooded fishes, a huge advantage 
in the marine environment. Cold-blooded animals whose 
body temperature depends entirely on the environment become
sluggish in colder waters. But a bluefin’s ability to keep warm
means it has sharper vision, can better process information,
and can swim faster than its prey. It thrives in cold, deep, subarctic water. Thanks to their warm bloodedness, 
their powerful muscles, and their streamlined torpedo shape with fins that fold into grooves 
to reduce drag, bluefin tuna can reach speeds
few other animals can match. Their maximum speed of 40 miles per hour is faster than that of a great white shark
or orca whale, and even at their comfortable 
cruising speed, they can cross the Atlantic
in a couple months. All this swimming requires
a great deal of oxygen, but the bluefin is adapted
for this as well. The faster it swims, the more water
passes over its gills, and the more oxygen it can absorb
from that water. This need for a constant flow of water means the tuna must always remain 
on the move. It also means bluefin cannot suck prey 
into their mouths the way most other fishes do. Instead, they must chase down 
their prey with their mouths open. They eat smaller prey than most predators
their size, including squid, crustaceans,
and smaller fish species like mackerel. The bluefin’s temperature-regulating
ability doesn’t just make it a superior hunter— 
it gives it nearly unlimited range. As soon as they’re strong enough to swim
against the current, Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters 
of their spawning grounds and spend their lives hunting
all over the Atlantic Ocean. Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Mediterranean Sea frequent the same feeding grounds and range from Brazil and Texas 
to Iceland and Senegal and beyond. But when the time comes
to reproduce around age 10, they always return to their sea of origin. Here, groups of males and females release
millions of eggs and sperm into the water. They’ll migrate back and forth between 
feeding and spawning grounds annually for the rest of their lives. Atlantic bluefin can live 
for over 40 years, growing all the while. The largest specimens are tens of millions
of times heavier than when they hatched. The same huge size that makes
bluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean has made them vulnerable
to one predator in particular: us. Humans have a long history
of fishing Atlantic bluefin— it’s even stamped on ancient Greek coins. But in recent decades, 
demand has skyrocketed as bluefin are hunted for sashimi, sushi,

**Transcript**:
Your eyes get heavy and gradually... 
close... But wait! It’s only lunchtime
and you still have so much to do. Would taking a nap help?
Or would it derail your day? Our sleep, both at night and in naps, is made up of approximately 90 minute
sleep cycles with four stages each. A nap can last anywhere from five minutes
to three hours, so it can include full sleep cycles
or just a few stages. As you fall asleep, you enter Stage 1:
the first two to five minutes of sleep. Stage 2 comes next, for about 30 minutes. In Stage 2, body temperature drops, 
muscles relax, and breathing and heart rate 
become more regular. Your neurons start to fire in unison, creating waves of activity 
that sweep across the cortex, punctuated by rapid bursts 
of neural activity called sleep spindles. As you enter Stage 3,
or slow wave sleep, the rolling waves increase as your neurons
fire in coordination. This phase lasts about 20 to 30 minutes
and is where your deepest sleep occurs. Then, you enter REM sleep, which lasts
about 10 to 20 minutes in a nap. In REM, the brain becomes more active,
more like your brain activity while awake. The end of REM signals 
the completion of a sleep cycle. OK, but will a nap make you feel better? Well, that depends on a few things— especially what stages of sleep
the nap includes. Take a 30 minute nap, 
which consists mainly of Stage 2 sleep. Stage 2 sleep is associated 
with long-term potentiation, a process that's thought to strengthen
the synapses between neurons, which is essential for learning. A 20 to 30 minute nap stops short
of Stage 3′s deep sleep, making it relatively easy to wake up from. A 30 to 60 minute nap, meanwhile,
has the benefits of Stage 2 sleep and also takes you into the deeper sleep 
of Stage 3. During Stage 3, multiple brain areas
work together to transfer information from short-term memory storage
to long-term storage, stabilizing and strengthening 
long-term memory by coupling sleep spindles 
with slow waves. Stage 3 is the most difficult stage 
to wake up from. So while a 30 to 60 minute nap
can have cognitive benefits, those benefits often don’t kick in until 
about 15 minutes after waking up. 60 to 90 minute naps enter the REM stage. While in REM, the prefrontal cortex, which is largely responsible 
for inhibition and cognitive control, becomes much less active. Meanwhile, the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex, regions associated with emotion 
and motivation, are highly active. Researchers have posited that 
the combination of these things leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep: the decrease in inhibition and cognitive
control might lead to wild associations— and, thanks to the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex activity, those associations can be 
between emotionally charged topics. Some researchers think this stage might
help us make innovative connections between ideas upon waking. Because the brain activity during
REM is closer to waking, it may be easier to wake up from REM 
than Stage 3, even though the nap is longer. The time of day also matters. Our need for deep Stage 3 sleep 
progressively increases throughout the day. So if you nap later, you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure
needed to go to sleep at night. This doesn't happen for REM sleep. Longer periods of REM occur
during morning hours, so morning naps are dominated by REM, midday naps have about equal parts
of REM and deep sleep, and evening naps contain more deep sleep. On top of all this, it seems 
that we’re just about evenly split between nappers and non-nappers. Nappers consistently show
cognitive benefits from napping, but non-nappers may not. Researchers think this could be 
because nappers are able to stay in a lighter sleep
and move through sleep stages more easily. Meanwhile, non-nappers may experience
more deep sleep while napping, making them groggy afterward. So will a nap help? Well, there’s only one way to find out...

of neural activity called sleep spindles. As you enter Stage 3,
or slow wave sleep, the rolling waves increase as your neurons
fire in coordination. This phase lasts about 20 to 30 minutes
and is where your deepest sleep occurs. Then, you enter REM sleep, which lasts
about 10 to 20 minutes in a nap. In REM, the brain becomes more active,
more like your brain activity while awake. The end of REM signals 
the completion of a sleep cycle. OK, but will a nap make you feel better? Well, that depends on a few things— especially what stages of sleep
the nap includes. Take a 30 minute nap, 
which consists mainly of Stage 2 sleep. Stage 2 sleep is associated 
with long-term potentiation, a process that's thought to strengthen
the synapses between neurons, which is essential for learning. A 20 to 30 minute nap stops short
of Stage 3′s deep sleep, making it relatively easy to wake up from. A 30 to 60 minute nap, meanwhile,
has the benefits of Stage 2 sleep and also takes you into the deeper sleep 
of Stage 3. During Stage 3, multiple brain areas
work together to transfer information from short-term memory storage
to long-term storage, stabilizing and strengthening 
long-term memory by coupling sleep spindles 
with slow waves. Stage 3 is the most difficult stage 
to wake up from. So while a 30 to 60 minute nap
can have cognitive benefits, those benefits often don’t kick in until 
about 15 minutes after waking up. 60 to 90 minute naps enter the REM stage. While in REM, the prefrontal cortex, which is largely responsible 
for inhibition and cognitive control, becomes much less active. Meanwhile, the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex, regions associated with emotion 
and motivation, are highly active. Researchers have posited that 
the combination of these things leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep: the decrease in inhibition and cognitive
control might lead to wild associations— and, thanks to the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex activity, those associations can be 
between emotionally charged topics. Some researchers think this stage might
help us make innovative connections between ideas upon waking. Because the brain activity during
REM is closer to waking, it may be easier to wake up from REM 
than Stage 3, even though the nap is longer. The time of day also matters. Our need for deep Stage 3 sleep 
progressively increases throughout the day. So if you nap later, you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure
needed to go to sleep at night. This doesn't happen for REM sleep. Longer periods of REM occur
during morning hours, so morning naps are dominated by REM, midday naps have about equal parts
of REM and deep sleep, and evening naps contain more deep sleep. On top of all this, it seems 
that we’re just about evenly split between nappers and non-nappers. Nappers consistently show
cognitive benefits from napping, but non-nappers may not. Researchers think this could be 
because nappers are able to stay in a lighter sleep
and move through sleep stages more easily. Meanwhile, non-nappers may experience
more deep sleep while napping, making them groggy afterward. So will a nap help? Well, there’s only one way to find out...

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the wording of the ground truth MCQ, its content and options are closely related to the concept of sleep spindles and their function during Stage 2 sleep, which is associated with long-term potentiation. 

However, a more precise match can be found in Question 2, which directly addresses the stage of sleep associated with long-term potentiation, and Question 5, which addresses the primary function of sleep spindles. 

But the most similar question is Question 5 because it specifically mentions sleep spindles, which is the main concept of the ground truth MCQ.

Your eyes get heavy and gradually... 
close... But wait! It’s only lunchtime
and you still have so much to do. Would taking a nap help?
Or would it derail your day? Our sleep, both at night and in naps, is made up of approximately 90 minute
sleep cycles with four stages each. A nap can last anywhere from five minutes
to three hours, so it can include full sleep cycles
or just a few stages. As you fall asleep, you enter Stage 1:
the first two to five minutes of sleep. Stage 2 comes next, for about 30 minutes. In Stage 2, body temperature drops, 
muscles relax, and breathing and heart rate 
become more regular. Your neurons start to fire in unison, creating waves of activity

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6, but it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 6 is the closest match because it mentions REM sleep and a cognitive benefit associated with it.

However, a more careful examination reveals that Question 3 is a better match in terms of the specific details mentioned in the ground truth MCQ. Question 3 mentions that brain activity during REM sleep becomes more active, similar to brain activity while awake.

But the best match is actually none of the above questions because they do not specifically mention the amygdala, cingulate cortex, and prefrontal cortex. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is not the best match, but Question 3 is not a perfect match either.

Since the questions do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I will choose the one that talks about the brain activity during REM sleep.

three hexagons together, they could reinvent the world
however they saw fit. That was thousands of years ago. Today, you’ve learned of Gordon, an evil 
wizard dead set on collecting the hexagons and enslaving the world to his will. So you set off on a quest 
to get them first, adventuring through fire, ice, and sand. Yet each time, you find that someone else 
got there first. Not Gordon, but a merchant named Dongle. At the end of the third dungeon. you find
a note inviting you to Dongle’s castle. You show up with a wallet bursting 
with the 99 gems you’ve collected in your travels, arriving just moments before Gordon, 
who also has 99 gems. Dongle has not only collected 
the golden hexagons, but he’s used them to create 
5 silver hexagons, just as powerful 
as their golden counterparts. Why did Dongle do all this? Because there’s one thing he loves
above all else: auctions. You and the evil wizard will compete
to win the hexagons, starting with the three golden ones, making one bid for each item 
as it comes up. The winners of ties will alternate, 
starting with you. Whoever first collects a trio 
of either golden or silver hexagons can use their power to recreate the world. You’ve already bid 24 gems on the first, when you realize that your rival
has a dastardly advantage: a mirror that lets him see
what you’re bidding. He bids zero, 
and you win the first hexagon outright. What’s your strategy to win a matching
trio of hexagons before your rival? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Dongle’s dangled a difficult dilemma. Do you spend big to try to win 
the golden hexagons outright? Save as much as possible for silver?
Or something in-between? Gordon can use his magic mirror 
and 99 gems to make sure that no matter what you bid 
on the second gold, he can bid one more and block you. So the real question is— how can you force
Gordon to spend enough on the golds to guarantee that you’ll win
on the silvers? Here’s a hint. Let’s say at the start 
of the silver auctions you had a one gem advantage, 
such as 9 to 8. You need to win three auctions, so could you divide your gems 
into three groups of three and win? For simplicity, let’s assume 
a set of rules that’s worse for you, where Gordon wins every tie. If you bid 3 each time, 
the best he could do is win two silver hexagons, 
and have two gems left— which you’ll beat with
three bids of 3. Any one-gem advantage where your
starting total is divisible by three will lead to victory by the same logic. So knowing that, how can you force
Gordon's hand in the gold auctions so you go into silver with an advantage? Let’s first imagine that Gordon lets 
you win the second gold auction by betting some amount X with a tie. You could then bid everything you have
left on the third gold hexagon, and he'd have to match you to block. So if you could bid 51 on the third gold, you'd go into silver with a 51 to 48
advantage, which you know you can win. Solving for X reveals that in order
to have 51 on round three, you should bid at most 24 on round two. But what about the other possibility, where Gordon wins the second gold 
against your bid of 24— would this strategy still work? The least he could bid to win
the second gold is 25, making the total 75 to Gordon’s 74. No one would then bid on round three, since you’ve each blocked the other 
from getting three golds. After that, you could bid 25 
every time to win three silvers. The bidding war was close, but your ingenuity kept you one link
ahead in the chain of inference, and the silver tri-source is yours. Now... what will you do with it?

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about a scenario where there are only silver hexagons, and player A has 100 gems, while player B has 99 gems. The question asks if either player can be sure to get three silver hexagons before their opponent.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, which discusses a scenario where you have a one-gem advantage at the start of the silver auctions, with 9 gems to Gordon's 8. The question asks how you can divide your gems to guarantee a win.

Although the scenarios are not identical, both questions deal with the strategy of dividing gems to win silver hexagons. However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 5, but with a low confidence level due to the differences in the scenarios.

The ground truth MCQ is about determining the fewest number of gems A would need to have in order to win three hexagons before B does, assuming B wins every tie and starts with 60 gems.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, which discusses dividing gems to guarantee a win in the silver auctions. Although it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it deals with a similar concept of strategizing gem allocation to win hexagons.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that more closely matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 6 is somewhat related, as it discusses the outcome of bidding a certain number of gems in the silver auctions.

got there first. Not Gordon, but a merchant named Dongle. At the end of the third dungeon. you find
a note inviting you to Dongle’s castle. You show up with a wallet bursting 
with the 99 gems you’ve collected in your travels, arriving just moments before Gordon, 
who also has 99 gems. Dongle has not only collected 
the golden hexagons, but he’s used them to create 
5 silver hexagons, just as powerful 
as their golden counterparts. Why did Dongle do all this? Because there’s one thing he loves
above all else: auctions. You and the evil wizard will compete
to win the hexagons, starting with the three golden ones, making one bid for each item 
as it comes up. The winners of ties will alternate, 
starting with you. Whoever first collects a trio 
of either golden or silver hexagons can use their power to recreate the world. You’ve already bid 24 gems on the first, when you realize that your rival
has a dastardly advantage: a mirror that lets him see
what you’re bidding. He bids zero, 
and you win the first hexagon outright. What’s your strategy to win a matching
trio of hexagons before your rival? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Dongle’s dangled a difficult dilemma. Do you spend big to try to win 
the golden hexagons outright? Save as much as possible for silver?
Or something in-between? Gordon can use his magic mirror 
and 99 gems to make sure that no matter what you bid 
on the second gold, he can bid one more and block you. So the real question is— how can you force
Gordon to spend enough on the golds to guarantee that you’ll win
on the silvers? Here’s a hint. Let’s say at the start 
of the silver auctions you had a one gem advantage, 
such as 9 to 8. You need to win three auctions, so could you divide your gems 
into three groups of three and win? For simplicity, let’s assume 
a set of rules that’s worse for you, where Gordon wins every tie. If you bid 3 each time, 
the best he could do is win two silver hexagons, 
and have two gems left— which you’ll beat with
three bids of 3. Any one-gem advantage where your
starting total is divisible by three will lead to victory by the same logic. So knowing that, how can you force

you win the second gold auction by betting some amount X with a tie. You could then bid everything you have
left on the third gold hexagon, and he'd have to match you to block. So if you could bid 51 on the third gold, you'd go into silver with a 51 to 48

to have 51 on round three, you should bid at most 24 on round two. But what about the other possibility, where Gordon wins the second gold 
against your bid of 24— would this strategy still work? The least he could bid to win
the second gold is 25, making the total 75 to Gordon’s 74. No one would then bid on round three, since you’ve each blocked the other 
from getting three golds. After that, you could bid 25

**Transcript**:
According to legend, 
when this planet was young and molten, three galactic terraformers
shaped it into a paradise. When their work was done, 
they sought out new worlds, but left the source of their power behind: three powerful golden hexagons, hidden within dungeons 
full of traps and monsters. If one person were to bring all
three hexagons together, they could reinvent the world
however they saw fit. That was thousands of years ago. Today, you’ve learned of Gordon, an evil 
wizard dead set on collecting the hexagons and enslaving the world to his will. So you set off on a quest 
to get them first, adventuring through fire, ice, and sand. Yet each time, you find that someone else 
got there first. Not Gordon, but a merchant named Dongle. At the end of the third dungeon. you find
a note inviting you to Dongle’s castle. You show up with a wallet bursting 
with the 99 gems you’ve collected in your travels, arriving just moments before Gordon, 
who also has 99 gems. Dongle has not only collected 
the golden hexagons, but he’s used them to create 
5 silver hexagons, just as powerful 
as their golden counterparts. Why did Dongle do all this? Because there’s one thing he loves
above all else: auctions. You and the evil wizard will compete
to win the hexagons, starting with the three golden ones, making one bid for each item 
as it comes up. The winners of ties will alternate, 
starting with you. Whoever first collects a trio 
of either golden or silver hexagons can use their power to recreate the world. You’ve already bid 24 gems on the first, when you realize that your rival
has a dastardly advantage: a mirror that lets him see
what you’re bidding. He bids zero, 
and you win the first hexagon outright. What’s your strategy to win a matching
trio of hexagons before your rival? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Dongle’s dangled a difficult dilemma. Do you spend big to try to win 
the golden hexagons outright? Save as much as possible for silver?
Or something in-between? Gordon can use his magic mirror 
and 99 gems to make sure that no matter what you bid 
on the second gold, he can bid one more and block you. So the real question is— how can you force
Gordon to spend enough on the golds to guarantee that you’ll win
on the silvers? Here’s a hint. Let’s say at the start 
of the silver auctions you had a one gem advantage, 
such as 9 to 8. You need to win three auctions, so could you divide your gems 
into three groups of three and win? For simplicity, let’s assume 
a set of rules that’s worse for you, where Gordon wins every tie. If you bid 3 each time, 
the best he could do is win two silver hexagons, 
and have two gems left— which you’ll beat with
three bids of 3. Any one-gem advantage where your
starting total is divisible by three will lead to victory by the same logic. So knowing that, how can you force
Gordon's hand in the gold auctions so you go into silver with an advantage? Let’s first imagine that Gordon lets 
you win the second gold auction by betting some amount X with a tie. You could then bid everything you have
left on the third gold hexagon, and he'd have to match you to block. So if you could bid 51 on the third gold, you'd go into silver with a 51 to 48
advantage, which you know you can win. Solving for X reveals that in order
to have 51 on round three, you should bid at most 24 on round two. But what about the other possibility, where Gordon wins the second gold 
against your bid of 24— would this strategy still work? The least he could bid to win
the second gold is 25, making the total 75 to Gordon’s 74. No one would then bid on round three, since you’ve each blocked the other 
from getting three golds. After that, you could bid 25 
every time to win three silvers. The bidding war was close, but your ingenuity kept you one link
ahead in the chain of inference, and the silver tri-source is yours. Now... what will you do with it?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 7. 

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and strategy discussed in Question 7 are closely related to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions deal with the idea of forcing Gordon's hand in the gold auctions to gain an advantage in the silver auctions. The correct option in Question 7 (B. Bid at most 24 on the second gold hexagon) is also similar to the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (B. 15 is not an exact match, but the idea of bidding a specific amount on the second gold hexagon to gain an advantage is present in both questions).

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and intent. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the overall story and strategy, while the ground truth MCQ presents a specific scenario with different numbers and conditions.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to It Hurts! One of these creatures is thought 
to possess the world’s most painful insect sting. If you were to guess, would it be: the ant that forages 
in rainforest canopies? The bee that protects a hive
of delectable honey? Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas? Let’s find out! Ant, bee, and wasp venoms contain 
a variable cocktail of compounds designed to incite unsavory sensations 
and even compromise bodily functions. Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt’s 
sting pain index describes and ranks the pain 
of around 100 kinds of insect stings. One of our three competitors
claims the nastiest one. First, let’s consider 
the Western honeybee’s sting, Schmidt says it’s like “a flaming 
match head has landed on your arm and is quenched first with lye 
and then sulfuric acid.” This discomfort is accomplished with venom that’s packed with a pain-causing 
peptide called “melittin” and flesh-softening enzymes
that disperse the venom. These enzymes may also cause 
allergic reactions and even lead to fluid buildup 
in the lungs. Because worker honeybees have barbed 
stingers that burrow into certain victims, they usually can't sting without leaving
part of their bodies behind, which ultimately kills them. Since only the queen bee has 
the ability to reproduce, a worker bee’s self-sacrifice helps 
ensure that the colony— and their genes— will prevail. But before they go, they release an alarm pheromone
that activates a mass attack and often targets some of the most 
vulnerable sites on their victim’s body. The tarantula hawk wasp sting is, 
as Schmidt says, “blinding, fierce, shockingly electric ...
A bolt out of the heavens. Lie down and scream.” The sensation might last just 5
agonizing minutes for humans, but it leaves tarantulas— the wasp’s
preferred target— permanently paralyzed. After the wasp stings a tarantula, 
aiming for a crucial bundle of nerves, it lays an egg on the immobilized spider. Once hatched, the wasp’s larva spends
its formative days in the bountiful environment 
of the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem
to do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider 
as fresh meat for the wasp’s offspring. The rainforest-dwelling bullet ant’s sting
yields “pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over a flaming bed 
of charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded 
in your heel,” according to Schmidt. And this torture
often lasts more than 12 hours. A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin that our bodies struggle to degrade 
is what makes the pain last so long. In addition to agony, poneratoxin can 
induce trembling, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, 
and even an abnormal heartbeat. The bullet ant is, in fact, crowned 
with the most painful insect sting. It's thought that they may have evolved
such an excruciating defense because they forage in rainforest canopies
loaded with predators looking for proteinaceous snacks. They can’t simply jump or fly away, so perhaps they’re better off with this
reliable, rather off-putting weapon. The tarantula hawk wasp’s formidable sting clocks in as the second most painful 
on the scale. And it’s likely the reason this wasp 
has no known predators. Honeybee stings are in the middle 
of the pain scale. But when many sting simultaneously, what might’ve felt manageable at first
becomes all the more dangerous. In fact, insect stings helped enable
the evolution of complex colonies that would otherwise represent
an easy feast to predators. Some stinging insects are, of course,
more aggressive than others, but most of the time, they only sting us 
when we provoke them. The truth hurts.

of the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem
to do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider 
as fresh meat for the wasp’s offspring. The rainforest-dwelling bullet ant’s sting
yields “pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over a flaming bed 
of charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded 
in your heel,” according to Schmidt. And this torture
often lasts more than 12 hours. A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin that our bodies struggle to degrade 
is what makes the pain last so long. In addition to agony, poneratoxin can 
induce trembling, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, 
and even an abnormal heartbeat. The bullet ant is, in fact, crowned 
with the most painful insect sting. It's thought that they may have evolved
such an excruciating defense because they forage in rainforest canopies
loaded with predators looking for proteinaceous snacks. They can’t simply jump or fly away, so perhaps they’re better off with this
reliable, rather off-putting weapon. The tarantula hawk wasp’s formidable sting clocks in as the second most painful 
on the scale. And it’s likely the reason this wasp 
has no known predators. Honeybee stings are in the middle 
of the pain scale. But when many sting simultaneously, what might’ve felt manageable at first
becomes all the more dangerous. In fact, insect stings helped enable
the evolution of complex colonies that would otherwise represent
an easy feast to predators. Some stinging insects are, of course,
more aggressive than others, but most of the time, they only sting us 
when we provoke them. The truth hurts.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to It Hurts! One of these creatures is thought 
to possess the world’s most painful insect sting. If you were to guess, would it be: the ant that forages 
in rainforest canopies? The bee that protects a hive
of delectable honey? Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas? Let’s find out! Ant, bee, and wasp venoms contain 
a variable cocktail of compounds designed to incite unsavory sensations 
and even compromise bodily functions. Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt’s 
sting pain index describes and ranks the pain 
of around 100 kinds of insect stings. One of our three competitors
claims the nastiest one. First, let’s consider 
the Western honeybee’s sting, Schmidt says it’s like “a flaming 
match head has landed on your arm and is quenched first with lye 
and then sulfuric acid.” This discomfort is accomplished with venom that’s packed with a pain-causing 
peptide called “melittin” and flesh-softening enzymes
that disperse the venom. These enzymes may also cause 
allergic reactions and even lead to fluid buildup 
in the lungs. Because worker honeybees have barbed 
stingers that burrow into certain victims, they usually can't sting without leaving
part of their bodies behind, which ultimately kills them. Since only the queen bee has 
the ability to reproduce, a worker bee’s self-sacrifice helps 
ensure that the colony— and their genes— will prevail. But before they go, they release an alarm pheromone
that activates a mass attack and often targets some of the most 
vulnerable sites on their victim’s body. The tarantula hawk wasp sting is, 
as Schmidt says, “blinding, fierce, shockingly electric ...
A bolt out of the heavens. Lie down and scream.” The sensation might last just 5
agonizing minutes for humans, but it leaves tarantulas— the wasp’s
preferred target— permanently paralyzed. After the wasp stings a tarantula, 
aiming for a crucial bundle of nerves, it lays an egg on the immobilized spider. Once hatched, the wasp’s larva spends
its formative days in the bountiful environment 
of the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem
to do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider

**Question 1: Which of the following insects is thought to possess the world's most painful insect sting? Options: A. Western honeybee, B. Tarantula hawk wasp, C. Bullet ant, D. Fire ant Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the most painful insect sting, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the insect sting that is in the middle of the stinging insect pain scale.

A closer match would be a question that asks about the relative ranking of the honeybee's sting. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

**None of the questions exactly match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of mentioning the ranking of an insect's sting: What is the likely reason why tarantula hawk wasps have no known predators?

**Transcript**:
After stalking an unsuspecting cuttlefish
across the seafloor, this moray eel is finally ready to pounce. As the eel snags the mollusk
in its long teeth, its prey struggles to escape. But before it can wriggle away, a second set of teeth lunge
from the eel's throat, making short work of the captive
cuttlefish. This adaptation is called
a pharyngeal jaw. And while it might seem more fitting
for an alien parasite than a fish, it's actually one of the most common
adaptations under the sea. At some point millions of years ago, early fish evolved a jointed oral jaw
from one of the bony arches that supported their frontal gills. This exterior, oral jaw was perfect
for capturing or chewing prey, but these early fish had a problem. They had no limbs to manipulate food
while eating, making it easy for their mobile prey
to escape before they took the first bite. Essentially, it was impossible for fish
to capture and chew their prey at the same time with just one set
of jaws. So to hold their food and eat it too, an even deeper gill arch evolved
into a secondary set of jaws. Unlike oral jaws connected
by a bone joint, these pharyngeal jaws were suspended
in muscle, offering them a wide range of motion
to turn, tug, and tear on food. Some pharyngeal jaws actively chew, while others retract to pull chunks
of food down the throat. Of course, the teeth a jaw has
also factor in here. For example, an oral jaw with fangs
is exceptional for catching and holding on to fast-moving prey. But depending on what that prey is, a fish might want sharp pharyngeal teeth
to tear through tissue, flat pharyngeal molars to grind
plant matter, or a powerful pharyngeal bite
to crush shelled prey. Fortunately some fishes can change
their secondary teeth to match a new diet over several years. This flexibility allows fish to adapt and find food in a huge variety
of aquatic environments. Some pharyngeal jaws have formed
to eat food too hard for most fishes. California Sheephead use pointed teeth
from their oral jaws to pry urchins off rocks before crushing
their spiny exteriors in strong pharyngeal jaws that have fused
with the bones of their skulls. Other fish prioritize eating
huge quantities of food. The pharyngeal jaws of grass carp
have two bone components that move in unison to pull plant life
into their stomachs, consuming over 18 kilograms
of seaweed a day. Other pharyngeal jaws are adapted
to suit incredibly specific circumstances. Consider this species of pearlfish that
lives inside sea cucumbers and feeds on their guts. Fish are the most diverse group
of vertebrates with over 30,000 unique species, and much of that diversity is due
to the hundreds of unique jaws separating otherwise identical species. Perhaps the best example of this
dental diversity can be seen in cichlids. This family of fish is primarily found in
select African and South American lakes. Typically, large lakes like these
would be occupied by a handful of distantly related species, each adapted to consume one
of the lake's limited food sources. But here, almost every corner
of the ecosystem is occupied by a different species
of cichlid. There are over 1,700 cichlid species, many almost identical save
for their uniquely adapted jaws which have evolved to eat crustaceans,
mollusks, worms, algae, plankton, and even the scales of other fish. These oral adaptations are so essential
for survival, that different species use their
pharyngeal jaws to make unique mating sounds that allow female cichlids to identify
males of their own species. This technique limits
interspecies breeding, and ensures the parent fish will
pass on their specialized jaws. Scientists are still discovering
all the ways this incredible skeletal mechanism
functions. But given what we know already,
it's fair to say that for most fish, two jaws are better than one.

**Transcript**:
After stalking an unsuspecting cuttlefish
across the seafloor, this moray eel is finally ready to pounce. As the eel snags the mollusk
in its long teeth, its prey struggles to escape. But before it can wriggle away, a second set of teeth lunge
from the eel's throat, making short work of the captive
cuttlefish. This adaptation is called
a pharyngeal jaw. And while it might seem more fitting
for an alien parasite than a fish, it's actually one of the most common
adaptations under the sea. At some point millions of years ago, early fish evolved a jointed oral jaw
from one of the bony arches that supported their frontal gills. This exterior, oral jaw was perfect
for capturing or chewing prey, but these early fish had a problem. They had no limbs to manipulate food
while eating, making it easy for their mobile prey
to escape before they took the first bite. Essentially, it was impossible for fish
to capture and chew their prey at the same time with just one set
of jaws. So to hold their food and eat it too, an even deeper gill arch evolved
into a secondary set of jaws. Unlike oral jaws connected
by a bone joint, these pharyngeal jaws were suspended
in muscle, offering them a wide range of motion
to turn, tug, and tear on food. Some pharyngeal jaws actively chew, while others retract to pull chunks
of food down the throat. Of course, the teeth a jaw has
also factor in here. For example, an oral jaw with fangs
is exceptional for catching and holding on to fast-moving prey. But depending on what that prey is, a fish might want sharp pharyngeal teeth
to tear through tissue, flat pharyngeal molars to grind
plant matter, or a powerful pharyngeal bite
to crush shelled prey. Fortunately some fishes can change
their secondary teeth to match a new diet over several years. This flexibility allows fish to adapt and find food in a huge variety
of aquatic environments. Some pharyngeal jaws have formed
to eat food too hard for most fishes. California Sheephead use pointed teeth
from their oral jaws to pry urchins off rocks before crushing
their spiny exteriors in strong pharyngeal jaws that have fused
with the bones of their skulls. Other fish prioritize eating
huge quantities of food. The pharyngeal jaws of grass carp
have two bone components that move in unison to pull plant life
into their stomachs, consuming over 18 kilograms
of seaweed a day. Other pharyngeal jaws are adapted
to suit incredibly specific circumstances. Consider this species of pearlfish that
lives inside sea cucumbers and feeds on their guts. Fish are the most diverse group
of vertebrates with over 30,000 unique species, and much of that diversity is due
to the hundreds of unique jaws separating otherwise identical species. Perhaps the best example of this
dental diversity can be seen in cichlids. This family of fish is primarily found in
select African and South American lakes. Typically, large lakes like these
would be occupied by a handful of distantly related species, each adapted to consume one
of the lake's limited food sources. But here, almost every corner
of the ecosystem is occupied by a different species
of cichlid. There are over 1,700 cichlid species, many almost identical save
for their uniquely adapted jaws which have evolved to eat crustaceans,
mollusks, worms, algae, plankton, and even the scales of other fish. These oral adaptations are so essential
for survival, that different species use their
pharyngeal jaws to make unique mating sounds that allow female cichlids to identify
males of their own species. This technique limits
interspecies breeding, and ensures the parent fish will
pass on their specialized jaws. Scientists are still discovering
all the ways this incredible skeletal mechanism
functions. But given what we know already,
it's fair to say that for most fish, two jaws are better than one.

**Transcript**:
If you look closely at this pack of
riders in the Tour de France, you'll see some of the best cyclists in the world.
They're here in the back. They're keeping up but also resting while their teammates in the front do most of the work. It's a technique called drafting
and it's what helps them survive the three-week race around France. But
drafting only really makes a difference on these parts of the route: the long
flat and hilly stages. Eventually these riders reach stages where they won't be
able to rely on others. They have to rely on their own strength and endurance to
win the race. That happens here on the climbs. They're the most brutal and
exciting parts of the race and they're what makes the Tour de France the most
famous bike ride in the world... The Tour de France began as a desperate
ploy to sell more copies of the sports newspaper, L'Auto. The paper was
struggling, so 1903 its editor, Henri Desgranges organized a 19 day, 2,400
kilometer bike race around the country. It went on to become such a success that
L'Auto made it an annual event. Year after year they added new routes to make the
tour more challenging and also more interesting for people to follow. By 1908,
L'Auto's sales had more than doubled. Then in 1910, one of Desgranges' writers,
Alphonse Steines, suggested adding a new twist to the route: the Tourmalet. It was a
brutal 19 kilometer uphill climb ascending 1400 meters to the
summit. To see if this was even possible Steines jumped in his car to make the
climb. He drove up, but his car got stuck in the snow at the top,
he suffered from hypothermia and nearly died. But nonetheless he sent a telegram
saying: Tourmalet crossed. Very good road. perfectly passable. So the Tourmalet made its debut in the 1910 Tour. French cyclist Octave Lapize was the first to
make the climb successfully. But he had to walk up some parts and famously
called officials assassins when he reached the summit. But he went on to win the whole tour and his statue was placed at the top of the Tourmalet. Since then,
climbs became a staple of the Tour de France. This year the route is made up of
21 stages over 23 days. It features 30 major climbs; seven of them are in the
tour's most difficult category. Including the Tourmalet, which is part of
the event for the 86th time. More than any other climb in the Tour's history.
These climbs are where the tour is ultimately won or lost. These are the
long, flat, and hilly stages that are usually about 200 kilometers long.
Here cyclists ride together in a formation, called a peloton. It allows
cyclists to save energy by sitting behind another rider or drafting. At high
speeds, riders use most of their energy to pedal against wind resistance. But
when a rider stays close behind another, they're sheltered from much of that. So,
pedaling becomes much easier and they can keep up with the front riders. The
way to measure this is to look at how much power a cyclist generates. Here at
the front of the peloton, a Tour de France rider will generate at least 300
watts of power. I jumped on a bike to see what that feels like and just two
kilometers holding 300 watts was really really hard. By comparison when a rider
is behind the lead in the peloton, they only need to generate about 240 watts to
move at the same speed. Holding 240 watts for two kilometers felt remarkably
easier. So even though these two might finish a 200 kilometer flat stage at the
same time, one is going to be way less tired than the other. That's why you see
some of the tour's best riders here in the back. They're drafting up their
teammates whose job it is to do the hard work now so that the team's best cyclist
is rested for the most difficult part; the mountains. Where they'll have to be
on their own. When the peloton starts pedaling uphill,
it slows down. At this stage the race is less about fighting wind resistance and
more about gravity, which affects all riders the same way in the peloton. So,
now every rider in the front and the back needs to generate an extraordinary
amount of power to keep up pace. In 2010 for instance, Danish cyclist Chris Anker
Sorensen made it to the front of the pack on the Tourmalet climb. "Look at the
face on Chris Anker Sorenesen. Dishing out the pain at the front end. As the lead, he
dictated the pace of the whole group. This chart shows his power output on the
final climb. He averaged 415 watts for more than 11 minutes. "...face of Chris Anker Sorensen now, really dishing out the pain. And around here he peaked at an
incredible 590 watts. "magnificent riding by Chris Anker Sorenson, but how long can he keep this up? "Now look at American cyclist Chris Horner. Even though he was several
positions behind Sorenson, his power output was almost the same. The faster
Sorenson climbed, the harder it was for the rest of the peloton to keep up. And
so the formation started to break up as weaker riders fell behind. This is the
moment in the race when the tour's best riders switch from drafting to relying
on their own strength to get ahead. Andy Schleck has finally attacked and Alberto Contador has gone with him. The race is breaking up behind them like two of the best riders here: Luxembourgian Andy Schleck and Spaniard Alberto Contador, who were coasting in the back of the peloton during the long flat
stages. But here they are halfway up the Tourmalet, breaking away for the win. each likely generating well over 400 watts for the final eight kilometers. Contador
in the yellow jersey, was the overall Tour de France leader but only by eight
seconds. In second place was Schleck, who would try and lose him on this climb. "Andy Schleck is riding like a man possessed" It was neck-and-neck to the very top... It's Schleck on the right. Contador! Schleck wins! Contador takes second! Schleck edged Contador by a hair at the top of the Tourmalet to win the stage. But since he didn't lose him,
Contador kept his overall lead and went on to win the Tour de France. This kind
of drama is only possible in the mountains and this year's route makes
climbs particularly important. This year's Tour is being called the highest in history because of how many climbs there are over the course of three weeks.
Just one day features seven climbs. Even after more than two weeks in the race,
riders climb to 2,770 meters above sea level where the thin air makes climbing even harder. That's what makes the Tour
de France the most grueling and prestigious race in this sport. The
winner isn't simply the strongest rider but the one who endures the most pain
and ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains.

**Transcript**:
If you look closely at this pack of
riders in the Tour de France, you'll see some of the best cyclists in the world.
They're here in the back. They're keeping up but also resting while their teammates in the front do most of the work. It's a technique called drafting
and it's what helps them survive the three-week race around France. But
drafting only really makes a difference on these parts of the route: the long
flat and hilly stages. Eventually these riders reach stages where they won't be
able to rely on others. They have to rely on their own strength and endurance to
win the race. That happens here on the climbs. They're the most brutal and
exciting parts of the race and they're what makes the Tour de France the most
famous bike ride in the world... The Tour de France began as a desperate
ploy to sell more copies of the sports newspaper, L'Auto. The paper was
struggling, so 1903 its editor, Henri Desgranges organized a 19 day, 2,400
kilometer bike race around the country. It went on to become such a success that
L'Auto made it an annual event. Year after year they added new routes to make the
tour more challenging and also more interesting for people to follow. By 1908,
L'Auto's sales had more than doubled. Then in 1910, one of Desgranges' writers,
Alphonse Steines, suggested adding a new twist to the route: the Tourmalet. It was a
brutal 19 kilometer uphill climb ascending 1400 meters to the
summit. To see if this was even possible Steines jumped in his car to make the
climb. He drove up, but his car got stuck in the snow at the top,
he suffered from hypothermia and nearly died. But nonetheless he sent a telegram
saying: Tourmalet crossed. Very good road. perfectly passable. So the Tourmalet made its debut in the 1910 Tour. French cyclist Octave Lapize was the first to
make the climb successfully. But he had to walk up some parts and famously
called officials assassins when he reached the summit. But he went on to win the whole tour and his statue was placed at the top of the Tourmalet. Since then,
climbs became a staple of the Tour de France. This year the route is made up of
21 stages over 23 days. It features 30 major climbs; seven of them are in the
tour's most difficult category. Including the Tourmalet, which is part of
the event for the 86th time. More than any other climb in the Tour's history.
These climbs are where the tour is ultimately won or lost. These are the
long, flat, and hilly stages that are usually about 200 kilometers long.
Here cyclists ride together in a formation, called a peloton. It allows
cyclists to save energy by sitting behind another rider or drafting. At high
speeds, riders use most of their energy to pedal against wind resistance. But
when a rider stays close behind another, they're sheltered from much of that. So,
pedaling becomes much easier and they can keep up with the front riders. The
way to measure this is to look at how much power a cyclist generates. Here at
the front of the peloton, a Tour de France rider will generate at least 300
watts of power. I jumped on a bike to see what that feels like and just two
kilometers holding 300 watts was really really hard. By comparison when a rider
is behind the lead in the peloton, they only need to generate about 240 watts to
move at the same speed. Holding 240 watts for two kilometers felt remarkably
easier. So even though these two might finish a 200 kilometer flat stage at the
same time, one is going to be way less tired than the other. That's why you see
some of the tour's best riders here in the back. They're drafting up their
teammates whose job it is to do the hard work now so that the team's best cyclist
is rested for the most difficult part; the mountains. Where they'll have to be
on their own. When the peloton starts pedaling uphill,
it slows down. At this stage the race is less about fighting wind resistance and
more about gravity, which affects all riders the same way in the peloton. So,
now every rider in the front and the back needs to generate an extraordinary
amount of power to keep up pace. In 2010 for instance, Danish cyclist Chris Anker
Sorensen made it to the front of the pack on the Tourmalet climb. "Look at the
face on Chris Anker Sorenesen. Dishing out the pain at the front end. As the lead, he
dictated the pace of the whole group. This chart shows his power output on the
final climb. He averaged 415 watts for more than 11 minutes. "...face of Chris Anker Sorensen now, really dishing out the pain. And around here he peaked at an
incredible 590 watts. "magnificent riding by Chris Anker Sorenson, but how long can he keep this up? "Now look at American cyclist Chris Horner. Even though he was several
positions behind Sorenson, his power output was almost the same. The faster
Sorenson climbed, the harder it was for the rest of the peloton to keep up. And
so the formation started to break up as weaker riders fell behind. This is the
moment in the race when the tour's best riders switch from drafting to relying
on their own strength to get ahead. Andy Schleck has finally attacked and Alberto Contador has gone with him. The race is breaking up behind them like two of the best riders here: Luxembourgian Andy Schleck and Spaniard Alberto Contador, who were coasting in the back of the peloton during the long flat
stages. But here they are halfway up the Tourmalet, breaking away for the win. each likely generating well over 400 watts for the final eight kilometers. Contador
in the yellow jersey, was the overall Tour de France leader but only by eight
seconds. In second place was Schleck, who would try and lose him on this climb. "Andy Schleck is riding like a man possessed" It was neck-and-neck to the very top... It's Schleck on the right. Contador! Schleck wins! Contador takes second! Schleck edged Contador by a hair at the top of the Tourmalet to win the stage. But since he didn't lose him,
Contador kept his overall lead and went on to win the Tour de France. This kind
of drama is only possible in the mountains and this year's route makes
climbs particularly important. This year's Tour is being called the highest in history because of how many climbs there are over the course of three weeks.
Just one day features seven climbs. Even after more than two weeks in the race,
riders climb to 2,770 meters above sea level where the thin air makes climbing even harder. That's what makes the Tour
de France the most grueling and prestigious race in this sport. The
winner isn't simply the strongest rider but the one who endures the most pain
and ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains.

**Transcript**:
You and your best friend Bill are 
the greatest bards in the kingdom— but maybe not the brightest. The hit song you performed 
at last night’s fair insulted the king, and now your hours are numbered. Just before your execution, you’re approached by the princess,
who happens to be a big fan. She slips you a pouch containing
two magic, six-sided dice that can land any way you wish. You have no idea how this could possibly
help, but you thank her anyways. As everything goes dark, you both suddenly find yourself standing 
in a deep cavern before a robed figure. It turns out that Death is a connoisseur
of most excellent music. He’s decided to give you a chance 
to escape your fate by beating him at his favorite game: 
life-sized Snakes and Ladders. The cavern has 100 rooms connected 
by passageways as well as— you guessed it—
snakes and ladders. Each turn one of you will roll a die, 
then advance that many rooms. Ending your move at the bottom 
of a ladder means moving up to the top, while ending on a snake’s head
will make you slide down to its tail. Each of you must make your way
through the cavern and reach the exit in fewer turns
than Death himself. Before you can think twice,
your host starts casting his die, and within 6 rolls he’s reached 
the cavern entrance. “Better get moving,” he says. “Oh, and by the way, once one 
of you uses a snake or ladder, it’ll disappear and be inaccessible
to the other.” You have no idea how you can possibly
get lucky enough to win, but then you remember your magic dice. Can you figure out a sequence of rolls
that will get both of you to the exit in 5 or fewer moves each? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The cavern contains many
routes to the exit, and it’s natural to gravitate 
to the ladders that allow you to cover a lot of ground, 
quickly. Like this one— on turn 2 you’d be at 75, but without any further ladder boosts,
you’d need another 5 rolls to get out. Or this one— three ladders get you to 82, but then it would take another 4 rolls
to get around the pesky snake at 88. In fact, there’s no path
that can get you to the exit in 5 moves using exclusively ladders. So where does that leave you? Snakes. It’s counterintuitive to make
moves that take you farther away from your target, but snakes open up a surprising amount 
of opportunities. For instance, these three ladders would
put you a single roll from the exit, but cost too many turns
to reach by ladders. These two are, however, only 5 and 12
rooms from snake tails, respectively. So could you work backwards from those
to find a 5 roll path? There are exactly two 5-turn routes
you might find using these ladders: Ladder snake snake ladder exit, and ladder ladder snake ladder exit. So that’s it, right? 
Unfortunately, no— the two paths share a snake and a ladder, each of which will be unusable after 
the first of you slides and then climbs. You won’t find 5-turn
moves anywhere else, so is one of you doomed? There’s one more possibility to consider: the disappearing ladders and snakes
can impede your progress, but could they also help it? There are two paths to the 94 ladder
that almost work, except for this snake, at exactly the midpoint 
between the two ladders. If Bill were to take that snake 
on his route, you could then get past it 
and up to the exit in just 5 moves. And good news— 
whichever path you choose, one of the 5-roll paths we found
earlier does exactly that without using any 
of your snakes or ladders. So all you need is for Bill to go first
and stick to the plan. You and Bill both reach 
the cavern entrance and climb back into the public square,
to everyone’s surprise. Before the guards can seize you again, you wow the crowd— and king— with a song
about your epic contest with Death.

to the other.” You have no idea how you can possibly
get lucky enough to win, but then you remember your magic dice. Can you figure out a sequence of rolls
that will get both of you to the exit in 5 or fewer moves each? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The cavern contains many
routes to the exit, and it’s natural to gravitate 
to the ladders that allow you to cover a lot of ground, 
quickly. Like this one— on turn 2 you’d be at 75, but without any further ladder boosts,
you’d need another 5 rolls to get out. Or this one— three ladders get you to 82, but then it would take another 4 rolls
to get around the pesky snake at 88. In fact, there’s no path
that can get you to the exit in 5 moves using exclusively ladders. So where does that leave you? Snakes. It’s counterintuitive to make
moves that take you farther away from your target, but snakes open up a surprising amount 
of opportunities. For instance, these three ladders would
put you a single roll from the exit, but cost too many turns
to reach by ladders. These two are, however, only 5 and 12
rooms from snake tails, respectively. So could you work backwards from those
to find a 5 roll path? There are exactly two 5-turn routes
you might find using these ladders: Ladder snake snake ladder exit, and ladder ladder snake ladder exit. So that’s it, right? 
Unfortunately, no— the two paths share a snake and a ladder, each of which will be unusable after 
the first of you slides and then climbs. You won’t find 5-turn
moves anywhere else, so is one of you doomed? There’s one more possibility to consider: the disappearing ladders and snakes
can impede your progress, but could they also help it? There are two paths to the 94 ladder
that almost work, except for this snake, at exactly the midpoint 
between the two ladders. If Bill were to take that snake 
on his route, you could then get past it 
and up to the exit in just 5 moves. And good news— 
whichever path you choose, one of the 5-roll paths we found
earlier does exactly that without using any 
of your snakes or ladders. So all you need is for Bill to go first
and stick to the plan. You and Bill both reach 
the cavern entrance and climb back into the public square,

**Transcript**:
You and your best friend Bill are 
the greatest bards in the kingdom— but maybe not the brightest. The hit song you performed 
at last night’s fair insulted the king, and now your hours are numbered. Just before your execution, you’re approached by the princess,
who happens to be a big fan. She slips you a pouch containing
two magic, six-sided dice that can land any way you wish. You have no idea how this could possibly
help, but you thank her anyways. As everything goes dark, you both suddenly find yourself standing 
in a deep cavern before a robed figure. It turns out that Death is a connoisseur
of most excellent music. He’s decided to give you a chance 
to escape your fate by beating him at his favorite game: 
life-sized Snakes and Ladders. The cavern has 100 rooms connected 
by passageways as well as— you guessed it—
snakes and ladders. Each turn one of you will roll a die, 
then advance that many rooms. Ending your move at the bottom 
of a ladder means moving up to the top, while ending on a snake’s head
will make you slide down to its tail. Each of you must make your way
through the cavern and reach the exit in fewer turns
than Death himself. Before you can think twice,
your host starts casting his die, and within 6 rolls he’s reached 
the cavern entrance. “Better get moving,” he says. “Oh, and by the way, once one

**Transcript**:
In 1864, French zoologist August Duméril was baffled while investigating 
the axolotl. Unlike many other amphibians,
which transform into terrestrial adults, axolotls retain their juvenile
characteristics and never leave the water. In an attempt to induce metamorphosis, Duméril spent months removing their gills. But in most instances, the axolotls
simply... grew them back. Indeed, axolotls are masters
of regeneration: they can flawlessly regenerate body parts ranging from amputated limbs and crushed 
spines to parts of their eyes and brains. So how do they do it? 
And what other secrets are they keeping? This extraordinary salamander is native
to the wetlands in Mexico City. Ancient Aztec people considered it 
the incarnation of a God named Xolotl— hence the axolotl’s name, 
roughly meaning “water monster.” Axolotls reach sexual maturity with gills 
and a tadpole-like dorsal fin. Scientists think their forever-young 
condition, called “neoteny,” evolved because of their stable habitat. For salamanders that develop in waters
that dry up, efficiently transitioning to land 
is essential. But the lakes axolotls evolved 
in were unchanging year-round and didn't host many aquatic predators. So, scientists think it was advantageous
for axolotls to forgo the demands of metamorphosis. However,
they haven’t completely lost this ability. If exposed to certain substances,
axolotls will turn into adults. But they’ll often experience
shorter lifespans and lose some of their self-healing 
abilities. These regenerative talents may seem like
crazy superpowers to begin with, but axolotls have good use for them. As babies, they’re in direct competition. So, they snack on each other. This is usually not a huge problem 
thanks to how quickly they can regenerate body parts. When an axolotl loses a limb, tissues
stimulate growth in the area. Skin cells divide and cover the wound. Then, progenitor cells, which can develop
into various bodily tissues, form a mass at the site of injury and nearby nerves secrete 
growth-promoting proteins. Over the next few weeks, 
a new limb emerges as cells proliferate and differentiate 
in coordination. This process could potentially lead to
uncontrolled growth and tumor formation. But axolotls are remarkably
resistant to cancer. They have a system in place that tightly
controls cellular proliferation. To better understand the axolotl’s 
baffling biology, scientists sequenced its genome. They found it to be more than ten times
longer than a human’s. Mutations can change the length
of any animal’s genome. For whatever reason, salamanders have
much more DNA than other vertebrates because they lose parts
of it less frequently. Investigating the axolotl’s genome,
scientists saw many repeated sequences, most of which don't code for proteins
and have no known function. They also found genes 
that are key in regeneration. However, the biggest factor that sets
axolotl regeneration apart may not be a set of unique genes, 
but how they regulate their genes. It’s no wonder that axolotls are one
of science’s most studied animals. But their population in the wild 
has plummeted. Hundreds of years ago, axolotls thrived
under the Aztec capital. Within the surrounding lakes, Aztec people built islands called
chinampas for growing crops. This highly productive form of agriculture
created a vast system of canals, expanding the lake system’s 
shallow, sheltered habitat— the axolotls’ ideal environment. But when Spanish invaders arrived,
they began draining the lakes. And even more water has been
diverted in recent years. Today, the entire population of wild
axolotls is found in just one place, Lake Xochimilco, where it’s threatened
by pollution and invasive fishes. People are working to regenerate
the ecosystem and strengthen the 2,000 year old 
chinampa farming tradition. If interest grows, farmers could recover
abandoned chinampas and support the local community—
along with the axolotl. Eventually, the benefits of saving 
this salamander might be even greater. Scientists hope that one day
we’ll be able to apply the axolotl’s masterful tumor suppression
and regenerative abilities to the human body. Perhaps its secrets are the real reason 
for the slimy god monster’s smile.

**Transcript**:
In 1864, French zoologist August Duméril was baffled while investigating 
the axolotl. Unlike many other amphibians,
which transform into terrestrial adults, axolotls retain their juvenile
characteristics and never leave the water. In an attempt to induce metamorphosis, Duméril spent months removing their gills. But in most instances, the axolotls
simply... grew them back. Indeed, axolotls are masters
of regeneration: they can flawlessly regenerate body parts ranging from amputated limbs and crushed 
spines to parts of their eyes and brains. So how do they do it? 
And what other secrets are they keeping? This extraordinary salamander is native
to the wetlands in Mexico City. Ancient Aztec people considered it 
the incarnation of a God named Xolotl— hence the axolotl’s name, 
roughly meaning “water monster.” Axolotls reach sexual maturity with gills

created a vast system of canals, expanding the lake system’s 
shallow, sheltered habitat— the axolotls’ ideal environment. But when Spanish invaders arrived,
they began draining the lakes. And even more water has been
diverted in recent years. Today, the entire population of wild
axolotls is found in just one place, Lake Xochimilco, where it’s threatened
by pollution and invasive fishes. People are working to regenerate
the ecosystem and strengthen the 2,000 year old 
chinampa farming tradition. If interest grows, farmers could recover
abandoned chinampas and support the local community—
along with the axolotl. Eventually, the benefits of saving 
this salamander might be even greater. Scientists hope that one day
we’ll be able to apply the axolotl’s masterful tumor suppression
and regenerative abilities to the human body. Perhaps its secrets are the real reason 
for the slimy god monster’s smile.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Scientists hope that one day they will be able to duplicate the axolotls’ _________ and ______ in the human body.

**Transcript**:
In August 1947, India gained independence
after 200 years of British rule. What followed was one of the largest and
bloodiest forced migrations in history. An estimated one million people 
lost their lives. Before British colonization, the Indian subcontinent was a patchwork 
of regional kingdoms known as princely states populated 
by Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, and Jews. Each princely state had 
its own traditions, caste backgrounds, and leadership. Starting in the 1500s, a series 
of European powers colonized India with coastal trading settlements. By the mid-18th century, 
the English East India Company emerged as the primary colonial power 
in India. The British ruled some provinces directly,
and ruled the princely states indirectly. Under indirect rule, the princely states
remained sovereign but made political and financial 
concessions to the British. In the 19th century, the British began to 
categorize Indians by religious identity— a gross simplification 
of the communities in India. They counted Hindus as “majorities” and all other religious communities 
as distinct “minorities,” with Muslims being the largest minority. Sikhs were considered part of the Hindu
community by everyone but themselves. In elections, people could only vote 
for candidates of their own religious identification. These practices exaggerated differences, sowing distrust between communities
that had previously co-existed. The 20th century began with decades 
of anti-colonial movements, where Indians fought for independence
from Britain. In the aftermath of World War II, under enormous financial strain 
from the war, Britain finally caved. Indian political leaders had 
differing views on what an independent India 
should look like. Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru
represented the Hindu majority and wanted one united India. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, 
who led the Muslim minority, thought the rifts created by colonization
were too deep to repair. Jinnah argued for a two nation division where Muslims would have a homeland 
called Pakistan. Following riots in 1946 and 1947,
the British expedited their retreat, planning Indian independence
behind closed doors. In June 1947, the British viceroy
announced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned
into Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how
exactly this would happen. Using outdated maps, inaccurate census
numbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks,
the Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces 
under direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam. The border took into account where 
Hindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location
and population percentages. So if a Hindu majority area bordered
another Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered
Muslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan. Princely states on the border had to
choose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process. While the Boundary Committee worked 
on the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part 
of the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure. Families divided themselves. Fearing sexual violence, parents sent 
young daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe. The new map wasn’t revealed 
until August 17th, 1947— two days after independence. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated 
East and West Pakistan. The rest became Hindu-majority India. In a period of two years, millions 
of Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India 
fled villages where their families had lived
for centuries. The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, 
Dhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents 
and filled with refugees. In the power vacuum British forces
left behind, radicalized militias and local groups 
massacred migrants. Much of the violence occurred in Punjab,
and women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation. Around 100,000 women were kidnapped 
and forced to marry their captors. The problems created by Partition went far
beyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves 
became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became
the new country of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir
decided to join India— a decision that was to be finalized
by a public referendum of the majority Muslim population. That referendum still hasn't
happened as of 2020, and India and Pakistan have been warring
over Kashmir since 1947. More than 70 years later, the legacies of the Partition remain 
clear in the subcontinent: in its new political formations and 
in the memories of divided families.

beyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves 
became permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became
the new country of Bangladesh. Meanwhile, the Hindu ruler of Kashmir
decided to join India— a decision that was to be finalized
by a public referendum of the majority Muslim population. That referendum still hasn't
happened as of 2020, and India and Pakistan have been warring
over Kashmir since 1947. More than 70 years later, the legacies of the Partition remain 
clear in the subcontinent: in its new political formations and 
in the memories of divided families.

**Transcript**:
On sunny days, 
the Roman citizens of Ostia could be found on a long stone bench
near the Forum. Friends and neighbors exchanged 
news and gossip while simultaneously attending
to more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit
up to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the
restroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone,
our shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions 
in the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts 
contain instructions for keeping waste away
from drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar
shape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had
clay structures made for squatting or sitting 
in the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used
running water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished 
in the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected
to a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered
a manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain 
what inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management
is essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground
for dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera,
dysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before
scientists fully understood the relationship between
sewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have
recorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex 
sanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously 
flowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste 
outside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period 
also had private and public toilets, except their waste 
was immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors
gathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste 
management continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation 
into the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs” 
became commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently
dumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows
into communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers 
would load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits 
to dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach
persisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent
some major changes. By the late Middle Ages, 
most wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled
by the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring 
the king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship 
with the monarch made him a surprisingly
influential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology
came in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed 
the first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water 
and a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention 
stank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775, 
Scottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe 
to retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved
into the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates 
the inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed 
modern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range
of features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t 
have their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion 
don’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities 
at risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need 
to invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial, 
and political issues that produce inequity 
throughout the sanitation pipeline.

**Transcript**:
On sunny days, 
the Roman citizens of Ostia could be found on a long stone bench
near the Forum. Friends and neighbors exchanged 
news and gossip while simultaneously attending
to more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit
up to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the
restroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone,
our shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions 
in the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts 
contain instructions for keeping waste away
from drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar
shape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had
clay structures made for squatting or sitting 
in the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used
running water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished 
in the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected
to a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered
a manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain 
what inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management
is essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground
for dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera,
dysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before
scientists fully understood the relationship between
sewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have
recorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex 
sanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously 
flowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste 
outside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period 
also had private and public toilets, except their waste 
was immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors
gathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste 
management continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation 
into the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs” 
became commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently
dumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows
into communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers 
would load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits 
to dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach
persisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent
some major changes. By the late Middle Ages, 
most wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled
by the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring 
the king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship 
with the monarch made him a surprisingly
influential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology
came in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed 
the first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water 
and a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention 
stank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775, 
Scottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe 
to retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved
into the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates 
the inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed 
modern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range
of features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t 
have their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion 
don’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities 
at risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need 
to invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial, 
and political issues that produce inequity 
throughout the sanitation pipeline.

**Transcript**:
In the coastal waters of the Bahamas, a young lemon shark is on the run
from a surprising predator: an adult shark of her own species. Half of her 17 siblings have already
been eaten by the older generation, and it looks as though 
she’s about to join them. But just as the predator closes in, she disappears into a thicket
of underwater roots, safe in the refuge of the mangrove forest. Forests don’t usually come to mind
as a habitat for sharks. But various marine forests cover roughly 
4.2 million square kilometers of the planet, providing food and shelter
for 35% of the world’s sharks. Deadly tiger sharks
blend into seagrass meadows before pouncing on sea cows 
and sea turtles. White sharks hunt down seals in forests
of kelp towering 65 meters tall. And lemon sharks stalk
forests of mangroves— the only trees on Earth 
that live in the ocean. All these ecosystems have their quirks, but mangroves may be the most unique 
of all. Harboring life between their roots
and among their crowns, mangroves function as an essential bridge
between land and sea. And to survive between these worlds,
different mangrove species have evolved various adaptations that 
protect them and their resident sharks. Taking root in the unstable ground 
of muddy coastal regions is difficult, so mangrove seedlings germinate 
attached to their mother plant. Once they've grown large enough
to survive on their own, these partially developed plants begin 
to ride the current. Most take root nearby, 
while some travel for several months before landing in a different part 
of the world. Once they’ve settled down,
mangroves deploy tall, skinny stilt roots, crutch-like prop roots 
or wavy buttress roots, to support themselves 
in their unsteady terrain. These newly established mangroves have 
to contend with two additional problems: seawater is high in dehydrating
and potentially toxic salt, and the mud contains little to no oxygen. This combination would be
lethal to most trees, but mangroves make the most 
of their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots 
are largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these
roots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create 
a waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen 
through the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use 
incredibly fine filters in their roots. Others concentrate salt 
inside special cellular compartments, bark or dying leaves, that then drop off. Some species can even excrete 
the excess minerals through specially adapted salt glands. All these processes make mangroves
more than a little salty, but that doesn’t deter coastal life 
from living in their nooks and crannies. While birds nest among mangrove branches, fish lay eggs amidst 
their sprawling, complex root systems. Symbiotic sponges and sea squirts 
protect their host trees from hungry woodboring crustaceans. Crabs, snails, and shrimp 
eat algae, mussels, barnacles, and salty mangrove detritus. These animals in turn feed fish, which are devoured by shark pups 
roaming the roots— alongside occasional
vegetarian meals of seagrass. But sharks aren’t just the beneficiaries
of marine forests, they’re part of the glue 
that holds them together. Sharks limit the abundance of animals which would otherwise overgraze 
these essential plants. Just as marine forests provide shelter 
to vulnerable baby predators, those predators grow up
to protect their forest homes. Unfortunately, both sides of this delicate
balance are under threat. Overfishing has decimated 
shark populations worldwide, and many marine forests are being polluted
or cut down for coastal development. This destruction
is especially dangerous because marine forests are one 
of the single most important ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Mangroves and seagrasses trap
carbon between their roots, and fast-growing kelps export vast
amounts of carbon to the deep ocean. Together, marine forests sequester around
310 million tonnes of carbon every year, capturing 3% of our annual
global carbon emissions. So, like the sharks that inhabit them, humans need to fight tooth and nail 
to protect these essential ecosystems.

of their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots 
are largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these
roots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create 
a waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen 
through the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use 
incredibly fine filters in their roots. Others concentrate salt 
inside special cellular compartments, bark or dying leaves, that then drop off. Some species can even excrete 
the excess minerals through specially adapted salt glands. All these processes make mangroves
more than a little salty, but that doesn’t deter coastal life 
from living in their nooks and crannies. While birds nest among mangrove branches, fish lay eggs amidst 
their sprawling, complex root systems. Symbiotic sponges and sea squirts 
protect their host trees from hungry woodboring crustaceans. Crabs, snails, and shrimp 
eat algae, mussels, barnacles, and salty mangrove detritus. These animals in turn feed fish, which are devoured by shark pups 
roaming the roots— alongside occasional
vegetarian meals of seagrass. But sharks aren’t just the beneficiaries
of marine forests, they’re part of the glue 
that holds them together. Sharks limit the abundance of animals which would otherwise overgraze 
these essential plants. Just as marine forests provide shelter 
to vulnerable baby predators, those predators grow up
to protect their forest homes. Unfortunately, both sides of this delicate
balance are under threat. Overfishing has decimated 
shark populations worldwide, and many marine forests are being polluted
or cut down for coastal development. This destruction
is especially dangerous because marine forests are one 
of the single most important ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Mangroves and seagrasses trap
carbon between their roots, and fast-growing kelps export vast
amounts of carbon to the deep ocean. Together, marine forests sequester around
310 million tonnes of carbon every year, capturing 3% of our annual
global carbon emissions. So, like the sharks that inhabit them, humans need to fight tooth and nail 
to protect these essential ecosystems.

**Transcript**:
In the coastal waters of the Bahamas, a young lemon shark is on the run
from a surprising predator: an adult shark of her own species. Half of her 17 siblings have already
been eaten by the older generation, and it looks as though 
she’s about to join them. But just as the predator closes in, she disappears into a thicket
of underwater roots, safe in the refuge of the mangrove forest. Forests don’t usually come to mind
as a habitat for sharks. But various marine forests cover roughly 
4.2 million square kilometers of the planet, providing food and shelter
for 35% of the world’s sharks. Deadly tiger sharks
blend into seagrass meadows before pouncing on sea cows 
and sea turtles. White sharks hunt down seals in forests
of kelp towering 65 meters tall. And lemon sharks stalk
forests of mangroves— the only trees on Earth 
that live in the ocean. All these ecosystems have their quirks, but mangroves may be the most unique 
of all. Harboring life between their roots
and among their crowns, mangroves function as an essential bridge
between land and sea. And to survive between these worlds,
different mangrove species have evolved various adaptations that 
protect them and their resident sharks. Taking root in the unstable ground 
of muddy coastal regions is difficult, so mangrove seedlings germinate 
attached to their mother plant. Once they've grown large enough
to survive on their own, these partially developed plants begin 
to ride the current. Most take root nearby, 
while some travel for several months before landing in a different part 
of the world. Once they’ve settled down,
mangroves deploy tall, skinny stilt roots, crutch-like prop roots 
or wavy buttress roots, to support themselves 
in their unsteady terrain. These newly established mangroves have 
to contend with two additional problems: seawater is high in dehydrating
and potentially toxic salt, and the mud contains little to no oxygen. This combination would be
lethal to most trees, but mangroves make the most 
of their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots 
are largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these
roots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create 
a waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen 
through the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use

i'm brad meltzer and i write about heroes for a living but this is without question the most important book that i've ever worked on is the story of anne frank hi i'm anne frank and you're gonna see that this story is about hope the most important things we need in the world today i wrote these books as always to give my kids better heroes to look up to i can't think of anyone or anything to give them better than some hope and we all need it right now i will also see today that i am not reading alone i am reading uh with a friend named saul dreyer hello everybody my name is sal dreyer i'm 95 years old and i'm a holocaust survivor this again is i am anne frank by my favorite author brad meltzer illustrated by the amazing chris hellopolis and this is the story that speaks for itself i am anne frank when i was born my sister loved laughing at my big ears look they're huge i also have big eyes and the cutest smile oh she's adorable look at her ears a sister says as a girl i love the same things many kids love playing hide and seek and tag ice skating and going to the movies i collected autographs and knew the names of every celebrity that's rin tin tin one of the other things i really loved was writing stories this was my teacher hendrika kuperas she was so encouraging wonderful job and one other thing that's important to know about me is that i'm jewish that's my religion i believe in god and in helping to make the world a better place but when i was born in germany there were people knewing as nazi who didn't like those of us who were jewish or other groups who were different from them back then the nazis were run by a terrible leader named adolf hitler who promised to make germany strong again don't buy from jews they say germans unite why are they being so mean they don't even know us he believed that germans were superior and he blamed the jews for all of germany's problems even though we hadn't done anything wrong they protect us from the nazi my family became refugees and moved to a city called amsterdam in the netherlands life was good there for years until may the 10th 1940 when the german came to the netherlands too the nazi that tried to take over the world we need to leave here now it's not safe anymore we tried to leave the netherlands and go to the united states but we couldn't you need to fill out more forms if you want to be an immigrant but my family if we stay here i'm sorry more forms please when the germans arrived in the netherlands they passed new laws here at first jews weren't allowed in public parks beaches pools or in libraries we can't go swimming jews are not wanted here then they said we couldn't go to the movies but i love the movies we don't serve juice here eventually we weren't allowed to ride our own bikes drive our own cars or buy food or certain restaurants i just want to feed my family no jews allowed one of the worst days was when they said we have to leave our school and only be with all the jewish kids i'm sorry teacher says those are the new rules no jews allowed i'll miss you and i'll miss all of you every day it seemed to get worse in april 1942 the nazis made us wear these jewish stars with the dutch word for jew why do we have to wear these whenever we go out so they can always identify us if we got caught outside without our star we'd get in trouble i know it sounds scary but this isn't a story about fear it's a story about hope even when bad things happen there are good things all around on friday june 12th i woke up really early it was my birthday every year my parents put all my presents out on the table and this year i couldn't wait for one particular gift a diary it had its own little lock i love it i started writing immediately dear kitty kitty was the name i gave to my diary i wanted the diary to be my friend a few weeks later we got terrible news what is it dear margo our daughter they sent her a call up notice we knew what a call up really meant the nazis would send people to a concentration camp a prison where jews were locked up and made to work all day and night there was almost nothing to eat or drink if you went there escape was nearly impossible my parents were running out of options if we stayed the nazis would come for my sister if we tried to leave they'd hunt us down there's only one choice we need to hide my parents told us to stop packing we couldn't only take our most important things the first thing i grabbed was this diary a book yes a place to hold my daily thoughts we wore layers of clothes so no one would see us carrying suitcases the hardest part was saying goodbye to my cat the neighbors will take good care of her i promise my father said i love you mosh day as we snuck out there were four of us and another family of three met us there this was our hiding spot a small area at the back of my father's office the secret annex the bookcase covered the entryway and could swing shut so no one would find us and here's what she wrote our hiding place has now become a true hiding place our new home was about the size of one bedroom apartment for seven of us this was my parents living room and bedroom how are we all going to fit see the attic up top the bookcase entrance and this was for me and my sister abscess was another room it was a bedroom kitchen and living room all in one for the van pelt the other jewish family hiding with us plus there was a place for the issue since there were still people working in dad's old office we'd spend our days up here on the higher floor so no one would hear us it wasn't an easy place to live there's no hot water i know make the best of it but what do you mean we can't flush the toilet during the day if you do people will hear the noise and we'll be arrested and for dinner beans again shhh the workers downstairs will hear us beans again and beans tomorrow during weekdays we had to whisper we could never talk in abnormal voice all the windows were covered and since shoes were noisy on the wood plus we usually were sucks to be extra quiet one wrong move and the nazis might find us it would have been easy to complain but i decided to look at the bright side and she wrote it may be damp and lopsided but there's probably not a more comfortable hiding place in all of amsterdam no in all of holland to make it feel more normal i decorated my walls with pictures of movie stars my dad surprised me by bringing along my collection of magazines to make everyone laugh peanut i would dress up he wore his mom's dress and i wore his suit there was one big bright spot though the non-jewish helpers who risked their own lives to protect us this is meep guys she'd bring us groceries and tell us what was happening in the world here's more food and i got you a little present this is johannes kleinman who brought me my favorite books including fairy tales and ones about real historical heroes and that's johan vasquez who built the bookcase that hit us and you'll see john geese b foska jewel and victor coogler the nazis threatened to punish anyone who helped the jewish people but these amazing people decided it was more important to do the right thing and help us they weren't the only ones this is my dentist fritz pfeiffer i know there are seven of you but he needs a place to hide too he can stay we'll make room our hiding spot was time but when someone needs help you can turn away we hid in the secret annex for two years and one month i went to school here i wanted to be a famous writer to make an impact on people's lives we took our school books with us and the helpers would bring more we studied every day until 12 30. after that we peeled potatoes on weekends we could listen to the radio with eight of us clean together our world was very small but if you look for what's good you'll find it this was the attic my favorite spot it had the one window that wasn't covered where i could see the blue sky and this one chestnut tree i grew up here i saw the world from here and eventually the world saw me and here's what she wrote who knows maybe our religion will teach the world and all the people in it about goodness as long as this exists this sunshine and this cloudless sky and as long as i can enjoy it how sad can i be as long as you can look fearlessly at the sky you'll know that you're pure within and will find happiness once more and of course she wrote i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart in my life there were many reasons to be sad and lonely and scared but there were also many reasons to love and laugh and hope you can always find light in the darkest places that's what hope is it's a fire within you you decide when to light it and when it burns bright nothing can put it out hitler and the nazis were defeated at the end of world war ii six million jews including anne frank were killed in what is now known as the holocaust by remembering and telling anne's story we make sure that nothing like this ever happens again whatever our religion wherever we're from we have a responsibility to one another today anne frank's diary is one of the most read most inspiring books in the world more than one million people visit the anne frank house in amsterdam each year in 2010 anne's chestnut tree was blown down in a storm but today and here's what i love there were locations all over the world where its saplings were planted and new chestnut trees bloom stronger than ever and the jewish faith is the same if a person saves one life it's as if they've saved an entire world throughout your life you'll find people who need help be a helper be the one who does the right thing when you see something that's unfair do not be silent sometimes it will be hard when it is look up see the beauty of the world and see the beauty in people now you knew my story and i am a part of u.s never target the world depends on it i am frank and i believe that people are truly good at heart think of all the beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy now i never do this but i think it's important this book is dedicated and i'll read it to you from the back in memory of anne frank and the six million jewish victims of the holocaust and in honor of all the righteous helpers who risked their lives by coming to the aid of those who needed it what we love most is always on the back i believe that people are truly good at heart thank you for joining us here today thank you on behalf of myself and saul dreyer we love you so and we remember this is iron man frank and everyone keep reading keep reading keep reading you can always find hope you just have to look for it

and for dinner beans again shhh the workers downstairs will hear us beans again and beans tomorrow during weekdays we had to whisper we could never talk in abnormal voice all the windows were covered and since shoes were noisy on the wood plus we usually were sucks to be extra quiet one wrong move and the nazis might find us it would have been easy to complain but i decided to look at the bright side and she wrote it may be damp and lopsided but there's probably not a more comfortable hiding place in all of amsterdam no in all of holland to make it feel more normal i decorated my walls with pictures of movie stars my dad surprised me by bringing along my collection of magazines to make everyone laugh peanut i would dress up he wore his mom's dress and i wore his suit there was one big bright spot though the non-jewish helpers who risked their own lives to protect us this is meep guys she'd bring us groceries and tell us what was happening in the world here's more food and i got you a little present this is johannes kleinman who brought me my favorite books including fairy tales and ones about real historical heroes and that's johan vasquez who built the bookcase that hit us and you'll see john geese b foska jewel and victor coogler the nazis threatened to punish anyone who helped the jewish people but these amazing people decided it was more important to do the right thing and help us they weren't the only ones this is my dentist fritz pfeiffer i know there are seven of you but he needs a place to hide too he can stay we'll make room our hiding spot was time but when someone needs help you can turn away we hid in the secret annex for two years and one month i went to school here i wanted to be a famous writer to make an impact on people's lives we took our school books with us and the helpers would bring more we studied every day until 12 30. after that we peeled potatoes on weekends we could listen to the radio with eight of us clean together our world was very small but if you look for what's good you'll find it this was the attic my favorite spot it had the one window that wasn't covered where i could see the blue sky and this one chestnut tree i grew up here i saw the world from here and eventually the world saw me and here's what she wrote who knows maybe our religion will teach the world and all the people in it about goodness as long as this exists this sunshine and this cloudless sky and as long as i can enjoy it how sad can i be as long as you can look fearlessly at the sky you'll know that you're pure within and will find happiness once more and of course she wrote i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart in my life there were many reasons to be sad and lonely and scared but there were also many reasons to love and laugh and hope you can always find light in the darkest places that's what hope is it's a fire within you you decide when to light it and when it burns bright nothing can put it out hitler and the nazis were defeated at the end of world war ii six million jews including anne frank were killed in what is now known as the holocaust by remembering and telling anne's story we

years old and i'm a holocaust survivor this again is i am anne frank by my favorite author brad meltzer illustrated by the amazing chris hellopolis and this is the story that speaks for itself i am anne frank when i was born my sister loved laughing at my big ears look they're huge i also have big eyes and the cutest smile oh she's adorable look at her ears a sister says as a girl i love the same things many kids love playing hide and seek and tag ice skating and going to the movies i collected autographs and knew the names of every celebrity that's rin tin tin one of the other things i really loved was writing stories this was my teacher hendrika kuperas she was so encouraging wonderful job and one other thing that's important to know about me is that i'm jewish that's my religion i believe in god and in helping to make the world a better place but when i was born in germany there were people knewing as nazi who didn't like those of us who were jewish or other groups who were different from them back then the nazis were run by a terrible leader named adolf hitler who promised to make germany strong again don't buy from jews they say germans unite why are they being so mean they don't even know us he believed that germans were superior and he blamed the jews for all of germany's problems even though we hadn't done anything wrong they protect us from the nazi my family became refugees and moved to a city called amsterdam in the netherlands life was good there for years until may the 10th 1940 when the german came to the netherlands too the nazi that tried to take over the world we need to leave here now it's not safe anymore we tried to leave the netherlands and go to the united states but we couldn't you need to fill out more forms if you want to be an

in libraries we can't go swimming jews are not wanted here then they said we couldn't go to the movies but i love the movies we don't serve juice here eventually we weren't allowed to ride our own bikes drive our own cars or buy food or certain restaurants i just want to feed my family no jews allowed one of the worst days was when they said we have to leave our school and only be with all the jewish kids i'm sorry teacher says those are the new rules no jews allowed i'll miss you and i'll miss all of you every day it seemed to get worse in april 1942 the nazis made us wear these jewish stars with the dutch word for jew why do we have to wear these whenever we go out so they can always identify us if we got caught outside without our star we'd get in trouble i know it sounds scary

impossible my parents were running out of options if we stayed the nazis would come for my sister if we tried to leave they'd hunt us down there's only one choice we need to hide my parents told us to stop packing we couldn't only take our most important things the first thing i grabbed was this diary a book yes a place to hold my daily thoughts we wore layers of clothes so no one would see us

**Transcript**:
As the sun rises over Delphi in 500 BCE, Aristonike hurries
to the temple of Apollo. Like all Greeks, she's known the legend
of Delphi since childhood. Two eagles released by Zeus 
from opposite ends of the Earth met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, identifying Delphi 
as the center of the world. Marking this spot was a mysterious stone
guarded by a legendary serpent called the pytho. But when Apollo killed the pytho,
he made Delphi his home— establishing the city
as the best place in the world to seek guidance directly
from the God of Prophecy. Well, almost directly. At any given time, a single oracle known 
as the Pythia communicates Apollo’s will. Reserved only for women, this is 
the most important job in the city— and one that Aristonike will soon have to 
take on as the current Pythia-in-training. Despite serving in the Temple of Apollo 
for many years, Aristonike is still uncertain that she’s
wise enough to fulfill this role. But these doubts will have to wait. Today she’ll be shadowed by officials 
from the city’s governing council. If her performance meets their standards, this is the day she’ll become 
the new Oracle of Delphi. In the heart of the temenos, 
or sacred enclosure, Aristonike greets the current Oracle
and the city officials. The group joins the procession
to the Castilian Spring, where the Pythia performs 
a purification ceremony to prepare for a day of prophecy. To establish whether
Apollo is willing to be consulted, Aristonike brings water from the spring 
to the temple priests, who sprinkle it on a goat. If the goat shudders, 
it will be a prophecy day. If not, travelers from as far away as 
modern day Sicily, Egypt, and Afghanistan will have to wait an entire month 
to consult the Oracle again. Fortunately, Apollo
is in a communicative mood. Delphians are first in line, most seeking
advice about business or marriage. Following the locals are other Greeks 
and then non-Greeks, including ambassadors from great
cities who plan to ask about whether to go to war, 
or where they should found new colonies. Most supplicants bring two options
for the Pythia to choose between, alongside the obligatory sacrificial cake. Aristonike reports back to the Pythia, pointing out important figures 
and sharing some of their concerns— all while the city counselor takes
notes on her performance. Then the Pythia disappears into her 
oracular chamber known as the adyton. Inside, she’ll channel the inspiration 
of Apollo, uttering ambiguous prophecies
the questioners must interpret. The adyton is the one place in the temple 
Aristonike isn’t allowed to go. So while consultations continue, the Oracle-in-training sets off to collect
wood for the temple’s eternal flame. While gathering branches 
from the sacred laurel trees, Aristonike spies wealthy Greeks 
training for the upcoming Pythian Games. Second in importance only to the Olympics, these games bring great riches
and attention to Delphi. Typically, Aristonike would pause
to admire the athletes, but today she’s more focused
on impressing her observer. Taking the exact amount
of branches necessary, she hurries back to the temple 
for her long awaited evaluation. The counselor who shadowed her 
shares his notes with the other officials, and after a brief discussion,
their leader nods. He endorses Aristonike as the new Oracle— and the Pythia offers Apollo’s blessing 
on their verdict. Approaching Aristonike 
beside the sacred hearth, the Pythia finally unveils 
the secrets of her trade. Passed directly from one Oracle 
to the next, no history book will ever
record these details. But the Pythia’s insights will guide 
all of Aristonike’s future prophecies— shaping wars, politics, and relationships
for years to come, and making Aristonike one of the most
powerful women in the ancient world. As the Pythia concludes her final lesson, she points to two inscriptions 
on the temple walls: “know yourself” and “nothing in excess.” Left alone to ponder these ideas, Aristonike feels the first touch 
of Apollo’s inspiration— the insight that keeping an open mind
may be more important than finding a single answer.

**Transcript**:
As the sun rises over Delphi in 500 BCE, Aristonike hurries
to the temple of Apollo. Like all Greeks, she's known the legend
of Delphi since childhood. Two eagles released by Zeus 
from opposite ends of the Earth met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, identifying Delphi 
as the center of the world. Marking this spot was a mysterious stone
guarded by a legendary serpent called the pytho. But when Apollo killed the pytho,
he made Delphi his home— establishing the city
as the best place in the world to seek guidance directly
from the God of Prophecy. Well, almost directly. At any given time, a single oracle known 
as the Pythia communicates Apollo’s will. Reserved only for women, this is 
the most important job in the city— and one that Aristonike will soon have to 
take on as the current Pythia-in-training. Despite serving in the Temple of Apollo 
for many years, Aristonike is still uncertain that she’s
wise enough to fulfill this role. But these doubts will have to wait. Today she’ll be shadowed by officials 
from the city’s governing council. If her performance meets their standards, this is the day she’ll become 
the new Oracle of Delphi. In the heart of the temenos, 
or sacred enclosure, Aristonike greets the current Oracle
and the city officials. The group joins the procession
to the Castilian Spring, where the Pythia performs 
a purification ceremony to prepare for a day of prophecy. To establish whether
Apollo is willing to be consulted, Aristonike brings water from the spring 
to the temple priests, who sprinkle it on a goat. If the goat shudders, 
it will be a prophecy day. If not, travelers from as far away as 
modern day Sicily, Egypt, and Afghanistan will have to wait an entire month 
to consult the Oracle again. Fortunately, Apollo
is in a communicative mood. Delphians are first in line, most seeking
advice about business or marriage. Following the locals are other Greeks 
and then non-Greeks, including ambassadors from great
cities who plan to ask about whether to go to war, 
or where they should found new colonies. Most supplicants bring two options
for the Pythia to choose between, alongside the obligatory sacrificial cake. Aristonike reports back to the Pythia, pointing out important figures 
and sharing some of their concerns— all while the city counselor takes
notes on her performance. Then the Pythia disappears into her 
oracular chamber known as the adyton. Inside, she’ll channel the inspiration 
of Apollo, uttering ambiguous prophecies
the questioners must interpret. The adyton is the one place in the temple 
Aristonike isn’t allowed to go. So while consultations continue, the Oracle-in-training sets off to collect
wood for the temple’s eternal flame. While gathering branches 
from the sacred laurel trees, Aristonike spies wealthy Greeks 
training for the upcoming Pythian Games. Second in importance only to the Olympics, these games bring great riches
and attention to Delphi. Typically, Aristonike would pause
to admire the athletes, but today she’s more focused
on impressing her observer. Taking the exact amount
of branches necessary, she hurries back to the temple 
for her long awaited evaluation. The counselor who shadowed her 
shares his notes with the other officials, and after a brief discussion,
their leader nods. He endorses Aristonike as the new Oracle— and the Pythia offers Apollo’s blessing 
on their verdict. Approaching Aristonike 
beside the sacred hearth, the Pythia finally unveils 
the secrets of her trade. Passed directly from one Oracle 
to the next, no history book will ever
record these details. But the Pythia’s insights will guide 
all of Aristonike’s future prophecies— shaping wars, politics, and relationships
for years to come, and making Aristonike one of the most
powerful women in the ancient world. As the Pythia concludes her final lesson, she points to two inscriptions 
on the temple walls: “know yourself” and “nothing in excess.” Left alone to ponder these ideas, Aristonike feels the first touch 
of Apollo’s inspiration— the insight that keeping an open mind
may be more important than finding a single answer.

**Transcript**:
I grew up in the late '70s in rural China during the final years of my country's
pursuit of absolute equality at the expense of liberty. At that time, everybody had a job, but everyone was struggling. In the early '80s,
my dad was an electrician, and my mom worked two shifts
in the local hospital. But still, we didn't have enough food, and our living conditions were dismal. We were undoubtedly equal -- we were equally poor. The state owned everything. We owned nothing. The story I'm going to share with you
is about my struggles of overcoming adversity with my resilience, grit
and sheer determination. No, I'm just kidding,
I'm not going to do that to you. (Laughter) Instead, I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to talk about today
is about a new form of collective poverty that many of us don't recognize and that urgently needs to be understood. I'm sure you've noticed
that in the past 20 years, that asset has emerged. It's been generating wealth
at a breakneck pace. As a tool, it has brought businesses
deep customer insights, operational efficiency and enormous top-line growth. But for some, it has also provided a device
to manipulate a democratic election or perform surveillance
for profit or political purposes. What is this miracle asset? You've guessed it: it's data. Seven out of the top 10 most valuable
companies in the world are tech companies that either directly generate
profit from data or are empowered by data from the core. Multiple surveys show that the vast majority
of business decision makers regard data as an essential
asset for success. We have all experienced how data
is shifting this major paradigm shift for our personal, economic
and political lives. Whoever owns the data owns the future. But who's producing the data? I assume everyone in this room
has a smartphone, several social media accounts and has done a Google search
or two in the past week. We are all producing data. Yes. It is estimated that by 2030,
10 years from now, there will be about 125 billion
connected devices in the world. That's an average of about
15 devices per person. We are already producing data every day. We'll be producing exponentially more. Google, Facebook and Tencent's
combined revenue in 2018 was 236 billion US dollars. Now, how many of you
have received payment from them for the data you generate for them? None, right? Data has immense value
but is centrally controlled and owned. You are all walking raw materials
for those large data companies, but none of you are paid. Not only that, you're not even considered
as part of this equation for income. So once again, we are undoubtedly equal: we're equally poor. Somebody else owns everything,
and we own nothing. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? So what should we do? There might be some clues
in how my life turned out after that difficult start. Things began to look up
for my family in the '80s. The system evolved, and people began to be allowed
to own a piece of what we created. "People diving into the ocean," or "xia hai," the Chinese term, described those who left
state-owned enterprise jobs and started their own businesses. Private ownership of a business became personal ownership of cars, properties, food, clothes and things. The economic machine started rolling, and people's lives began to improve. For the first time, to get rich was glorious. So in the '90s, when I went
to study in Chengdu in west China, many young individuals like myself were well-positioned
to take advantage of the new system. After I graduated from my university, I cofounded my first business
and moved to Shenzhen, the brand-new special economic zone
that used to be a fishing village. Twenty years later, Shenzhen has become
a global innovation powerhouse. Private ownership was a form of liberty
we didn't have before. It created unprecedented opportunities
for our generations, motivating us to work
and study incredibly hard. The result was that more than
850 million people rose out of poverty. According to the World Bank, China's extreme poverty rate in 1981,
when I was a little kid, was 88 percent. By 2015, 0.7 percent. I am a product of that success, and I am very happy to share that today,
I have my own AI business, and I lead a very worldly
and dynamic life, a path that was unimaginable
when I was a kid in west China. Of course, this prosperity
came with a trade-off, with equality,
the environment and freedom. And obviously I'm not here to argue
that China has it all figured out. We haven't. Nor that data is fully comparable
to physical assets. It is not. But my life experience allowed me
to see what's hiding in plain sight. Currently, the public discourse is so focused on the regulatory
and privacy issue when it comes to data ownership. But I want to ask: What if we look at data ownership
in completely different ways? What if data ownership is, in fact, a personal, individual and economic issue? What if, in the new digital economy, we are allowed to own
a piece of what we create and give people the liberty
of private data ownership? The legal concept of ownership
is when you can possess, use, gift, pass on, destroy or trade it or sell your asset at a price accepted by you. What if we give that same definition
to individuals' data, so individuals can use or destroy our data or we trade it at our chosen price? Now, I know some of you might say, "I would never, ever trade my data
for any amount of money." But that, let me remind you,
is exactly what you're doing now, except you're giving
your data away for free. Plus, privacy is a very personal
and nuanced issue. You might have the privilege
to prioritize your privacy over money, but for millions of small
business owners in China who can't get bank loans easily, using their data to gain rapid loan
approval from AI-powered lenders can answer their more pressing needs. What's private to you is different from
what's private to others. What's private to you now is different from what was private
when you were in college. Or, at least, I hope so. (Laughter) We are always,
although often subconsciously, making such trade-offs based on our diverse personal beliefs
and life priorities. That is why data ownership
would be incomplete without a pricing power. By assigning pricing power to individuals, we gain a tool to reflect
our personal and nuanced preferences. So, for example, you could choose
to donate your data for free if a contribution
to a particular medical research is very meaningful for you. Or, if we had the tools
to set our behavior data at a price of, say,
100,000 US dollars, I doubt any political group
would be able to target or manipulate your vote. You control. You decide. Now, I know this sounds
probably implausible, but trends are already pointing to a growing and very powerful
individual data ownership movement. First, start-ups
are already creating tools to allow us to take back some control. A new browser called Brave empowers users with "Brave Shields" --
they literally call it that -- by aggressively blocking
data-grabbing ads and trackers, and avoid leaking data
like other browsers. In return, users can take back
some bargaining and pricing power. When users opt in to accept ads, Brave rewards users
with "basic attention tokens" that can redeem content
behind paywalls from publishers. And I've been using Brave
for a few months. It has already blocked
more than 200,000 ads and trackers and saved hours of my time. Now, I know some of you
interact with your browser more than with your partners, so -- (Laughter) you should at least find one that doesn't
waste your time and is not creepy. (Laughter) Do you think Google is indispensable? Think again. A search engine is indispensable. Google just has the monopoly -- for now. A search engine called DuckDuckGo
doesn't store your personal information or follow you around with ads or track your personal browsing history. Instead, it gives all users
the same search results instead of based on
your personal browsing records. In London, a company called digi.me offers an app you can download
on your smartphone that helps to import and consolidate
your data generated by you from your Fitbit, Spotify, social media accounts ... And you can choose
where to store your data, and digi.me will help you
to make your data work for you by providing insights that used
to be exclusively accessible by large data companies. In DC, a new initiative
called UBDI, U-B-D-I, Universal Basic Data Income, helps people to make money by sharing anonymous insights
through their data for companies that can use them
for market research. And whenever a company purchases a study, users get paid in cash and UBDI points
to track their contribution, potentially as much
as 1,000 US dollars per year per their estimation. UBDI could be a very feasible path
for universal basic income in the AI economy. Further, individual awareness
of privacy and data ownership is growing fast as we all become aware of this monster
we have unleashed in our pocket. I'm a mother of two preteen girls, and trust me, the single biggest source of stress
and anxiety as a parent, for me, is my children's
relationship with technology. This is a three-page agreement
my husband and I make them sign before they receive
their first [mobile phone]. (Laughter) We want to help them to become digital citizens, but only if we can make them
become smart and responsible ones. I help them to understand
what kind of data should never be shared. So if you Google me, in fact -- actually, sorry --
if you DuckDuckGo me, you will find maybe a lot
about me and my work, but you may find no information
about my daughters. When they grow up, if they want to put themselves out there,
it's their choice, not mine, despite that I insist
they're the most beautiful, smartest and most extraordinary
kids in the world, of course. And I know many people
are having similar conversations and making similar decisions, which gives me hope that a truly smart data-rich future
will be here soon. But I want to highlight
the Clause 6 of this agreement. It says, "I will never, ever search
for any information online if I would be embarrassed
if seen by Grandma Dawnie." (Laughter) Try it. It's really effective. (Laughter) Throughout history, there has always been a trade-off
between liberty and equality in the pursuit of prosperity. The world has constantly been going
through the circle of wealth accumulation to wealth redistribution. As the tension between
the haves and have-nots is breaking so many countries, it is in everyone's interest, including the large data companies, to prevent this new form of inequality. Of course, individual data ownership
is not the perfect nor the complete answer to this profoundly complex question of what makes a good digital society. But according to McKinsey, AI will add 13 trillion US dollars
of economic output in the next 10 years. Data generated by individuals
will no doubt contribute to this enormous growth. Shouldn't we at least consider
an economic model that empowers the people? And if private ownership helped
to lift more than 850 million people out of poverty, it is our duty and we owe it to future generations to create a more inclusive AI economy that will empower the people
in addition to businesses. Thank you. (Applause)

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 11, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We have lots in common with our closest
primate relatives. But comparatively, humans seem a bit... 
underdressed. Instead of thick fur covering our bodies, many of us mainly have hair 
on top of our heads— and a few other places. So, how did we get so naked? 
And why do we have hair where we do? Human hair and animal fur 
are made of the same stuff: filaments of the protein keratin that grow
out of organs known as follicles, which go through cycles 
of growth and shedding. Across mammalian species, hairs have been 
modified for numerous purposes, ranging from the soft fluff 
covering rabbits to the rigid quills protecting porcupines. But for many mammals, 
hair grows in two layers consisting of a shorter undercoat 
of ground hairs covered by longer guard hairs. Together, they help insulate 
the animal’s body and protect its skin. Human hairs, on the other hand, are 
kind of a combination of these hair types. Unfortunately, 
hair is rarely found in fossils, making it hard for researchers
to pinpoint when and how our ancient ancestors lost their coats. But scientists have developed
some working hypotheses. It seems that, 
millions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of
trees and adopted a more active lifestyle. Keeping cool became 
increasingly important. Eventually, they developed
more sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating
moisture through the skin. In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat
glands than chimpanzees, for instance. But efficiently losing heat by sweating is
harder to do when you’re covered in fur. Scientists believe that early humans
lost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster. However, if losing our hair
was so advantageous, why do we have any left at all? It seems that there are unique uses 
for hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation 
likely played a part again. Since early humans
began venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed
to the scorching sun. Thicker, longer-growing hair protects
our sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating. Dark tightly curled hair is most effective
at keeping solar radiation off of skin. Other kinds of head hair evolved
as humans moved to different places. Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows 
are especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial
muscles that convey our feelings. Eyelashes have been shown to minimize
airflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying
out and catching debris. And maybe facial hair proved helpful in
distinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...
more pungent. Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas
are dotted with apocrine glands. They produce oily, smelly secretions
which the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots 
helps disperse. The secretions that waft off these hairy
patches may be useful for identification. For example, several studies have shown
that people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those
of people they’re close with. The final type of notable human hair is
the vellus hair that covers our bodies. We don't know if these hairs serve
any purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from
are essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury. They’re also important sites 
of nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain. In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density 
of body hair as apes of comparable sizes. So despite all this talk
of human nakedness, we're not actually as hairless as we look.

distinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...
more pungent. Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas
are dotted with apocrine glands. They produce oily, smelly secretions
which the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots 
helps disperse. The secretions that waft off these hairy
patches may be useful for identification. For example, several studies have shown
that people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those
of people they’re close with. The final type of notable human hair is
the vellus hair that covers our bodies. We don't know if these hairs serve
any purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from
are essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury. They’re also important sites 
of nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain. In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density 
of body hair as apes of comparable sizes. So despite all this talk
of human nakedness, we're not actually as hairless as we look.

**Transcript**:
We have lots in common with our closest
primate relatives. But comparatively, humans seem a bit... 
underdressed. Instead of thick fur covering our bodies, many of us mainly have hair 
on top of our heads— and a few other places. So, how did we get so naked? 
And why do we have hair where we do? Human hair and animal fur 
are made of the same stuff: filaments of the protein keratin that grow
out of organs known as follicles, which go through cycles 
of growth and shedding. Across mammalian species, hairs have been 
modified for numerous purposes, ranging from the soft fluff 
covering rabbits to the rigid quills protecting porcupines. But for many mammals, 
hair grows in two layers consisting of a shorter undercoat 
of ground hairs covered by longer guard hairs. Together, they help insulate 
the animal’s body and protect its skin. Human hairs, on the other hand, are 
kind of a combination of these hair types. Unfortunately, 
hair is rarely found in fossils, making it hard for researchers
to pinpoint when and how our ancient ancestors lost their coats. But scientists have developed
some working hypotheses. It seems that, 
millions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of
trees and adopted a more active lifestyle. Keeping cool became 
increasingly important. Eventually, they developed
more sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating
moisture through the skin. In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat
glands than chimpanzees, for instance. But efficiently losing heat by sweating is
harder to do when you’re covered in fur. Scientists believe that early humans
lost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster. However, if losing our hair
was so advantageous, why do we have any left at all? It seems that there are unique uses 
for hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation 
likely played a part again. Since early humans
began venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed
to the scorching sun. Thicker, longer-growing hair protects
our sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating. Dark tightly curled hair is most effective
at keeping solar radiation off of skin. Other kinds of head hair evolved
as humans moved to different places. Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows 
are especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial
muscles that convey our feelings. Eyelashes have been shown to minimize
airflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying
out and catching debris. And maybe facial hair proved helpful in
distinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...

**Transcript**:
The Trojan War has been raging 
for 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans 
prevailing. Gods and humans alike
are desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races
across the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce. From high up on Olympus you’ve been 
waiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war 
to its conclusion. When you go to consult the Fates,
they advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days,
all will end soon. However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more
devastating years of war. The Fates’ loom has shown them 
the exact conditions that will keep the truce intact. The great Trojan plain can be viewed 
as a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments. If they’re organized in such a way that 
any Greek can reach any other Greek camp without having to pass through a Trojan 
camp, and likewise for Trojans, plus neither side completely surrounds 
the other, peace will prevail. Anyone can move to a horizontally
or vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally. The problem is,
they’re currently arranged like this. Tonight, you can use your powers to swap
up to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally adjacent. No camp can be moved more than once. Which swaps do you make
to keep the peace? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide
this into two sub-problems. There’s the matter of connecting 
4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line. And then there’s dealing 
with the thorny center space. Let’s consider the Greeks first. To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess 
with the nice, straight Trojan lines. If you try to do that anywhere
in the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated
clusters of Trojans. So the only option is to go 
to the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally,
say here, here, and here. Now for the center. there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms 
without swapping a Trojan in. But continuing to shift that arm 
of Trojans inward would require moving 
the same Greek camp multiple times. However, you could shift the whole
Trojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several
solutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver
on the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves. You make the swaps and all is well 
until the fifth night. One of your rival gods wants
to see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage 
of a forgotten prophecy. He’s convinced one Trojan camp 
to make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity. Once again, you consult the Fates,
who prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere
within four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield. They won’t go through with a swap 
if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity. And finally, you can make 
at most two swaps with the same rules as before 
to thwart them. Which swaps do you make 
to block the troublesome Trojan camp? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify
the scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do 
to at least narrow down the options. They have to be somewhere in this area. And they have to be able to block Greek
camps from each other in a single swap. That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages 
are at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole
without opening a new one. So they must be in one of these 
four camps. Let’s look at the right arm first. There’s a threat here because this column 
has two Trojan camps. If one moves to the right, 
the other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing. so we can thwart them by moving either one
a column left into this square. and the same principle applies 
to the bottom arm. Your effort maintains the peace 
for the final 5 days. But it seems that a certain Greek general
noticed what was happening and left the Trojans a parting gift...

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Given the same initial setup, how many "neutralizations" between neighboring camps would be necessary? A camp can participate in only one neutralization. (Please refer to the dig deeper section for the setup figures)
Options: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4, E. 5

**Transcript**:
The Trojan War has been raging 
for 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans 
prevailing. Gods and humans alike
are desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races
across the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce. From high up on Olympus you’ve been 
waiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war 
to its conclusion. When you go to consult the Fates,
they advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days,
all will end soon. However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more
devastating years of war. The Fates’ loom has shown them 
the exact conditions that will keep the truce intact. The great Trojan plain can be viewed 
as a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments. If they’re organized in such a way that 
any Greek can reach any other Greek camp without having to pass through a Trojan 
camp, and likewise for Trojans, plus neither side completely surrounds 
the other, peace will prevail. Anyone can move to a horizontally
or vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally. The problem is,
they’re currently arranged like this. Tonight, you can use your powers to swap
up to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally adjacent. No camp can be moved more than once. Which swaps do you make
to keep the peace? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide
this into two sub-problems. There’s the matter of connecting 
4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line. And then there’s dealing 
with the thorny center space. Let’s consider the Greeks first. To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess 
with the nice, straight Trojan lines. If you try to do that anywhere
in the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated
clusters of Trojans. So the only option is to go 
to the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally,
say here, here, and here. Now for the center. there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms 
without swapping a Trojan in. But continuing to shift that arm 
of Trojans inward would require moving 
the same Greek camp multiple times. However, you could shift the whole
Trojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several
solutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver
on the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves. You make the swaps and all is well 
until the fifth night. One of your rival gods wants
to see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage 
of a forgotten prophecy. He’s convinced one Trojan camp 
to make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, 
or diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity. Once again, you consult the Fates,
who prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere
within four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield. They won’t go through with a swap 
if it only breaks up Trojan connectivity. And finally, you can make 
at most two swaps with the same rules as before 
to thwart them. Which swaps do you make 
to block the troublesome Trojan camp? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify
the scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do 
to at least narrow down the options. They have to be somewhere in this area. And they have to be able to block Greek
camps from each other in a single swap. That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages 
are at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole
without opening a new one. So they must be in one of these 
four camps. Let’s look at the right arm first. There’s a threat here because this column 
has two Trojan camps. If one moves to the right, 
the other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing. so we can thwart them by moving either one
a column left into this square. and the same principle applies 
to the bottom arm. Your effort maintains the peace 
for the final 5 days. But it seems that a certain Greek general
noticed what was happening and left the Trojans a parting gift...

**Transcript**:
You're traveling deep beneath
the ocean's surface, where faint lights flicker
and toothy grins flash. You are now entering... the Twilight Zone. Your mission is to survive these depths and journey to the surface 
after sundown to feed. You may now pick your player. Just kidding— you don’t have a choice. You’re a hatchetfish. And almost everything else 
is trying to eat you. The tools at your disposal 
are a uniquely shaped body, shiny scales, and glowing spots
on your belly. You’re going to need a lot of skill 
and a little luck. Your first challenge is to begin 
your upwards trek. Your swim bladder allows you 
to precisely control your buoyancy. Come nightfall, you slowly fill it up, becoming less dense and rising
towards the surface. You can’t swim fast, but your narrow build
makes you maneuverable. This is especially important since
predators could spring out of the darkness at any moment. In fact, a fangtooth 
is gliding beneath you. It has the ocean’s biggest
tooth-to-body size ratio. Food is hard to come 
by in the Twilight Zone, so predators have fearsome adaptations
to make every attack count. The fangtooth’s skin is ultra-black: it reflects less than 0.5% of the light 
that hits it, making this fish particularly
hard to spot. Fortunately, the bioluminescent organs
lining your belly are regulated to match the intensity and pattern of the 
faint light from the ocean’s surface. This counter-illumination disguises
your silhouette. So when the fangtooth gazes upwards,
you’re almost invisible. A bright spot appears in the distance. You go to check it out, 
but something’s looming in the darkness. The light is a bioluminescent lure
belonging to an anglerfish. You dart away before it quickly
opens its jaws, sucking in a hapless fish 
that got too close. Another narrow escape, 
but you’re nearly there. Although more than 90% 
of deep-sea creatures are bioluminescent, only one group produces the color red: 
dragonfishes. One of them is near. Because red light is quickly absorbed 
by seawater, most deep-sea inhabitants can’t see it. The dragonfish emits red light
from organs by its eyes, using an invisible headlight to locate
unsuspecting prey that its scoops 
into its cavernous jaw. You can’t see your enemy, but your silvery, mirror-like scales
scatter and soften direct light, keeping you hidden. After three close calls, 
you reach... the Photic Zone. You’ve just participated 
in the world’s largest migration. It takes place every night as trillions
of organisms rise from the ocean’s depths to enjoy the surface’s rich resources 
under the cover of darkness. The payoff is huge. Here, your light-sensitive eyes take
in a buffet of small crustaceans and gelatinous zooplankton. During the day, phytoplankton use sunlight
to turn dissolved carbon dioxide into energy and build their own cells. They become food for small grazers,
forming the base of the food web, which extends back down 
to the Twilight Zone— and beyond. Organic matter generated up here—
like bits of skin, poop, and dead animals— eventually sinks or is transported 
in the stomachs of animals returning from their nightly migrations. These materials then feed the creatures
below that don't migrate. This ensures that some of the carbon 
from the atmosphere is locked away in the ocean 
for hundreds of years to come. That's why this process is known
as the biological carbon pump. Without it, there’d be much
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it contributes to climate change. Your avatar, the hatchetfish, 
is part of this crucial process. Your first quest is complete, but you must repeat this journey 
every night for the rest of your life. As the sun rises, 
the surface becomes dangerous, and you descend back into the shadows 
of the Twilight Zone.

are a uniquely shaped body, shiny scales, and glowing spots
on your belly. You’re going to need a lot of skill 
and a little luck. Your first challenge is to begin 
your upwards trek. Your swim bladder allows you 
to precisely control your buoyancy. Come nightfall, you slowly fill it up, becoming less dense and rising
towards the surface. You can’t swim fast, but your narrow build
makes you maneuverable. This is especially important since
predators could spring out of the darkness at any moment. In fact, a fangtooth 
is gliding beneath you. It has the ocean’s biggest
tooth-to-body size ratio. Food is hard to come 
by in the Twilight Zone, so predators have fearsome adaptations
to make every attack count. The fangtooth’s skin is ultra-black: it reflects less than 0.5% of the light 
that hits it, making this fish particularly
hard to spot. Fortunately, the bioluminescent organs
lining your belly are regulated to match the intensity and pattern of the 
faint light from the ocean’s surface. This counter-illumination disguises
your silhouette. So when the fangtooth gazes upwards,
you’re almost invisible. A bright spot appears in the distance. You go to check it out, 
but something’s looming in the darkness. The light is a bioluminescent lure
belonging to an anglerfish. You dart away before it quickly
opens its jaws, sucking in a hapless fish 
that got too close. Another narrow escape, 
but you’re nearly there. Although more than 90% 
of deep-sea creatures are bioluminescent, only one group produces the color red: 
dragonfishes. One of them is near. Because red light is quickly absorbed 
by seawater, most deep-sea inhabitants can’t see it. The dragonfish emits red light
from organs by its eyes, using an invisible headlight to locate
unsuspecting prey that its scoops 
into its cavernous jaw. You can’t see your enemy, but your silvery, mirror-like scales
scatter and soften direct light, keeping you hidden. After three close calls, 
you reach... the Photic Zone. You’ve just participated 
in the world’s largest migration. It takes place every night as trillions
of organisms rise from the ocean’s depths to enjoy the surface’s rich resources 
under the cover of darkness. The payoff is huge. Here, your light-sensitive eyes take
in a buffet of small crustaceans and gelatinous zooplankton. During the day, phytoplankton use sunlight
to turn dissolved carbon dioxide into energy and build their own cells. They become food for small grazers,
forming the base of the food web, which extends back down 
to the Twilight Zone— and beyond. Organic matter generated up here—
like bits of skin, poop, and dead animals— eventually sinks or is transported 
in the stomachs of animals returning from their nightly migrations. These materials then feed the creatures
below that don't migrate. This ensures that some of the carbon 
from the atmosphere is locked away in the ocean 
for hundreds of years to come. That's why this process is known
as the biological carbon pump. Without it, there’d be much
more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it contributes to climate change. Your avatar, the hatchetfish, 
is part of this crucial process. Your first quest is complete, but you must repeat this journey 
every night for the rest of your life. As the sun rises, 
the surface becomes dangerous, and you descend back into the shadows 
of the Twilight Zone.

[Music] I study rumors not tabloid gossip for the kind of rumors that are making stock markets crash or soar but the kind of rumors that affect your health and the world's health like eating a lot of garlic or drinking a lot of water is going to help protect us from coronavirus if only rumors have a bad reputation they're seen as not fact wrong or just a rumor but I've studied rumors for years and one thing I've learned is that they all have a story and often an important story one of the most moving or alarming rumor episodes that I investigated was in northern Nigeria I was working with UNICEF's global immunization program and it wasn't the rumors themselves that I found so alarming it was the global impact of those rumors the rumors were suspecting that the polio vaccine was actually a contraceptive it was controlling populations or maybe it caused AIDS no no maybe it's the CIA spying on them or counting them I mean why else would they have people knocking on their door again and again with the same polio vaccine when children are dying of measles no one was coming with measles vaccines this wasn't about getting the facts right this was about trust was about broken trust why so much distrust it wasn't the mothers who were particularly distrusting actually it was the local leaders the religious leaders the local political leaders it was the governor of the state of Cano who decided to boycott the entire polio eradication effort in that eight for 11 months why such distrust well it was 2003 it was two years after 9/11 and they were convinced that the West and particularly the United States was at war with Muslims and they knew that the West and particularly the United States was a huge supporter and funder of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative they had their reasoning that lack of trust that just a rumor or to cost the polio eradication program 500 million dollars to reset the clock to regain the progress lost during those 11 months and beyond it the Nigerian strain of the polio virus traveled to over 20 countries as far as Indonesia the cost of a rumor the Nigeria episode was one of many episodes that I investigated when I was with UNICEF and earned the title of the director of UNICEF fire department we at that point I realized I never really had enough time I was too busy putting out the fires and not enough time to understand what was driving not just the individual episodes but why was there an epidemic of these happening around the world I left UNICEF and went back to research applied research and I set up in 2010 what I called the vaccine confidence project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine I convened anthropologists epidemiologists psychologists digital media specialists and mathematical modelers we set ourselves the task to investigate historic episodes of rumors and their impacts from trying to figure out what were the early signals what were the amplifying factors and the impacts how did they get traction so we could start to understand what we should be looking for how we could help governments and immunization program be more alert and responsive to early signals of problems it was an early warning system in 2015 we developed a vaccine confidence index it's a it's a survey with trying to investigate to what extent two people agree or disagree that vaccines are important they're safe they're effective they work and somehow they're compatible with my religious beliefs we've run this with over a hundreds of thousands of people around the world trying to get our finger on the pulse of confidence and trust but also more importantly looking at when that trust goes up or down because we want to see when it starts to decline that's the time to jump in to get there before there's a crisis like the Nigerian one we also set up 24/7 media and social media monitoring around the world multi-language listening for what's going on on vaccine conversations trying to pick up early concerns or changes in sentiment that we should be paying attention to we've created an ecosystem of different types of information to try to understand what are the public thinking and how can we engage we look for early signals when we find one we have a global network of collaborators in a number of countries who have more local intelligence in that setting to try to understand is this signal misinformation or something brewing that we should know about in London we have a bigger picture we watched the swarms of rumors not just traveling locally but jumping countries we've seen them jump from Japan over to Colombia through Europe and around they move we live in a hyper-connected environment one of the things that we found fascinating and we've learned a lot in the last 10 years this is our 10th anniversary this didn't start yesterday this rumor problem and one of the things we've learned is in our global monitoring that Europe is the most skeptical region in the world France won the prize actually by far and actually some of those rumors have traveled to other parts of the world but we are trying to understand Europe hmm why Europe I thought the US was really had some of the most skepticism but boy I was wrong and a political scientist a colleague we work with John Kennedy he took our data from 28 European countries and he looked at it and correlated with political opinion polling and what did he find he found that people who were most likely to vote for a populist party also were the ones that most likely to strongly disagree that vaccines were important safe were effective what did we learn vaccines cannot escape the political and social turbulence that surrounds it scientists were unprepared for this tsunami of doubt and questions and distrust what why are vaccines so ripe for resistance well we identified a number of things but one they're highly mediated by government that require regulates and sometimes recommends vaccines or often recommends and

unfettered views concerns anxieties and worries and find a lot of people that think the way they do and think maybe their worries are worth paying attention to and finally vaccines touch every single life on the planet what are their health intervention besides water touches every single life so if you're looking for something to disrupt it's a perfect stage people are asking all kinds of questions they're asking why are vaccines and these are the kinds of things we're hearing in our social media why can't my child have a personalized vaccination schedule what's the wisdom of so many

we feel judged if we ask a question and we even feel demonized that maybe were part of some anti vaccine group so we have some listening to do and maybe that's why last year there was research that found that in six months in 2019 on online this was with hundreds a hundred million different users in social media although the numbers of individuals who expressed in their online groups they were positive as groups the ones who are the most negative were recruiting the conversations in the middle that were undecided about whether they wanted to get vaccines the highly negative what we might call the anti vaccine groups we're recruiting the undecided at a rate 500% faster than the pro-vaccine groups 500% faster they were more nimble they were responsive and they were listening most people believe that vaccines are good and they believe in their importance but that belief is under attack we need to build in more opportunities for conversation and there are ways to do it it's not easy for some health professionals to have conversations where their authority is questioned it's uncomfortable and they're just too busy to listen to all these questions but we need to do something about that because we're losing a lot of concerned parents that just want a conversation we should get volunteers trained to sit in waiting rooms to be on hotlines to have online chat forms to have chat boxes in younger kids with younger kids in school teach them about immune systems and teach them that actually you know that vaccine your little brother got well it just inspired your natural immune system it's a great thing and this is why we need to build that confidence we need to listen despite all this questioning and there's a lot of it I hear probably more than a lot of people I am an optimist and my optimism is with a younger generation the younger generation who actually now are becoming very aware of the risks of social media the false news the false identities and they're starting to embrace science and some of them are a group of children whose mothers refuse to vaccinate them last spring of twenty nineteen eighteen year old Ethan Lindenberg went on reddit and put out a post my mother doesn't believe in vaccines she's really worried they cause autism in fact she strongly believes that but I'm 18 I'm a senior in high school I can drive a car I can vote and I could go get my own vaccine can someone tell me where to get it that post went viral it started to get a whole younger movement going I saw Ethan speak at a conference the global vaccine summit at the EU last fall he spoke eloquently and I was impressed in front of a whole forum and he said he told his personal story and then he said to the group he said you know everybody talks about misinformation but I want to tell you about a different kind of misinformation and that's misinformation that says that people like my mother who is a loving mother is a bad person because she doesn't give me a vaccines well I want to tell all of you that she didn't give me a vaccine because she loves me and because she believed that that was the best thing for me I think differently and I will never change her mind but she's not a bad person that was the message from a teenager empathy kindness and understanding we have an abundance of scientific information to debunk false rumors that's not our problem we have a relationship problem not a misinformation problem misinformation is the symptom not the cause if people trust they'll put up with a little risk to avert a much bigger one the one thing that I want and I hope for is that we as a medical and health community have the moral courage and humility to productively engage like Ethan with those who disagree with us I hope so thank you [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I study rumors not tabloid gossip for the kind of rumors that are making stock markets crash or soar but the kind of rumors that affect your health and the world's health like eating a lot of garlic or drinking a lot of water is going to help protect us from coronavirus if only rumors have a bad reputation they're seen as not fact wrong or just a rumor but I've studied rumors for years and one thing I've learned is that they all have a story and often an important story one of the most moving or alarming rumor episodes that I investigated was in northern Nigeria I was working with UNICEF's global immunization program and it wasn't the rumors themselves that I found so alarming it was the global impact of those rumors the rumors were suspecting that the polio vaccine was actually a contraceptive it was controlling populations or maybe it caused AIDS no no maybe it's the CIA spying on them or counting them I mean why else would they have people knocking on their door again and again with the same polio vaccine when children are dying of measles no one was coming with measles vaccines this wasn't about getting the facts right this was about trust was about broken trust why so much distrust it wasn't the mothers who were particularly distrusting actually it was the local leaders the religious leaders the local political leaders it was the governor of the state of Cano who decided to boycott the entire polio eradication effort in that eight for 11 months why such distrust well it was 2003 it was two years after 9/11 and they were convinced that the West and particularly the United States was at war with Muslims and they knew that the West and particularly the United States was a huge supporter and funder of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative they had their reasoning that lack of trust that just a rumor or to cost the polio eradication program 500 million dollars to reset the clock to regain the progress lost during those 11 months and beyond it the Nigerian strain of the polio virus traveled to over 20 countries as far as Indonesia the cost of a rumor the Nigeria episode was one of many episodes that I investigated when I was with UNICEF and earned the title of the director of UNICEF fire department we at that point I realized I never really had enough time I was too busy putting out the fires and not enough time to understand what was driving not just the individual episodes but why was there an epidemic of these happening around the world I left UNICEF and went back to research applied research and I set up in 2010 what I called the vaccine confidence project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine I convened anthropologists epidemiologists psychologists digital media specialists and mathematical modelers we set ourselves the task to investigate historic episodes of rumors and their impacts from trying to figure out what were the early signals what were the amplifying factors and the impacts how did they get traction so we could start to understand what we should be looking for how we could help governments and immunization program be more alert and responsive to early signals of problems it was an early warning system in 2015 we developed a vaccine confidence index it's a it's a survey with trying to investigate to what extent two people agree or disagree that vaccines are important they're safe they're effective they work and somehow they're compatible with my religious beliefs we've run this with over a hundreds of thousands of people around the world trying to get our finger on the pulse of confidence and trust but also more importantly looking at when that trust goes up or down because we want to see when it starts to decline that's the time to jump in to get there before there's a crisis like the Nigerian one we also set up 24/7 media and social media monitoring around the world multi-language listening for what's going on on vaccine conversations trying to pick up early concerns or changes in sentiment that we should be paying attention to we've created an ecosystem of different types of information to try to understand what are the public thinking and how can we engage we look for early signals when we find one we have a global network of collaborators in a number of countries who have more local intelligence in that setting to try to understand is this signal misinformation or something brewing that we should know about in London we have a bigger picture we watched the swarms of rumors not just traveling locally but jumping countries we've seen them

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, "The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, "Well, now seems good," and the British were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet." Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, "facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions." Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, "Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..." So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, "Yeah, that's gonna work!" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means "shaking off." And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, "The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, "Well, now seems good," and the British were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet." Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, "facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions." Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, "Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..." So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, "Yeah, that's gonna work!" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means "shaking off." And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative.

But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, "The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people," a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,
which Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, "Well, now seems good," and the British were like, "Yeah, but maybe not just yet." Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, "divide and rule" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, "facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions." Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, "Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem..." So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, "Yeah, that's gonna work!" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means "shaking off." And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,
and the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab.

**Transcript**:
A throbbing, pounding headache. Bright zigzagging lines 
across your field of vision. Sensitivity to light, lingering fatigue, 
disrupted sleep. A migraine can include any
of these symptoms. While an incapacitating headache is one of
the most common experiences of migraine, the word “headache” doesn’t really capture
the wide array of experiences a migraine can entail. No two are alike,
and some don’t even involve a headache. So what then is a migraine?
What’s happening in the brain to cause it? To trace a migraine’s anatomy, we have to begin in the days and hours 
leading up to a migraine, when people often identify warning signs 
ranging from fatigue or mood changes, to bursts of yawning,
sleep disruption, nausea, light and sound sensitivity,
or even increased thirst. These warning signs point 
to a particular part of the brain: the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus normally controls 
the systems behind these symptoms— our body’s internal hormonal balances,
circadian rhythms and water regulation. It has wide connections
throughout the brain, and is more active than usual
in the days before migraine. Another common warning sign
is the migraine aura, which can take the form 
of transient visual changes, tingling, or even trouble speaking. These sensations come from a change 
in charge across cell membranes that leads to spreading changes in brain 
activity and blood flow across the brain. We don't know what triggers
this change in charge, but it can spread quickly 
over the surface of the brain, causing different aura symptoms 
depending on the affected area. If it inches over the visual cortex,
for example, it may cause an image or blind spot
to spread over the visual field. During the headache phase, 
the trigeminal nerve plays a key role. The trigeminal nerve normally transmits 
touch, temperature, and other sensations from the skin to most of the face, 
part of the scalp, and some of the blood vessels
and layers covering the cerebral cortex. Once activated, the trigeminal nerve
transmits pain signals. During a migraine, this pain pathway 
becomes sensitized, meaning the threshold for provoking
pain is lowered. Sensations that would usually 
be pain-free, such as coughing, bending over, 
or light and sound, can become painful. Migraines are as common
as they are diverse, affecting as many as 33% of women
and 13% of men in their lifetimes. Still, there’s much we don’t know 
about them. We can see that migraine 
is a neurological disorder affecting multiple parts of the brain— the brainstem, cerebral hemispheres,
and the nerves themselves. But we don't know for sure what
exactly triggers each step, why some people get migraines
and not others, why so many more women do than men, or why people’s migraine patterns
sometimes change over their lifetimes. Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have
a role in some of these things: some women experience a significant
reduction in migraine frequency after menopause, 
when sex hormone fluctuations are fewer. Meanwhile, just before menopause,
these fluctuations increase, and some women experience 
worsening or new headaches. People with migraines
are more likely to suffer from depression, panic disorder, sleep disorders, 
and strokes, among other illnesses. The relationship with these diseases
is likely complex, possibly reflecting the effect of migraine
on those diseases or vice versa, or reflecting their shared genetic basis. Genetics almost certainly play a role,
although with a few exceptions, there’s no single gene 
that causes migraines. Certain genes control how easily 
our brains’ neurons are excited by environmental stimuli and 
how readily they transmit painful signals. It’s possible that the neurons in the 
brains of people who experience migraines are more easily triggered 
by environmental stimuli and less likely to block painful signals. While there’s no simple way to explain 
what happens in our brains with this complex disorder, one thing is for sure:
migraine is much more than a headache.

leading up to a migraine, when people often identify warning signs 
ranging from fatigue or mood changes, to bursts of yawning,
sleep disruption, nausea, light and sound sensitivity,
or even increased thirst. These warning signs point 
to a particular part of the brain: the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus normally controls 
the systems behind these symptoms— our body’s internal hormonal balances,
circadian rhythms and water regulation. It has wide connections
throughout the brain, and is more active than usual
in the days before migraine. Another common warning sign
is the migraine aura, which can take the form 
of transient visual changes, tingling, or even trouble speaking. These sensations come from a change 
in charge across cell membranes that leads to spreading changes in brain 
activity and blood flow across the brain. We don't know what triggers
this change in charge, but it can spread quickly 
over the surface of the brain, causing different aura symptoms 
depending on the affected area. If it inches over the visual cortex,
for example, it may cause an image or blind spot
to spread over the visual field. During the headache phase, 
the trigeminal nerve plays a key role. The trigeminal nerve normally transmits 
touch, temperature, and other sensations from the skin to most of the face, 
part of the scalp, and some of the blood vessels
and layers covering the cerebral cortex. Once activated, the trigeminal nerve
transmits pain signals. During a migraine, this pain pathway 
becomes sensitized, meaning the threshold for provoking
pain is lowered. Sensations that would usually 
be pain-free, such as coughing, bending over, 
or light and sound, can become painful. Migraines are as common
as they are diverse, affecting as many as 33% of women
and 13% of men in their lifetimes. Still, there’s much we don’t know 
about them. We can see that migraine 
is a neurological disorder affecting multiple parts of the brain— the brainstem, cerebral hemispheres,
and the nerves themselves. But we don't know for sure what
exactly triggers each step, why some people get migraines
and not others, why so many more women do than men, or why people’s migraine patterns
sometimes change over their lifetimes. Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have
a role in some of these things: some women experience a significant
reduction in migraine frequency after menopause, 
when sex hormone fluctuations are fewer. Meanwhile, just before menopause,
these fluctuations increase, and some women experience 
worsening or new headaches. People with migraines
are more likely to suffer from depression, panic disorder, sleep disorders, 
and strokes, among other illnesses. The relationship with these diseases
is likely complex, possibly reflecting the effect of migraine
on those diseases or vice versa, or reflecting their shared genetic basis. Genetics almost certainly play a role,
although with a few exceptions, there’s no single gene 
that causes migraines. Certain genes control how easily 
our brains’ neurons are excited by environmental stimuli and 
how readily they transmit painful signals. It’s possible that the neurons in the 
brains of people who experience migraines are more easily triggered 
by environmental stimuli and less likely to block painful signals. While there’s no simple way to explain 
what happens in our brains with this complex disorder, one thing is for sure:
migraine is much more than a headache.

**Transcript**:
What’s as big as a polar bear, 
swallows its prey whole, and swims at 40 miles an hour? It’s not a shark or a killer whale. It’s the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The largest and longest-lived
of the 15 tuna species, the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set
of adaptations that make it one of the most dominant 
predators in the ocean. It starts as a tiny hatchling in the 
Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea, no bigger than a human eyelash. Within its first year of life, It develops something known as 
regional endothermy— the ability to regulate
its body temperature. An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen 
from cold ocean water using its gills. This process cools its blood. Then, heat the tuna generates swimming 
and hunting warms the blood. In most fishes, this heat would be lost
back out into the ocean through the gills. But in the Atlantic bluefin, a mechanism called countercurrent exchange
traps the heat. Cold blood on its way 
to the large swimming muscles passes close to warm blood 
leaving those muscles in a specialized network of blood vessels 
known as a rete mirabile. Here the heat “jumps” to the cold blood
and stays in the body. This makes bluefin one of the few 
warm-blooded fishes, a huge advantage 
in the marine environment. Cold-blooded animals whose 
body temperature depends entirely on the environment become
sluggish in colder waters. But a bluefin’s ability to keep warm
means it has sharper vision, can better process information,
and can swim faster than its prey. It thrives in cold, deep, subarctic water. Thanks to their warm bloodedness, 
their powerful muscles, and their streamlined torpedo shape with fins that fold into grooves 
to reduce drag, bluefin tuna can reach speeds
few other animals can match. Their maximum speed of 40 miles per hour is faster than that of a great white shark
or orca whale, and even at their comfortable 
cruising speed, they can cross the Atlantic
in a couple months. All this swimming requires
a great deal of oxygen, but the bluefin is adapted
for this as well. The faster it swims, the more water
passes over its gills, and the more oxygen it can absorb
from that water. This need for a constant flow of water means the tuna must always remain 
on the move. It also means bluefin cannot suck prey 
into their mouths the way most other fishes do. Instead, they must chase down 
their prey with their mouths open. They eat smaller prey than most predators
their size, including squid, crustaceans,
and smaller fish species like mackerel. The bluefin’s temperature-regulating
ability doesn’t just make it a superior hunter— 
it gives it nearly unlimited range. As soon as they’re strong enough to swim
against the current, Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters 
of their spawning grounds and spend their lives hunting
all over the Atlantic Ocean. Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Mediterranean Sea frequent the same feeding grounds and range from Brazil and Texas 
to Iceland and Senegal and beyond. But when the time comes
to reproduce around age 10, they always return to their sea of origin. Here, groups of males and females release
millions of eggs and sperm into the water. They’ll migrate back and forth between 
feeding and spawning grounds annually for the rest of their lives. Atlantic bluefin can live 
for over 40 years, growing all the while. The largest specimens are tens of millions
of times heavier than when they hatched. The same huge size that makes
bluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean has made them vulnerable
to one predator in particular: us. Humans have a long history

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

**Transcript**:
What’s as big as a polar bear, 
swallows its prey whole, and swims at 40 miles an hour? It’s not a shark or a killer whale. It’s the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The largest and longest-lived
of the 15 tuna species, the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set
of adaptations that make it one of the most dominant 
predators in the ocean. It starts as a tiny hatchling in the 
Gulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea, no bigger than a human eyelash. Within its first year of life, It develops something known as 
regional endothermy— the ability to regulate
its body temperature. An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen 
from cold ocean water using its gills. This process cools its blood. Then, heat the tuna generates swimming 
and hunting warms the blood. In most fishes, this heat would be lost
back out into the ocean through the gills. But in the Atlantic bluefin, a mechanism called countercurrent exchange
traps the heat. Cold blood on its way 
to the large swimming muscles passes close to warm blood 
leaving those muscles in a specialized network of blood vessels 
known as a rete mirabile. Here the heat “jumps” to the cold blood
and stays in the body. This makes bluefin one of the few 
warm-blooded fishes, a huge advantage 
in the marine environment. Cold-blooded animals whose 
body temperature depends entirely on the environment become
sluggish in colder waters. But a bluefin’s ability to keep warm
means it has sharper vision, can better process information,
and can swim faster than its prey. It thrives in cold, deep, subarctic water. Thanks to their warm bloodedness, 
their powerful muscles, and their streamlined torpedo shape with fins that fold into grooves 
to reduce drag, bluefin tuna can reach speeds
few other animals can match. Their maximum speed of 40 miles per hour is faster than that of a great white shark
or orca whale, and even at their comfortable 
cruising speed, they can cross the Atlantic
in a couple months. All this swimming requires
a great deal of oxygen, but the bluefin is adapted
for this as well. The faster it swims, the more water
passes over its gills, and the more oxygen it can absorb
from that water. This need for a constant flow of water means the tuna must always remain 
on the move. It also means bluefin cannot suck prey 
into their mouths the way most other fishes do. Instead, they must chase down 
their prey with their mouths open. They eat smaller prey than most predators
their size, including squid, crustaceans,
and smaller fish species like mackerel. The bluefin’s temperature-regulating
ability doesn’t just make it a superior hunter— 
it gives it nearly unlimited range. As soon as they’re strong enough to swim
against the current, Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters 
of their spawning grounds and spend their lives hunting
all over the Atlantic Ocean. Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico 
and the Mediterranean Sea frequent the same feeding grounds and range from Brazil and Texas 
to Iceland and Senegal and beyond. But when the time comes
to reproduce around age 10, they always return to their sea of origin. Here, groups of males and females release
millions of eggs and sperm into the water. They’ll migrate back and forth between 
feeding and spawning grounds annually for the rest of their lives. Atlantic bluefin can live 
for over 40 years, growing all the while. The largest specimens are tens of millions
of times heavier than when they hatched. The same huge size that makes
bluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean has made them vulnerable
to one predator in particular: us. Humans have a long history
of fishing Atlantic bluefin— it’s even stamped on ancient Greek coins. But in recent decades, 
demand has skyrocketed as bluefin are hunted for sashimi, sushi, 
and tuna steaks. An individual fish can sell 
for $10,000 or more, promoting overfishing and illegal fishing. But if recent conservation efforts are
redoubled and quotas are better enforced, bluefin populations can begin to recover.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 21, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your eyes get heavy and gradually... 
close... But wait! It’s only lunchtime
and you still have so much to do. Would taking a nap help?
Or would it derail your day? Our sleep, both at night and in naps, is made up of approximately 90 minute
sleep cycles with four stages each. A nap can last anywhere from five minutes
to three hours, so it can include full sleep cycles
or just a few stages. As you fall asleep, you enter Stage 1:
the first two to five minutes of sleep. Stage 2 comes next, for about 30 minutes. In Stage 2, body temperature drops, 
muscles relax, and breathing and heart rate 
become more regular. Your neurons start to fire in unison, creating waves of activity 
that sweep across the cortex, punctuated by rapid bursts 
of neural activity called sleep spindles. As you enter Stage 3,
or slow wave sleep, the rolling waves increase as your neurons
fire in coordination. This phase lasts about 20 to 30 minutes
and is where your deepest sleep occurs. Then, you enter REM sleep, which lasts
about 10 to 20 minutes in a nap. In REM, the brain becomes more active,
more like your brain activity while awake. The end of REM signals 
the completion of a sleep cycle. OK, but will a nap make you feel better? Well, that depends on a few things— especially what stages of sleep
the nap includes. Take a 30 minute nap, 
which consists mainly of Stage 2 sleep. Stage 2 sleep is associated 
with long-term potentiation, a process that's thought to strengthen
the synapses between neurons, which is essential for learning. A 20 to 30 minute nap stops short
of Stage 3′s deep sleep, making it relatively easy to wake up from. A 30 to 60 minute nap, meanwhile,
has the benefits of Stage 2 sleep and also takes you into the deeper sleep 
of Stage 3. During Stage 3, multiple brain areas
work together to transfer information from short-term memory storage
to long-term storage, stabilizing and strengthening 
long-term memory by coupling sleep spindles 
with slow waves. Stage 3 is the most difficult stage 
to wake up from. So while a 30 to 60 minute nap
can have cognitive benefits, those benefits often don’t kick in until 
about 15 minutes after waking up. 60 to 90 minute naps enter the REM stage. While in REM, the prefrontal cortex, which is largely responsible 
for inhibition and cognitive control, becomes much less active. Meanwhile, the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex, regions associated with emotion 
and motivation, are highly active. Researchers have posited that 
the combination of these things leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep: the decrease in inhibition and cognitive
control might lead to wild associations— and, thanks to the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex activity, those associations can be 
between emotionally charged topics. Some researchers think this stage might
help us make innovative connections between ideas upon waking. Because the brain activity during
REM is closer to waking, it may be easier to wake up from REM 
than Stage 3, even though the nap is longer. The time of day also matters. Our need for deep Stage 3 sleep 
progressively increases throughout the day. So if you nap later, you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure
needed to go to sleep at night. This doesn't happen for REM sleep. Longer periods of REM occur
during morning hours, so morning naps are dominated by REM, midday naps have about equal parts
of REM and deep sleep, and evening naps contain more deep sleep. On top of all this, it seems 
that we’re just about evenly split between nappers and non-nappers. Nappers consistently show
cognitive benefits from napping, but non-nappers may not. Researchers think this could be 
because nappers are able to stay in a lighter sleep
and move through sleep stages more easily. Meanwhile, non-nappers may experience
more deep sleep while napping, making them groggy afterward. So will a nap help? Well, there’s only one way to find out...

of Stage 3′s deep sleep, making it relatively easy to wake up from. A 30 to 60 minute nap, meanwhile,
has the benefits of Stage 2 sleep and also takes you into the deeper sleep 
of Stage 3. During Stage 3, multiple brain areas
work together to transfer information from short-term memory storage
to long-term storage, stabilizing and strengthening 
long-term memory by coupling sleep spindles 
with slow waves. Stage 3 is the most difficult stage 
to wake up from. So while a 30 to 60 minute nap
can have cognitive benefits, those benefits often don’t kick in until 
about 15 minutes after waking up. 60 to 90 minute naps enter the REM stage. While in REM, the prefrontal cortex, which is largely responsible 
for inhibition and cognitive control, becomes much less active. Meanwhile, the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex, regions associated with emotion 
and motivation, are highly active. Researchers have posited that 
the combination of these things leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep: the decrease in inhibition and cognitive
control might lead to wild associations— and, thanks to the amygdala 
and cingulate cortex activity, those associations can be 
between emotionally charged topics. Some researchers think this stage might
help us make innovative connections between ideas upon waking. Because the brain activity during
REM is closer to waking, it may be easier to wake up from REM 
than Stage 3, even though the nap is longer. The time of day also matters. Our need for deep Stage 3 sleep 
progressively increases throughout the day. So if you nap later, you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure
needed to go to sleep at night. This doesn't happen for REM sleep. Longer periods of REM occur
during morning hours, so morning naps are dominated by REM, midday naps have about equal parts
of REM and deep sleep, and evening naps contain more deep sleep. On top of all this, it seems 
that we’re just about evenly split between nappers and non-nappers. Nappers consistently show
cognitive benefits from napping, but non-nappers may not. Researchers think this could be 
because nappers are able to stay in a lighter sleep
and move through sleep stages more easily. Meanwhile, non-nappers may experience
more deep sleep while napping, making them groggy afterward. So will a nap help? Well, there’s only one way to find out...

**Transcript**:
According to legend, 
when this planet was young and molten, three galactic terraformers
shaped it into a paradise. When their work was done, 
they sought out new worlds, but left the source of their power behind: three powerful golden hexagons, hidden within dungeons 
full of traps and monsters. If one person were to bring all
three hexagons together, they could reinvent the world
however they saw fit. That was thousands of years ago. Today, you’ve learned of Gordon, an evil 
wizard dead set on collecting the hexagons and enslaving the world to his will. So you set off on a quest 
to get them first, adventuring through fire, ice, and sand. Yet each time, you find that someone else 
got there first. Not Gordon, but a merchant named Dongle. At the end of the third dungeon. you find
a note inviting you to Dongle’s castle. You show up with a wallet bursting 
with the 99 gems you’ve collected in your travels, arriving just moments before Gordon, 
who also has 99 gems. Dongle has not only collected 
the golden hexagons, but he’s used them to create 
5 silver hexagons, just as powerful 
as their golden counterparts. Why did Dongle do all this? Because there’s one thing he loves
above all else: auctions. You and the evil wizard will compete
to win the hexagons, starting with the three golden ones, making one bid for each item 
as it comes up. The winners of ties will alternate, 
starting with you. Whoever first collects a trio 
of either golden or silver hexagons can use their power to recreate the world. You’ve already bid 24 gems on the first, when you realize that your rival
has a dastardly advantage: a mirror that lets him see
what you’re bidding. He bids zero, 
and you win the first hexagon outright. What’s your strategy to win a matching
trio of hexagons before your rival? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Dongle’s dangled a difficult dilemma. Do you spend big to try to win 
the golden hexagons outright? Save as much as possible for silver?
Or something in-between? Gordon can use his magic mirror 
and 99 gems to make sure that no matter what you bid 
on the second gold, he can bid one more and block you. So the real question is— how can you force
Gordon to spend enough on the golds to guarantee that you’ll win
on the silvers? Here’s a hint. Let’s say at the start 
of the silver auctions you had a one gem advantage, 
such as 9 to 8. You need to win three auctions, so could you divide your gems 
into three groups of three and win? For simplicity, let’s assume 
a set of rules that’s worse for you, where Gordon wins every tie. If you bid 3 each time, 
the best he could do is win two silver hexagons, 
and have two gems left— which you’ll beat with
three bids of 3. Any one-gem advantage where your
starting total is divisible by three will lead to victory by the same logic. So knowing that, how can you force
Gordon's hand in the gold auctions so you go into silver with an advantage? Let’s first imagine that Gordon lets 
you win the second gold auction by betting some amount X with a tie. You could then bid everything you have
left on the third gold hexagon, and he'd have to match you to block. So if you could bid 51 on the third gold, you'd go into silver with a 51 to 48
advantage, which you know you can win. Solving for X reveals that in order
to have 51 on round three, you should bid at most 24 on round two. But what about the other possibility, where Gordon wins the second gold 
against your bid of 24— would this strategy still work? The least he could bid to win
the second gold is 25, making the total 75 to Gordon’s 74. No one would then bid on round three, since you’ve each blocked the other 
from getting three golds. After that, you could bid 25 
every time to win three silvers. The bidding war was close, but your ingenuity kept you one link
ahead in the chain of inference, and the silver tri-source is yours. Now... what will you do with it?

**Transcript**:
Welcome to It Hurts! One of these creatures is thought 
to possess the world’s most painful insect sting. If you were to guess, would it be: the ant that forages 
in rainforest canopies? The bee that protects a hive
of delectable honey? Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas? Let’s find out! Ant, bee, and wasp venoms contain 
a variable cocktail of compounds designed to incite unsavory sensations 
and even compromise bodily functions. Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt’s 
sting pain index describes and ranks the pain 
of around 100 kinds of insect stings. One of our three competitors
claims the nastiest one. First, let’s consider 
the Western honeybee’s sting, Schmidt says it’s like “a flaming 
match head has landed on your arm and is quenched first with lye 
and then sulfuric acid.” This discomfort is accomplished with venom that’s packed with a pain-causing 
peptide called “melittin” and flesh-softening enzymes
that disperse the venom. These enzymes may also cause 
allergic reactions and even lead to fluid buildup 
in the lungs. Because worker honeybees have barbed 
stingers that burrow into certain victims, they usually can't sting without leaving
part of their bodies behind, which ultimately kills them. Since only the queen bee has 
the ability to reproduce, a worker bee’s self-sacrifice helps 
ensure that the colony— and their genes— will prevail. But before they go, they release an alarm pheromone
that activates a mass attack and often targets some of the most 
vulnerable sites on their victim’s body. The tarantula hawk wasp sting is, 
as Schmidt says, “blinding, fierce, shockingly electric ...
A bolt out of the heavens. Lie down and scream.” The sensation might last just 5
agonizing minutes for humans, but it leaves tarantulas— the wasp’s
preferred target— permanently paralyzed. After the wasp stings a tarantula, 
aiming for a crucial bundle of nerves, it lays an egg on the immobilized spider. Once hatched, the wasp’s larva spends
its formative days in the bountiful environment 
of the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem
to do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider 
as fresh meat for the wasp’s offspring. The rainforest-dwelling bullet ant’s sting
yields “pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over a flaming bed 
of charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded 
in your heel,” according to Schmidt. And this torture
often lasts more than 12 hours. A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin that our bodies struggle to degrade 
is what makes the pain last so long. In addition to agony, poneratoxin can 
induce trembling, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, 
and even an abnormal heartbeat. The bullet ant is, in fact, crowned 
with the most painful insect sting. It's thought that they may have evolved
such an excruciating defense because they forage in rainforest canopies
loaded with predators looking for proteinaceous snacks. They can’t simply jump or fly away, so perhaps they’re better off with this
reliable, rather off-putting weapon. The tarantula hawk wasp’s formidable sting clocks in as the second most painful 
on the scale. And it’s likely the reason this wasp 
has no known predators. Honeybee stings are in the middle 
of the pain scale. But when many sting simultaneously, what might’ve felt manageable at first
becomes all the more dangerous. In fact, insect stings helped enable
the evolution of complex colonies that would otherwise represent
an easy feast to predators. Some stinging insects are, of course,
more aggressive than others, but most of the time, they only sting us 
when we provoke them. The truth hurts.

becomes all the more dangerous. In fact, insect stings helped enable
the evolution of complex colonies that would otherwise represent

**Transcript**:
Welcome to It Hurts! One of these creatures is thought 
to possess the world’s most painful insect sting. If you were to guess, would it be: the ant that forages 
in rainforest canopies? The bee that protects a hive
of delectable honey? Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas? Let’s find out! Ant, bee, and wasp venoms contain 
a variable cocktail of compounds designed to incite unsavory sensations 
and even compromise bodily functions. Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt’s 
sting pain index describes and ranks the pain 
of around 100 kinds of insect stings. One of our three competitors
claims the nastiest one. First, let’s consider 
the Western honeybee’s sting, Schmidt says it’s like “a flaming 
match head has landed on your arm and is quenched first with lye 
and then sulfuric acid.” This discomfort is accomplished with venom that’s packed with a pain-causing 
peptide called “melittin” and flesh-softening enzymes
that disperse the venom. These enzymes may also cause 
allergic reactions and even lead to fluid buildup 
in the lungs. Because worker honeybees have barbed 
stingers that burrow into certain victims, they usually can't sting without leaving
part of their bodies behind, which ultimately kills them. Since only the queen bee has 
the ability to reproduce, a worker bee’s self-sacrifice helps 
ensure that the colony— and their genes— will prevail. But before they go, they release an alarm pheromone
that activates a mass attack and often targets some of the most 
vulnerable sites on their victim’s body. The tarantula hawk wasp sting is, 
as Schmidt says, “blinding, fierce, shockingly electric ...
A bolt out of the heavens. Lie down and scream.” The sensation might last just 5
agonizing minutes for humans, but it leaves tarantulas— the wasp’s
preferred target— permanently paralyzed. After the wasp stings a tarantula, 
aiming for a crucial bundle of nerves, it lays an egg on the immobilized spider. Once hatched, the wasp’s larva spends
its formative days in the bountiful environment 
of the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem
to do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider 
as fresh meat for the wasp’s offspring. The rainforest-dwelling bullet ant’s sting
yields “pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over a flaming bed 
of charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded 
in your heel,” according to Schmidt. And this torture
often lasts more than 12 hours. A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin that our bodies struggle to degrade 
is what makes the pain last so long. In addition to agony, poneratoxin can 
induce trembling, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, 
and even an abnormal heartbeat. The bullet ant is, in fact, crowned 
with the most painful insect sting. It's thought that they may have evolved
such an excruciating defense because they forage in rainforest canopies
loaded with predators looking for proteinaceous snacks. They can’t simply jump or fly away, so perhaps they’re better off with this
reliable, rather off-putting weapon. The tarantula hawk wasp’s formidable sting clocks in as the second most painful 
on the scale. And it’s likely the reason this wasp
