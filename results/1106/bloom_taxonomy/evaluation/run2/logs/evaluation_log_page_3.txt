Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the charge against Nelson Mandela when he was arrested in 1956. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this event or the specific charge.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6. Although it does not ask about the 1956 arrest, it does ask about a condition offered to Mandela for his release from prison, which is related to his imprisonment and the charges against him.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 6 is only a distant approximation.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (with the caveat that it's not a close match)

we squeezed a the spear of the nation called us Caesar was formed after Sharpeville when 67 people were killed men women and children and over 180 were wounded during a peaceful demonstration it is at that time that Mandela realized and it was a very difficult decision for him that nonviolent resistance was not enough since he was wanted by the government he traveled abroad secretly gaining support for the cause when he returned to South Africa he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison while in prison he was also charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government Mandela stood trial but refused to defend himself because this would legitimize the state's case Mandela received a life sentence to be served in the prison on Robben Island a desolate Rock Island seven miles off the coast of Cape Town instead of being forgotten in jail Mandela became a symbol for the movement to end apartheid during the 1980s several offers of release were made to Mandela on the condition that he renounce violence he refused in February of 1990 the government declared the ANC legal and announced Mandela was to be released here's this man who hasn't been seen for over a quarter century walking out into the world now free at the age of 71 Mandela was named the head of the ANC his work to help bring an end to apartheid earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 in 1994 for the first time in more than 300 years blacks in South Africa would have the opportunity to vote for their rulers at the age of 75 Mandela was elected president in a landslide becoming the president I think he really really moved the world because this was a place that most of us didn't think would ever see black leadership and so for him to rise to power after being in jail for 27 years I think it was just a really historical moment Mandela proved to be a master politician knowing when to be unyielding and when to compromise unfortunately his marriage to Winnie came to an end in 1996 in 1998 Mandela married his third wife on his 80th birthday the following year he stepped down as president of the ANC Nelson used his stature to help mediate the civil war in Burundi he continues to work with human rights organizations and for AIDS awareness and I think that he will be known as you know one of the peaceful freedom fighters of our time Nelson Mandela continues to be a defining symbol of how one man can truly make a difference in the world

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the charge against Nelson Mandela when he was arrested in 1956. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this event or the specific charge.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6. Although it does not ask about the 1956 arrest, it does ask about a condition offered to Mandela for his release from prison, which is related to his imprisonment and the charges against him.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 6 is only a distant approximation.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Nelson Mandela's age when he was released from prison, while Question 6 asks about the condition offered to Mandela for his release from prison in 1990. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to Mandela's release from prison.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Mandela's age at the time of his release. If I had to choose the most similar question based on the available options, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 6

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a new question that directly asks about Mandela's age at the time of his release would be a more accurate match.

**Transcript**:
[Applause] now I've been around Sydney and I've asked people what causes the phases of the moon and you know what they say how do we get the faces of the Moon uh because of the the Earth blocks the the light that comes from the Sun a full moon is basically where we're seeing the full uh circle of the Moon reflected back to Earth but the light is actually coming from the Sun and the Cresent with the crants are caused by the Shadows of the Earth from the Sun onto the moon the phases of the moon is that about the Sun and the Moon and the and the something goes in front of something the Earth between this moon and the sun we won't see the moon and then it as it goes around the earth gets out of the way so More Of The Sun Shines on the moon and we can see the moon I think so let's try to resolve it what really causes the phases of the moon phases of the moon um for we need to know a couple of things first one is there's only one source of light in the solar system and that's the Sun so at the center of the solar system it produces all the light so both the Earth and the moon are half illuminated by that one source of light as the moon moves around the earth our perspective on it changes because sometimes we see just the unlet face of the moon when the moon is between us and the sun that's a new moon other times we'll see the moon has moved around the earth and we see the moon half illuminated and half dark we'd call that first quar water at other times still when the moon is moved further around the earth we see the full illuminated face of the Moon and we call that full moon but it's just because the Moon is half illuminated by the Sun and it's our perspective on that half illuminated Moon which gives the phases why doesn't the Earth block the light when we're seeing a full moon you know if it's Sun Earth Moon why doesn't the Earth block out the light so we can't see the moon you would think that would happen every full moon you would think the Earth the moon would go through the Earth's Shadow at every full moon but in fact the moon's orbit is tilted slightly to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun how much is it tilted by about 5° so virtually every Full Moon the Moon is moving just above or just below the Earth's Shadow I'm here with Andrew Jacobs at the cydney observatory and we've just witnessed a total lunar eclipse so can you tell me what that is so total lunar eclipse is when normally there would be a full moon but the full moon happens when the moon is in Earth's Shadow so the Moon is passed through Earth's shadow um it's gone through the outer fainter part of the Shadow gone into the inner darker part and turned red so why does it look red when it's in the middle of Earth Shadow ah there three three effects here going on one is that the Earth's atmosphere is refracting the light into towards the moon bit like a prism is it bit like a prism yes exactly like that um it the blue light however is being scattered out by the Earth's atmosphere just like a sunset you see a red sunset because the blue light is scattered outwards um so that leaves the red light preferentially to get through to the moon and then if there's dust perhaps volcanic dust in the Earth's atmosphere that dims the light so um leads to either a brighter or darker red color on the face of the moon what can we use the lunar eclipse 4 why is it important to us a few years ago I would have said it was had no importance at all not much importance anyway beautiful thing to look at but not much scientific importance but nowadays um we know that there are planets orbiting around other stars alien ex exoplanets we call them and if we can measure um the light that's going through Earth's atmosphere and reflecting off the Moon it can give us an idea of what we might expect to see if the light is coming through the atmosphere of an exoplanet orbiting around another star so we can use the observations of a lunar eclipse around the earth to infer what's what the atmosphere of a exoplanet may be like we can detect things like ozone or carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere by looking at the Spectrum that reflects off the moon and if we see a similar Spectrum when we look at a exoplanet around another star we could infer there is um ozone or carbon dioxide in that atmosphere could you detect water vapor as well you could detect water vapor as well yes and that would obviously be a pretty exciting sign if we saw that that would be a very exciting sign yes yes all those things together and perhaps a methane as well might suggest that there's life out there in the universe what

[coughing sounds]
This is how COVID-19 is spread. Through air currents, potentially carrying
microscopic droplets full of coronavirus. When we talk. Breathe. Or cough. We can see this thanks to an imaging technique
that lets us peer into the invisible world of airflow. And using this same technique, we can see
if masks really do help to stop the spread of coronavirus [MUSIC] Hey smart people, Joe here. If you’ve been feeling confused about masks,
what they do, what they don’t do, and whether or not you should wear one – I hope this
video will help. And since I’m all by myself at the moment,
I don’t need to wear this. Or this. This is Matthew Staymates, a fluid dynamicist
and mechanical engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And while stuck at home he turned his garage
into a lab. Using a technique called schlieren imaging
he captured some incredible images of a world invisible to our eyes. If you’ve ever seen wavering distortions
above a hot road, that fluttery mirage happens because different temperatures and densities
of air bend light in different ways, like a fluid lens. And when we talk, warm air streams out of
our mouths meeting the sea of colder air around us. A schlieren setup lets us see these tiny differences. A narrow source of light is bounced off a
concave mirror towards a camera, with a thin metal blade blocking some of the focused light. As that light interacts with air in the space
between, it’s bent in ever-so-slightly different ways, creating shadows and bright spots in
the final image. As you can see in this Veritasium video from
my friend Derek, it lets us see everything from shockwaves to heat rising off a candle. And at 250 frames per second, it shows us
exactly why masks work to slow airborne infection. Now, it’s important to remember that we
can’t see viral particles in these images. They are too small. But the viruses are carried on that breath
just like a river carries fish. In fact, an individual viral particle is smaller
than the weave of most fabrics. So why does this work? Well, masks help in two interesting ways. First, it’s important to understand that
viruses don’t float around alone. They fly out in droplets of moisture. Most droplets are heavy enough that they fall
within 2 meters or so, but any person or object within that distance can get bathed in virus. And without a mask, some of those droplets
can evaporate into super tiny particles of infection that can float on air currents far
from your mouth or nose, and these microdroplets are extremely hard for any mask to filter
out. But with a mask on, in the warm, humid space
between your mouth and the mask, those larger droplets don’t have time to evaporate, and
they can be captured by common fabrics. If it feels hot and humid in here, that means
it’s working. And the second way masks work, is that any
droplets that do get through now have less momentum. The air currents disperse in eddies and swirls
instead of flowing away in streams, which means droplets won’t travel as far. So, which mask is the best mask? If it seems like recommendations change all
the time, that’s because doctors and scientists know more now than they did months ago. And they will know more months from now, than
they do today. Which is exactly how science is supposed to
work. What we do know is whether you’re using
a bandana, an N95 mask, or a cloth mask you sewed at home, they all still have a lot of
droplet-blocking power. But that mask has to fit. This is almost like not wearing a mask at
all. A mask that’s too tight, or has too many
thick layers can actually force more air out the sides. A good test is to see if you can blow a candle
out through your mask from about 1 foot away. [blowing] These schlieren images are clear evidence
that masks are effective. But the best science relies on multiple lines
of evidence. Here's an experiment that we did with a person
talking through a sheet of laser light, illuminating all of the microdroplets released as we speak. With a mask, those droplets are all caught. And this microbiologist sneezed, sang, talked,
and coughed over petri dishes. A simple mask blocked nearly all of the germs,
and even though this experiment detected bacteria and not viruses, they both leave our airway
in the same respiratory droplets. It should be pretty clear to you now why masks
work, and the body of research that proves that is getting stronger all the time. Links down in the description! But really, the most important question is
why should you wear a mask? You know, it’s often said that masks aren’t
to keep you from getting sick, but to keep you from getting others sick. Wearing a mask can dramatically reduce the
chance of spreading COVID. But that’s a strange thing to think about,
because you might think “Well, I’m not sick, I’ve got a strong immune system…
so I don’t need to wear this.” But we know that COVID-19 can go undetected,
and almost half of infections may come from people who don’t show symptoms. That could be you. Or it could be the person next to you. And if it is, wouldn’t you want them wearing
a mask? They probably feel the same way about you. Can masks harm your health, like lowering
your body’s oxygen levels? No, that’s a myth, and it’s been tested
over and over again by healthcare workers who work all day in masks. And masks won't stop the pandemic on their
own. They’re best used in combination with other
safety measures, like handwashing and physical distancing. Stereotypically "macho" people have actually
been shown to resist masks more. I get it: Dudes, you don’t feel cool, even
though lots of cool dudes wear masks. Or maybe your nose itches, and your glasses
fog up, your face is sweaty. No fun. I get it. For most people wearing masks is new, and
weird, and different. But there are lots of things that used to
be weird and different, until everyone just started doing them. I mean umbrellas used to be viewed as completely
feminine accessories for rich people, and only to shade the sun. Until one day some masculine men decided they
were tired of getting rained on and suddenly enough people were using umbrellas that they
became like the most boring, socially acceptable thing ever. It's true, look it up. Most people didn’t use condoms in sexual
relationships until the risks of HIV and other infections pushed people to change their behavior,
and now it’s not only normal, it’s a way to say I respect you, and I want to protect
both of us. This is also a sign you want to protect others
and have them protect you. And the sooner that this becomes part of everyone’s
normal, everyday life, the sooner we can all get back to normal, everyday life. In every pandemic in history, it’s the actions
and choices of individual people that have made the difference. A mask can stop a virus, but it also sends
a message: We’re all in this together. And that’s something we all need to hear
right now and every day. Stay curious. Thanks for watching this video and I hope
that you'll send it to somebody that you know that needs to hear this message. But remember, what we know from social psychology
is that shaming people into wearing masks, that's not going to work. SO come at it with an open mind and an open
heart, and we can all do this together. And like always, I'd like to thank everyone
who supports the show on Patreon. We couldn't do it without you, this video
or any other video. And we're so glad especially now to have your
support. If you'd like to join our community, there's

you're here this week. See you next time.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever had someone try to explain something
to you a dozen times with no luck – but, then, when you see a picture, the idea finally
clicks? If that sounds familiar, maybe you might consider
yourself a visual learner. Or, if reading or listening does the trick,
maybe you feel like you’re a verbal learner. We call these labels learning styles, but
is there /really/ a way to categorize different types of students? Well, it actually seems like /multiple/ presentation
formats, especially if one of them is visual, help most people learn. When psychologists and educators test for
learning styles, they’re trying to figure out whether these are inherent traits that
affect how well students learn, instead of just a preference. Usually, they start by giving a survey to
figure out what style a student favors, like visual or verbal learning. Then, they try to teach the students something
with a specific presentation style, like using visual aids, and do a follow-up test to see
how much they learned. That way, the researchers can see if the self-identified
verbal learners really learned better when the information was just spoken aloud, for
example. But, according to a 2008 review, only /one/
study that followed this design found that students actually learned best with their
preferred style… And it had some pretty big flaws. The researchers excluded two-thirds of the
original participants because they didn't seem to have /any/ clear learning style from
the survey at the beginning. Plus, they removed outliers from the data
if they thought they were “extreme,” without defining exactly what that meant. And, they didn't even report the actual test
scores in the final paper. So ... it doesn’t really seem like learning
styles are an inherent trait that we all have. But, that doesn't mean that all students will
do amazingly if they just spend all their time reading from a textbook. Instead, /most people/ seem to learn better
if they’re taught in several ways – especially if one is visual. In one study, researchers tested whether students
remembered lists of words better if they heard them, saw them, or both. And everyone seemed to do better if they got
to see the words in print, even the self-identified auditory learners. That preference didn't seem to matter. Similar studies tested whether students learned
basic physics and chemistry concepts better by reading plain text or viewing pictures,
too. And everyone did better with the help of pictures. So the question of whether or not you're a
visual learner could best be answered with: "Well, yeah, kinda. But so are most people." Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to

The study excluded participants who didn't seem to have a clear learning style, C. The study did not control for extraneous variables, D. The study did not report the actual test scores Correct Option: B
Question 10: What is the primary implication of the transcript's findings for educators? Options: A. Educators should focus on identifying and catering to individual learning styles, B. Educators should use a combination of teaching methods to reach all students, C. Educators should prioritize verbal explanations over visual aids, D. Educators should allow students to choose their preferred learning style and provide materials accordingly Correct Option: B

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, an even more similar question is Question 8, but Question 3 is a more direct match in terms of the specific context (a teacher teaching a concept in physics). 

But if we consider the overall intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is about what makes any learning aid most effective, Question 7 and Question 8 are also very similar.

However, another question that is very similar in terms of the options is Question 8. 

So the most similar question is Question 8: A teacher wants to create an inclusive learning environment that caters to different learning styles. What would be an effective approach? Options: A. Providing separate lessons for visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learners, B. Using a combination of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic teaching methods, C. Allowing students to choose their preferred learning style and providing materials accordingly, D. Focusing primarily on verbal explanations and providing additional support for students who need it Correct Option: B

But if we consider only the content of the question, we can say that Question 3 is the most similar.

However, I will choose Question 8 because the ground truth MCQ asks about what makes any learning aid most effective and the correct option is "Using it in combination with other learning aids", which is very similar to the correct option in Question 8 which is "Using a combination of visual, auditory, and kinesthetic teaching methods".

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 8, but as explained above, it can also be 3 or 7 depending on how we interpret the similarity.

**Transcript**:
Whether you're watching an entire Netflix series in one sitting, or playing the newest Zelda from start to finish, most of us spend a significant time in front of screens. But is binge watching bad for your brain and body? In the past, it may have actually been deadly. In 1967, an error in manufacturing led to the selling of TVs which emitted harmful X-Rays with radiation levels 100,000 times higher than what is considered safe today. But even modern televisions cause a strain on your eyes. Under normal circumstances, humans blink around 18 times per minute, but when staring at a screen, this rate decreases drastically causing sore and tired eyes. Fortunately, these symptoms are generally short-term. In children, however, simply spending extended hours indoors can have developmental effects. A condition called Myopia, where the eyes cannot focus properly, is seen much more frequently in children who spend more time inside. Not only are you constantly forced to focus on nearby objects as opposed to far off landscapes and distances, but scientists believe that the sun itself may actually play a role in healthy eye regulation. And while TV may feel like a nice way to relax your body and brain, that may not always be a good thing. Not only is a sedentary lifestyle a major contributor to obesity, but studies have shown that people who watch less TV tend to burn more calories, even if they aren't doing more physical activity. Simply doing more mentally rigorous tasks like reading, playing a board game, or simple household activities, requires more energy and burns more calories. And if you want to truly relax, TV before bed may also be hurting you. Studies have shown that it may actually reduce the hours of quality sleep, contributing to chronic sleep debt. It may also affect other bedtime activities. Researchers have found that those who watch more than 20 hours of TV a week have, on average, a 44% reduction in sperm. But perhaps the most significant findings relate directly to your life span. Not only is there a documented correlation between TV viewing time and risk for diabetes and heart disease, but as shocking as it may be, multiple studies have found a correlation between TV viewing time and ALL causes of death.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the effects of staring at a screen, it does relate to the information provided in the transcript regarding the normal blinking rate for humans under normal circumstances. According to the transcript, staring at a screen decreases the blinking rate, which can cause sore and tired eyes. Question 2 provides the baseline for this information by asking about the normal blinking rate.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would directly ask about the effects of staring at a screen on the blinking rate. Since such a question is not available, Question 2 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Whether you're watching an entire Netflix series in one sitting, or playing the newest Zelda from start to finish, most of us spend a significant time in front of screens. But is binge watching bad for your brain and body? In the past, it may have actually been deadly. In 1967, an error in manufacturing led to the selling of TVs which emitted harmful X-Rays with radiation levels 100,000 times higher than what is considered safe today. But even modern televisions cause a strain on your eyes. Under normal circumstances, humans blink around 18 times per minute, but when staring at a screen, this rate decreases drastically causing sore and tired eyes. Fortunately, these symptoms are generally short-term. In children, however, simply spending extended hours indoors can have developmental effects. A condition called Myopia, where the eyes cannot focus properly, is seen much more frequently in children who spend more time inside. Not only are you constantly forced to focus on nearby objects as opposed to far off landscapes and distances, but scientists believe that the sun itself may actually play a role in healthy eye regulation. And while TV may feel like a nice way to relax your body and brain, that may not always be a good thing. Not only is a sedentary lifestyle a major contributor to obesity, but studies have shown that people who watch less TV tend to burn more calories, even if they aren't doing more physical activity. Simply doing more mentally rigorous tasks like reading, playing a board game, or simple household activities, requires more energy and burns more calories. And if you want to truly relax, TV before bed may also be hurting you. Studies have shown that it may actually reduce the hours of quality sleep, contributing to chronic sleep debt. It may also affect other bedtime activities. Researchers have found that those who watch more than 20 hours of TV a week have, on average, a 44% reduction in sperm. But perhaps the most significant findings relate directly to your life span. Not only is there a documented correlation between TV viewing time and risk for diabetes and heart disease, but as shocking as it may be, multiple studies have found a correlation between TV viewing time and ALL causes of death. One study concluded that every hour spent in front of the TV may cut as much as 22 minutes off your life. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, and you can have a healthy relationship with TV if consumed in moderation like anything else.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks for the name of the condition (Myopia) without inquiring about the reason it is seen more in children who spend too much time inside.

A more suitable match would be a question that not only mentions Myopia but also asks about the reason for its increased occurrence in children who spend more time indoors. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content, I would suggest Question 3, as it at least mentions Myopia.

**Transcript**:
This is Horseshoe Bend. It’s a stunning view of a U-turn in the
Colorado River near the border of Arizona and Utah. In the early 90s, this spot was a hidden gem
— accessible by an unmarked dirt trail off the side of the highway. Locals described it as “nearly empty”
— and that “hardly anybody knew about it.” But over the years, its popularity grew: first
slowly... … and then suddenly. Until it became this. In this past this used to be that this place would get maybe a few thousand visitors every single year. Now, that number is more like 1.5 million. And it keeps growing. That change didn’t happen because of any
big marketing push. It happened because of geotagged pictures
like these. Digital popularity is physically changing
the landscape. This place — and other public lands like
it — are trying to adjust. Social media — I believe — was the
main trigger. That explosion — just — has been overwhelming. You can see that social media explosion when
you look at the rate of Google searches for Horseshoe Bend. But it isn't the only previously-hidden spot
that's become internet famous. Similar increases have happened at Devil’s
Bathtub, a swimming hole in Virginia... … Kanarraville Falls, a waterfall trail
in Utah... … and Vance Creek Bridge, an old railroad
overpass in Washington. So why are these places getting so much attention? For outdoor photographers searching for the
perfect shot, Instagram made things easy: The app’s interface put geotagging — the
practice of attaching location data to a picture — front and center. And if a hidden spot didn’t already have
a location tag available, anyone could create one. These Instagram hotspots were often located
either just outside protected lands, or far off the beaten path. So as America’s National Parks became more
popular than ever, these places started getting National
Park-level crowds without having National Park-level infrastructure. Federally protected areas require a ton of
planning and work to keep people and the environment safe. There wasn't a developed trail here. There weren't any restroom facilities. There was no railing. It was an undeveloped site. Without that infrastructure, the natural landscape
can be damaged — and people following geotagging trends are at risk of injury or death. At Conundrum Hot Springs in Colorado, visitors
disturbed wildlife, cut down trees for firewood, and left behind an overwhelming amount of
human waste. And at Kaaterskill Falls in New York, at least
four people have died while taking or posing for pictures. So at Horseshoe Bend, trail designers are
getting to work. The park service and the city of Page are
creating over 400 parking spaces, a welcome center, bathrooms, a viewing deck with safety
railings, and laser-equipped signs to count attendance. And they’re building a new ADA-compliant
trail, lined with limestone to protect the surrounding environment and reinforced with
magnesium chloride to keep gravel in place. Throughout the trail, all the improvements
that we're doing are aimed at creating as natural an environment as possible. It's a difficult balance. You're not going to stop people from going
to the rim's edge and trying to capture that iconic photo. We don't want to wall it off. So all we can do is implore that people be safe. For places like Kanarraville Falls in Utah,
that concern for safety extends to their residents, too. The town’s water comes from a spring near
the falls, where’s it’s piped to tanks near the canyon entrance. It used to be a local secret — but in 2016,
40,000 people hiked that trail, disturbing the water source and leaving debris behind. It shares so quick, and it gets out
there so fast, that people can look at it and say “Oh wow, look at that!” Then they tap on the photo, and it’ll tell
where it was from or where it was taken. Things like that, and people go wild over it. You can imagine what that does to
the canyon floor, the trail, the water — people in and out. We've just tried to take adequate measures
to try to work with the ecosystem, and not have it ruin our water source. Others are taking a different approach: there’s
now a growing movement in the nature photography scene against geotagging. So, in 1999 this organization called Leave
No Trace came up with a set of guidelines for people to use while they’re in the outdoors. These are things like don’t leave trash
behind, don’t interfere with wildlife, leave everything as it was when you saw it. And now in 2018 they’ve announced that they’re
encouraging people not to geotag photos while they’re in nature. We’ve always had the tendency to explore
— and sometimes be irresponsible in nature. Modern technology just amplifies those
urges. With so many natural wonders at our fingertips
today, it’s even more urgent that we treat them with respect and care — before it’s
too late. Hi there – thanks for watching The Goods,

**Transcript**:
This is Horseshoe Bend. It’s a stunning view of a U-turn in the
Colorado River near the border of Arizona and Utah. In the early 90s, this spot was a hidden gem
— accessible by an unmarked dirt trail off the side of the highway. Locals described it as “nearly empty”
— and that “hardly anybody knew about it.” But over the years, its popularity grew: first
slowly... … and then suddenly. Until it became this. In this past this used to be that this place would get maybe a few thousand visitors every single year. Now, that number is more like 1.5 million. And it keeps growing. That change didn’t happen because of any
big marketing push. It happened because of geotagged pictures
like these. Digital popularity is physically changing
the landscape. This place — and other public lands like
it — are trying to adjust. Social media — I believe — was the
main trigger. That explosion — just — has been overwhelming. You can see that social media explosion when
you look at the rate of Google searches for Horseshoe Bend. But it isn't the only previously-hidden spot
that's become internet famous. Similar increases have happened at Devil’s
Bathtub, a swimming hole in Virginia... … Kanarraville Falls, a waterfall trail
in Utah... … and Vance Creek Bridge, an old railroad
overpass in Washington. So why are these places getting so much attention? For outdoor photographers searching for the
perfect shot, Instagram made things easy: The app’s interface put geotagging — the
practice of attaching location data to a picture — front and center. And if a hidden spot didn’t already have
a location tag available, anyone could create one. These Instagram hotspots were often located
either just outside protected lands, or far off the beaten path. So as America’s National Parks became more
popular than ever, these places started getting National
Park-level crowds without having National Park-level infrastructure. Federally protected areas require a ton of
planning and work to keep people and the environment safe. There wasn't a developed trail here. There weren't any restroom facilities. There was no railing. It was an undeveloped site. Without that infrastructure, the natural landscape
can be damaged — and people following geotagging trends are at risk of injury or death. At Conundrum Hot Springs in Colorado, visitors
disturbed wildlife, cut down trees for firewood, and left behind an overwhelming amount of
human waste. And at Kaaterskill Falls in New York, at least
four people have died while taking or posing for pictures. So at Horseshoe Bend, trail designers are
getting to work. The park service and the city of Page are
creating over 400 parking spaces, a welcome center, bathrooms, a viewing deck with safety
railings, and laser-equipped signs to count attendance. And they’re building a new ADA-compliant
trail, lined with limestone to protect the surrounding environment and reinforced with
magnesium chloride to keep gravel in place. Throughout the trail, all the improvements
that we're doing are aimed at creating as natural an environment as possible. It's a difficult balance. You're not going to stop people from going
to the rim's edge and trying to capture that iconic photo. We don't want to wall it off. So all we can do is implore that people be safe. For places like Kanarraville Falls in Utah,
that concern for safety extends to their residents, too. The town’s water comes from a spring near
the falls, where’s it’s piped to tanks near the canyon entrance. It used to be a local secret — but in 2016,
40,000 people hiked that trail, disturbing the water source and leaving debris behind. It shares so quick, and it gets out
there so fast, that people can look at it and say “Oh wow, look at that!” Then they tap on the photo, and it’ll tell
where it was from or where it was taken. Things like that, and people go wild over it. You can imagine what that does to
the canyon floor, the trail, the water — people in and out. We've just tried to take adequate measures
to try to work with the ecosystem, and not have it ruin our water source. Others are taking a different approach: there’s
now a growing movement in the nature photography scene against geotagging. So, in 1999 this organization called Leave
No Trace came up with a set of guidelines for people to use while they’re in the outdoors. These are things like don’t leave trash

off an annual premium subscription! [♪ INTRO] Imagine: You’re having a good time 
around a fire when out of nowhere, the smoke blows straight into your face. Naturally, you just get up, 
you move to get out of the way. You go back to having a good time again, and the smoke is suddenly 
blowing right back in your face! It was over there when I was over there! Now I’m over here, it’s over here! You and the people near you, you move out 
of the way, everything’s fine for a bit. Until, once again, your eyes start to sting. Eventually, everyone gets huddled in the one place that seems like it’s been smoke free. But you know what happens next. Your friends say that you are cursed because you brought the 
smoke with you as you moved. There is no curse, which is honestly too bad. Because curses can be broken, 
but laws of physics cannot. So all that smoke starts with fire. And fires release a lot of energy as heat, and air molecules nearby absorb some 
of that heat and start to move faster. Since temperature is just an 
average measurement of how much energy molecules have, that means 
the air starts heating up too. Those speedy molecules collide 
with their slower neighbors and send those neighbors flying 
off in the opposite direction, freeing up space for the hot 
air near the fire to expand. This whole chain of events 
results in the air near the fire becoming less dense than the air around it. Now, you may have heard that 
less-dense air rises, and that is true. It's usually better to live 
on the top floor in the winter and in the basement in the summer. You also may have heard that less-dense air rises because it weighs less than the air it replaces, which is also true, but it's more 
of a definition than an explanation. It just means that less-dense air 
rises because it's less dense. The reason dense stuff sinks is because as you get farther above the ground, there 
is less and less air above you. So air down at the ground has 
to push with a lot of force to support the weight of all the air above it. And it's not just air! Everything down here at the ground pushes 
against the weight of the air above it. Now, if you were light enough that the 
force of gravity on your body pulled you down less than that air pushed you up, 
you would lift off like a hot air balloon. But you’re not: gravity pulls you 
down more than the air pushes you up. So you sink. The hot air around a fire, on the other 
hand, is less dense than the air around it. Gravity pulls it down less than 
the air around it pushes it up, and it rises into the sky. This is called convection. It happens 
in the Sun; it happens in the Earth; it happens in your oven, whether 
or not you have a convection oven. And, most importantly, it happens around a fire. And the real key to understanding why 
smoke keeps blowing in your face is that the rising air doesn’t just rise on its own. It is pushed by the air around it. Because when hot air moves away from 
the fire, the air that pushed it keeps right on going and fills the 
gap that the hot air left behind. And this is where you come in. You might think that you’re just sitting 
by the fire roasting some marshmallows. The fire is affecting you, but 
you’re not affecting the fire. But you are. You form a wall that creates a kind of vacuum. If you were not there, air that 
comes from where you’re sitting and air that comes from across the fire 
would meet up at the fire and stop there. But you are there, so your body blocks the air behind you from moving toward the fire. So there’s nothing to stop the air coming 
toward you from moving right on through the fire and into your face, bringing any 
smoke or soot from the fire along with it. And since it’s you that’s blocking the air, 
you block the air wherever you move to. Even more annoyingly, the 
vacuum is stronger when you have more people in one place because more 
people block more of that airflow. So you’re better off on your own 
than huddled with your friends if you want to avoid getting all 
that smoke in your eyes and lungs. Or you could just get rid of 
the smoke in the first place. Then, the vacuum would just 
send warm air your way. And that’s the idea behind smokeless fire pits. Smoke is mostly compounds in 
wood that didn’t burn completely, either because the fire isn’t hot enough 
or because there isn’t enough oxygen. Smokeless fire pits solve the second 
problem by creating additional paths for incoming air, reducing or even eliminating 
how much smoke a fire produces. If that’s not an option, your next 
best bet is to bring a protractor. And the more protractors, the better the party. That’s what I always say. Without any outside wind, having 
everyone spaced out equally means that the same amount of air 
is blocked from all directions, and nobody’s vacuum is 
stronger than anyone else’s. It’s really like a perfect 
pandemic activity: you’re outside, you’re breathing into a fire 
plus, if you get too close to your friend, you get punished with 
a bunch of smoke in your eyes. And if you’re looking for some

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the wording of the question is slightly different, the intent and content of the question are the same as the ground truth MCQ. The correct option (C) in Question 2 also provides a more detailed explanation of why less-dense air rises, which is mentioned in the transcript as the reason why the initial explanation (it weighs less) is more of a definition than an explanation.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question wording and options. If we were to look for a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely in terms of wording and options, we might consider Question 2 to be the closest match, but with some modifications to the question and options to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
[ INTRO ] It’s advice as old as time: if you get a
sunburn, start lathering on the Aloe Vera. And when we say ‘old as time’, we mean
it. Humans have been using aloe vera medicinally
for thousands of years. But does the slimy gel actually have skin-healing
properties? Well, the research is surprisingly scarce,
but it seems like it may help boost your skin’s natural healing process. Sunburns themselves really aren’t all that
different than burns from a campfire, a curling iron, or stepping on a George Foreman grill. So studies looking at burn healing tend to
lump them together. And there is some evidence that applying the
mucus innards from Aloe plants helps you heal faster after a burn. A review from 2007 in the journal Burns found
that in 127 burn victims, those who used aloe healed almost 9 days faster on average than
those in control groups. But what aloe actually does is a little less
clear. In general, there are three main concerns
when treating burns: reducing pain, actually healing the wound, and preventing infection. Aloe’s antibacterial and antifungal activities
are well documented, so it might simply help because it keeps pesky microbes at bay. But ask just about anyone who slathers on
the aloe after a sunburn, and they’ll swear it’s an analgesic, meaning that it reduces
pain. And that might be because it reduces inflammation—your
body’s immune response that makes things like sunburns all red and painful. For example, an experiment in 1993 was able
to isolate an enzyme in aloe that breaks down bradykinin, an inflammatory substance linked
with pain. But there’s not all that much clinical research
on aloe pain-killing effects, so the jury is still out on whether they’re real, or
it’s just acting as a placebo. There’s a bit more evidence that it boosts
skin healing. Studies in rats have shown that aloe extract
helps new skin cells move into burned areas, so they can rebuild the damaged tissue. And the gooey gel in aloe vera contains a
large amount of glucomannan, a fiber comprised mostly of the sugar mannose, which stimulates
the production of fibroblastic growth factor. It helps stimulate the formation of collagen
and new blood vessels, which speed up how quickly the skin heals. That said, human studies to date are kind
of flimsy. A 2012 Cochrane review noted that the few
trials that have been conducted aren’t high quality—they’re all small, and their results
are potentially biased by things the patients or caregivers knowing aloe was being used. So, it might work, or it might just be that
people think it’ll work. And when it comes to your over the counter
sunburn gel, it might not even be the aloe itself. Researchers have found that it can speed up
that absorption of vitamins and drugs through the skin. So if your aloe gel also has things like Vitamin
E, or some other anti-inflammatory drug, that substance gets into your skin faster. But whether aloe works or not, I think we
can all agree it’s just better to avoid needing it. So if you’re going to spend some time in
the sun this summer, maybe take steps to avoid overexposure instead of relying on aloe to
soothe your beet-red skin afterwards. Thanks to Joelle and Brianna Beecher for asking,

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 4 only addresses one aspect of the ground truth MCQ (potential anti-inflammatory properties), I also considered other generated MCQs that might cover the remaining aspects. 

Question 3 addresses the antibacterial and antifungal properties indirectly by mentioning preventing infection as one of the main concerns when treating burns. Question 6 addresses the properties of glucomannan, which is related to the soothing nature of aloe.

Considering the options and content of the generated MCQs, I couldn't find a single question that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 4, as it is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

[SQUEAKING] [POP] Check this out. I'm just gonna drag this plate
through the water in the pool. That's it. But look what forms--
perfect black circles on the bottom of the pool. And it's so weird. They don't die. They just keep going
right next to each other. I sped this footage
up because the circles took 3 minutes to cross
the pool and didn't seem to be dying out. These got sharper as they went
and made it all the way across. So cool. And look closer. You can see what's causing them. There are two almost
unnoticeable dips in the surface of the water. Why don't they die out? And how do these
dark spots form? And why do the
dips move together? So many questions. Let's first look
at what they are. When I dragged the
plate through the water, you could see it
forming little vortices, like you get when you move
a paddle through the water. A vortex is a gas
or a liquid moving in circles with what we
call a vortex line going up through the circles. They are everywhere--
tornadoes, water flowing down the drain, hurricanes,
or the movement of air over an airplane wing. Vortices often form when there's
a difference in fluid speed, like fast wind moving
over slow wind. As you move the plate
forward, the water right next to the boundary
moves with the plate because of friction. The water further
out is not moving. It's that difference in velocity
that causes a shear force and starts the water spinning. This is accentuated by the water
in front of the plate being forced around the
sides and the water behind the plate
being sucked forward as the plate moves along. In this coherent
vortex, our dips can travel much further
across the pool than a ripple without dissipating. Why? The vortex wants to keep
its angular momentum. So it continues spinning as
it moves through the water and only loses some
energy through friction to the surrounding
stationary water. So what we appear to
have here is two vortices moving across the pool. But it seems weird that
they stay right together. Well, when we
create this vortex, we're forcing water to move
around the whole plate, not just on the
surface of the water. Our vortex line is curved. We're creating a
half vortex ring. You know, like a smoke ring,
bubble ring, or even the plume rising up from an
explosion, but half of that. These two dips on
the water's surface are just the ends
of the half ring. They're connected. And that's why
they stay together. We can see this if we put
a little food coloring into the ends. The food coloring travels
from one end to the other. And you can see the
entire half ring. So cool. We just made a bubble
ring without the bubble. This also tells you
something interesting. The half ring is not a wave. A wave is a disturbance
moving through a medium that transfers energy but
doesn't transfer matter. When we added food
coloring, we saw clearly that the vortex is
transferring matter, just like a smoke ring does. So sadly, it's not a wave. It's cooler than a wave. Now back to this
half-ring vortex. Isn't it weird? You've probably never seen
half of a smoke ring before. Why? Well, according to
Helmholtz's law, a vortex line cannot
start or end in a fluid. So a vortex line either
wants to close into a loop or end at a boundary. If you tried to cut
a smoke ring in half, it would either break
up or, even cooler, it would break up into
two smaller smoke rings. I don't know if that happens. It would be awesome. Since the line can't end in the
fluid, it ends at the surface. You almost never see
these half vortices though because
they have to occur on the boundary of two media. If you can think of another
way to make the entire half ring visible, like a smoke ring
or a bubble ring, let me know. So now, why does our vortex
create those cool dark spots? Well, the balance between
gravity, centripetal forces, and surface tension
creates a funnel shape which acts like a lens. Lenses often work by
focusing light to a point, like this Fresnel lens, which
can melt pennies in the sun. But I digress. Our vortex lenses focus the
sunlight away from the center, like so. And you have a bright ring
surrounding a dark circle. The ring highlights the
dark circle further. And you get these incredibly
clear black spots. So cool. Now I highly recommend
trying this at home, especially if it's too
cold to swim in the pool. Here are some tips. The water has to be very still. Even a small breeze makes
it harder to create these. The sun has to be
out, or it won't work. And you can try some
other really cool things. Send your vortices at a wall. You'll see the dark
spots spread out. Or try colliding two of them. Happy physics-ing. [THEME MUSIC]

[SQUEAKING] [POP] Check this out. I'm just gonna drag this plate
through the water in the pool. That's it. But look what forms--
perfect black circles on the bottom of the pool. And it's so weird. They don't die. They just keep going
right next to each other. I sped this footage
up because the circles took 3 minutes to cross
the pool and didn't seem to be dying out. These got sharper as they went
and made it all the way across. So cool. And look closer. You can see what's causing them. There are two almost
unnoticeable dips in the surface of the water. Why don't they die out? And how do these
dark spots form? And why do the
dips move together? So many questions. Let's first look
at what they are. When I dragged the
plate through the water, you could see it
forming little vortices, like you get when you move
a paddle through the water. A vortex is a gas
or a liquid moving in circles with what we
call a vortex line going up through the circles. They are everywhere--
tornadoes, water flowing down the drain, hurricanes,
or the movement of air over an airplane wing. Vortices often form when there's
a difference in fluid speed, like fast wind moving
over slow wind. As you move the plate
forward, the water right next to the boundary
moves with the plate because of friction. The water further
out is not moving. It's that difference in velocity
that causes a shear force and starts the water spinning. This is accentuated by the water
in front of the plate being forced around the
sides and the water behind the plate
being sucked forward as the plate moves along. In this coherent
vortex, our dips can travel much further
across the pool than a ripple without dissipating. Why? The vortex wants to keep
its angular momentum. So it continues spinning as
it moves through the water and only loses some
energy through friction to the surrounding
stationary water. So what we appear to
have here is two vortices moving across the pool. But it seems weird that
they stay right together. Well, when we
create this vortex, we're forcing water to move
around the whole plate, not just on the
surface of the water. Our vortex line is curved. We're creating a
half vortex ring. You know, like a smoke ring,
bubble ring, or even the plume rising up from an
explosion, but half of that. These two dips on
the water's surface are just the ends
of the half ring. They're connected. And that's why
they stay together. We can see this if we put
a little food coloring into the ends. The food coloring travels
from one end to the other. And you can see the
entire half ring. So cool. We just made a bubble
ring without the bubble. This also tells you
something interesting. The half ring is not a wave. A wave is a disturbance
moving through a medium that transfers energy but
doesn't transfer matter. When we added food
coloring, we saw clearly that the vortex is
transferring matter, just like a smoke ring does. So sadly, it's not a wave. It's cooler than a wave. Now back to this
half-ring vortex. Isn't it weird? You've probably never seen
half of a smoke ring before. Why? Well, according to
Helmholtz's law, a vortex line cannot
start or end in a fluid. So a vortex line either
wants to close into a loop or end at a boundary. If you tried to cut
a smoke ring in half, it would either break
up or, even cooler, it would break up into
two smaller smoke rings. I don't know if that happens. It would be awesome. Since the line can't end in the
fluid, it ends at the surface. You almost never see
these half vortices though because
they have to occur on the boundary of two media. If you can think of another
way to make the entire half ring visible, like a smoke ring
or a bubble ring, let me know. So now, why does our vortex
create those cool dark spots? Well, the balance between
gravity, centripetal forces, and surface tension
creates a funnel shape which acts like a lens. Lenses often work by
focusing light to a point, like this Fresnel lens, which
can melt pennies in the sun. But I digress. Our vortex lenses focus the
sunlight away from the center, like so. And you have a bright ring
surrounding a dark circle. The ring highlights the
dark circle further. And you get these incredibly
clear black spots. So cool. Now I highly recommend
trying this at home, especially if it's too
cold to swim in the pool. Here are some tips. The water has to be very still. Even a small breeze makes
it harder to create these. The sun has to be

other really cool things. Send your vortices at a wall. You'll see the dark
spots spread out. Or try colliding two of them. Happy physics-ing. [THEME MUSIC]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

This question asks about the main difference between a wave and a vortex, which aligns with the intent of the ground truth MCQ. The correct option, A, states that "A wave transfers energy, while a vortex transfers matter," which directly relates to the explanation in the transcript that the half-ring vortex is not a wave because it transfers matter, not just energy.

Although Question 7 is not a direct true/false question like the ground truth MCQ, its content and options address the same concept and provide a clear distinction between waves and vortices, making it the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
If you look at the wake behind a duck, or
a kayak, or a ship, you might notice two unusual things: first, the wake isn’t simple (like
the perfectly straight shock wake of a supersonic projectile is) - it’s a fascinating, feathery,
ripple-y pattern. And second, that feathery pattern looks the
same - same angle, same repeating pattern of ripples along the edge, same reverse arcs
in the middle - it looks more or less the same regardless of whether it’s made by
a duck, a kayak or a ship, even though they’re all moving at different speeds and the waves
are very different sizes. The reason water wakes always have this particular
shape and pattern is because of the surprising physics of water waves. While there's a single speed of light waves,
and a single speed of sound waves, there's no single speed of water waves. In water, longer waves travel faster, while
shorter waves travel slower. This phenomenon where different wavelength
waves travel at different speeds is known as dispersion, and it makes water waves both
interesting and complicated. Like a boat wake. To explain the shape of a boat wake, we’ll
start by looking at water waves of just a single wavelength (and speed). A boat traveling across this simpler water
creates a series of circular waves - if the water waves are faster than the boat, the
waves encircle it, but you don’t get a wake. If the waves are slower than the boat, the
boat outruns them and the circles all add together to create a V-shaped wake. And if the waves are even slower, the boat
will outrun them even more and they’ll add together to a narrower V shape. Slower waves make narrower wakes. Faster waves make wider wakes. But we need to remember that water waves are
waves, that is, they repeat themselves. So every circular wave is really the first
of a series of circular waves. This means that instead of creating just one
v-shaped wake, a moving boat creates a train of v-shaped wakes that are each exactly one
wavelength apart. The reason a real boat doesn’t make straight
v-shaped wakes is that a real boat makes waves of many different wavelengths. And because of dispersion, different wavelengths
travel at different speeds: the longer ones travel faster and shorter ones travel slower. Faster waves create wider wakes, and because
faster waves also have longer wavelengths, that means that wider wakes are further apart. Similarly, slower waves create narrower wakes,
and because slower waves also have shorter wavelengths, narrower wakes are closer together. When you add together narrow, closely spaced
wakes, with wider, more widely spaced wakes, with even wider, even more widely separated
wakes, and so on, voilá! The shape of a boat wake! Look at the beautiful repeating feathery ripples
out on the edge, and the wider repeating arcs inside the wake itself. If you replace these sharp lines with smoother
waves at the appropriate angles and spacings, you get an even more convincing boat wake. And we can do the same again in 3D to get
a really realistic-looking boat wake. So in summary: wakes have the shape they do
because water waves travel at different speeds. Slower water waves create narrow, closely
spaced V-shaped wakes, and faster water waves create wider V-shaped wakes that are further
apart. When you add all these different v-shaped
patterns together, at the correct angles and spacings determined by water's dispersion
relation, you end up with the unique shape of a water wake. SPONSORSHIP MESSAGE:

This episode is supported by Edx. Termites, prairie dogs, and people are all
great builders, each in their own way. And we all share one crucial problem. Put a bunch of us in a closed space, breathing
Oxygen in and CO2 out… and it doesn’t end well. Our tallest skyscrapers and deepest mines
are almost completely cut off from outside air. To keep those inside from suffocating, human
engineers use giant machines to bring in fresh air and pump stale air out. Termite mounds have the same problem. The largest are more than 10 meters high. On a human scale, that’s like a skyscraper
three and a half kilometers tall! Only instead of condos and offices, it holds
one big farm. The termites collect wood, which grows fungus,
that the termites eat. All that fungus and the millions of termites
that tend to it create a ton of CO2, which would suffocate the colony *and* their crops
if it builds up. To keep the air fresh, the whole mound acts
like a big lung. During the day, the sun heats the outer chambers
more rapidly than the core, moving air up the outside and down the middle. During the night, this current reverses as
the outer chambers lose heat to the cool night air. The whole time, CO2 and oxygen are exchanged
through tiny holes in the outer walls. What’s amazing is this is all constructed
without a boss. No central architect designing the structure. Just instinct and cooperation lets termites
build huge ventilation engines powered by nothing but daily temperature cycles. Leafcutter ants farm fungus on massive scales
too. One colony in South America covered nearly
50 square meters and was home to over 8 million ants! But unlike those towering termites, the ant
labyrinth reached 8 meters underground. So how do they ventilate their agricultural
city? Before we answer that, I want you to try something. Take a piece of paper, hold it under your
lips, and let the other end curl down. If you blow only across the top of the paper,
what do you think will happen? The force of the air hitting the paper should
push it down, right? Well watch this. Here’s what’s happening: Air is a fluid. When I force air across the top of the paper,
that stream pulls other air along, due to viscosity, which is like the friction of
fluids. This leaves an area of low pressure behind, and the paper is pulled up to fill
it. This is called the Coandă effect. What does that have to do with ants? Check this out. When a breeze flows over a hill, the air is
deflected over the top. This pulls air along too, just like when I blew over the paper, drawing air out of the ant hill along the
way. The ants build lower entrances nearby, where
air is drawn in to replace it, ventilating the whole colony with a little breeze. Prairie dogs get the same effect from their
mounds. Breezes over taller hills draw air through
the connected tunnel system, keeping the whole town breathing fresh. There’s even a tiny shrimp that uses this
same system to keep fresh water flowing through its burrows. Persian and Egyptian architects have used

**Transcript**:
This episode is supported by Edx. Termites, prairie dogs, and people are all
great builders, each in their own way. And we all share one crucial problem. Put a bunch of us in a closed space, breathing
Oxygen in and CO2 out… and it doesn’t end well. Our tallest skyscrapers and deepest mines
are almost completely cut off from outside air. To keep those inside from suffocating, human
engineers use giant machines to bring in fresh air and pump stale air out. Termite mounds have the same problem. The largest are more than 10 meters high. On a human scale, that’s like a skyscraper
three and a half kilometers tall! Only instead of condos and offices, it holds
one big farm. The termites collect wood, which grows fungus,
that the termites eat. All that fungus and the millions of termites
that tend to it create a ton of CO2, which would suffocate the colony *and* their crops
if it builds up. To keep the air fresh, the whole mound acts
like a big lung. During the day, the sun heats the outer chambers
more rapidly than the core, moving air up the outside and down the middle. During the night, this current reverses as
the outer chambers lose heat to the cool night air. The whole time, CO2 and oxygen are exchanged
through tiny holes in the outer walls. What’s amazing is this is all constructed
without a boss. No central architect designing the structure. Just instinct and cooperation lets termites
build huge ventilation engines powered by nothing but daily temperature cycles. Leafcutter ants farm fungus on massive scales
too. One colony in South America covered nearly
50 square meters and was home to over 8 million ants! But unlike those towering termites, the ant
labyrinth reached 8 meters underground. So how do they ventilate their agricultural
city? Before we answer that, I want you to try something. Take a piece of paper, hold it under your
lips, and let the other end curl down. If you blow only across the top of the paper,
what do you think will happen? The force of the air hitting the paper should
push it down, right? Well watch this. Here’s what’s happening: Air is a fluid. When I force air across the top of the paper,
that stream pulls other air along, due to viscosity, which is like the friction of
fluids. This leaves an area of low pressure behind, and the paper is pulled up to fill
it. This is called the Coandă effect. What does that have to do with ants? Check this out. When a breeze flows over a hill, the air is
deflected over the top. This pulls air along too, just like when I blew over the paper, drawing air out of the ant hill along the
way. The ants build lower entrances nearby, where
air is drawn in to replace it, ventilating the whole colony with a little breeze. Prairie dogs get the same effect from their
mounds. Breezes over taller hills draw air through
the connected tunnel system, keeping the whole town breathing fresh. There’s even a tiny shrimp that uses this
same system to keep fresh water flowing through its burrows. Persian and Egyptian architects have used
similar structures to cool buildings for centuries, but tiny animals beat us to that technology
by millions of years Nature is full of species that build their
environment to suit them, countless expert animal architects. Sometimes, all you need to solve the most
complex engineering problems is the awesome power of evolution, …and that’s a breath of fresh air. Stay curious. Thanks to edX, our non-profit partner for

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is unique about the way termites construct their mounds to maintain fresh air?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about ants, not termites. A closer match is not found among the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would choose:

**Question 4: What is the Coandă effect, and how does it relate to ant colonies?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the natural daily phenomenon used by ants to regulate the temperature of their anthill, it does mention ants and the Coandă effect, which is related to the ventilation of ant colonies.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4**

However, please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
you our motivations are unbelievably interesting I mean I find I've been working on this for a few years and I just find the topic still so amazingly engaging and interesting so I want to tell you about that the science is really surprising the science is a little bit freaky okay if we are not as endlessly manipulable and as predictable as you would think there's a whole set of unbelievably interesting studies I want to give you two that call into question this idea that if you reward something you get more of the behavior you want if you punish something you get less of it so let's talk let's go from London to the mean streets of Cambridge Massachusetts in the northeastern part of the United States and let's talk about a study done at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology here's what they did they took a whole group of students and they gave them a set of challenges things like um memorizing strings of digits solving word puzzles other kinds of spacial puzzles even physical tasks like throwing a ball through a hoop okay they gave him these challenges and they said to incentivize their performance they gave them three levels of rewards okay so if you did pretty well you got a small monetary reward if you did medium-well you've got a medium monetary reward and if you did really well if you were one of the top performers you've got a large cash prize okay we've seen this movie before this is essentially a typical motivation scheme within organizations right we reward the very top performers we ignore the low performers and the other folks kind of in the middle okay you get a little bit so what happens they do the test they have these incentives here's what they found out one as long as the tasks involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better their performance okay that makes sense but here's what happens but once the tasks call for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance now this is strange right a larger reward led to poorer performance how can that possibly be now what's interesting about this is that these folks here who did this are all economists at two at MIT one at the University of Chicago one at Carnegie Mellon okay the top tier of the economics profession they're reaching this conclusion that seems contrary to what a lot of us learned in economics which is which is that the higher the reward the better their performance and they're saying that once you get above rudimentary cognitive skill it's the other way around which seems like this kind of the idea that these rewards don't work that way seems vaguely the left-wing and socialist doesn't it it's kind of this kind of weird socialist conspiracy for those of you who have those conspiracy theories I want to point out the so the notoriously left-wing socialist group that financed the research the Federal Reserve Bank so this is the mainstream of the mainstream coming to a conclusion that's quite surprising seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics so this is strange it's strange funny so what do they do they say let's this is this is freaky let's go test it somewhere else maybe that fifty dollars a sixty dollar prize isn't sufficiently motivating for an MIT student right so let's go to a place where fifty dollars is actually more significant relatively all right so we take the experiment we're gonna go to mathura india rural india where $50 $60 whatever the number was is actually significant sum of money so they replicated the experiment in india roughly as follows small rewards the equivalent of two weeks salary i'm sorry small performance low performance two weeks salary medium performance about a month salary high performance about two months salary okay so there's a real good incentives okay so you're gonna get a different result here well what happened though was that the people offered the medium reward did no better than the people offered the small reward but this time around the people offered the top reward they did worst of all higher incentives led to worse performance what's interesting about this is that it actually isn't all that anomalous this has been replicated over and over and over again by psychologists by some extent by sociologists and by economists over and over and over again for simple straightforward tasks those kinds of incentives if you do this then you get that they're great for the task that our algorithmic set of rules where you have to just follow along and get a right answer if then rewards carrots and sticks outstanding but when the task gets more complicated when it requires some conceptual creative thinking those kinds of motivators demonstrably don't work fact money is a motivator at work but in a slightly strange way if you don't pay people enough they won't be motivated what's curious about there's another paradox here which is that the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table pay people enough so that they're not thinking about money and they're thinking about the work now once you do that it turns out there are three factors that the science shows lead to the better performance not to mention personal satisfaction autonomy mastery and purpose autonomy is our desire to be self-directed to direct our own lives now in many ways traditional notions of management run afoul of that management is great if you want compliance but if you want engagement which is what we want in the workforce today as people are doing more complicated sophisticated things self-direction is better let me give you some examples of this almost radical forms of self direction in the workplace that lead to good results let's start with this company right here Atlassian an Australian company it's a software company and they do something really cool once a quarter on a Thursday afternoon they say to their developers for the next 24 hours you can work on anything you want you can work on it the way you want you can work on it with whomever you want all we ask is that you show the results to the company at the end of those 24 hours and this fun kind of meeting not a Star Chamber session but this fun meeting with beer and cake and fun and other things like that it turns out that that one day of pure undiluted autonomy has led to a whole array of fixes for existing software a whole array of ideas for new products that otherwise had never emerged one day now this is not an if-then incentive this is not the sort of thing that I would have done three years ago before I knew this research I would have said you want people to be creative and innovative give them a freaking innovation bonus if you could do something cool I'll give you $2,500 they're not doing this at all they're essentially saying you probably want to do something interesting let me just get out of your way one day of autonomy produces things that had never emerged let's talk about mastery masteries are urged to get better at stuff we like to get better at stuff this is why people play musical instruments on the weekend you got all these people who are acting in ways at sea irrational economically they play musical instruments on weekends why it's not gonna get them a mate it's not gonna make them any money why are they doing it cuz it's fun cuz you get better at it and that's satisfying go back in time a little bit imagine I imagine this if I went to my first economics professor a woman named Mary Alice Shulman and I went to her in 1983 and said professor Shulman can I talk to you after class for a moment yeah just I got this inkling I got this idea for a business model I just want to run it past you here's how it would work you get a bunch of people around the world who are doing highly-skilled work but they're willing to do it for free and volunteer their time 20 sometimes 30 hours a week okay she's looking at you somewhat skeptically there oh but but I'm not done and then what they create they give it away rather than sell it it's gonna be huge I mean she would have she truly would have thought I was insane okay it seemed to fly in the face of so many things but what do you have you have Linux powering one out of four corporate servers and fortune 500 companies Apache powering more than the majority of web servers Wikipedia what's going on why are why are people doing this why are they why are these people many of whom are technically sophisticated highly skilled people who have jobs okay they have jobs they're working at jobs for pay doing challenging doing sophisticated technical technological work and yet during their limited discretionary time they do equally if not more technically sophisticated work not for their employer but for someone else for free that's a strange economic behavior economists would look into it why are they doing this it's overwhelmingly clear challenge and mastery along with making a contribution that's it what you see more and more is a rise of what you might call the purpose motive is that more and more organizations want to have some kind of transcendent purpose partly because it makes coming to work better partly because that's the way to get better talent and what we're saying now is in some ways when the profit motive becomes unmoored from the purpose motive bad things happen bad things ethically sometimes but also bad thing just like not good stuff like crappy products like lame services like uninspiring places to work that when the profit motive is is is paramount or when it becomes completely unhitch from the purpose motive it's just people don't do great thing more and more organizations are realizing this and sort of disturbing the categories between what's profit and what's and what's purpose and and I think that that actually heralds something interesting and I think that the companies that organizations that are flourishing whether they're profit for profit are somewhere in between are animated by this purpose motor let me give you a couple of examples here's the founder of Skype he says our goal is to be disruptive but in the cause of making the world a better place pretty good purpose here's Steve Jobs I want to put a ding in the universe all right that's the kind of thing that might get you up in the morning racing to go to work so I think that um that we our purpose maximizers not only profit maximizers I think the science shows that we care about mastery very very deeply and the science shows that we want to be self-directed and I think that the big takeaway here is that if we start treating people like people and not assuming that they're simply horses you know slower smaller better smelling horses if we get past this kind of ideology of carrots and sticks and look at the science I think we can actually build organizations and work lives that make us better off but I also think they have the promise to make our world just a little bit better you

our own lives now in many ways traditional notions of management run afoul of that management is great if you want compliance but if you want engagement which is what we want in the workforce today as people are doing more complicated sophisticated things self-direction is better let me give you some examples of this almost radical forms of self direction in the workplace that lead to good results let's start with this company right here Atlassian an Australian company it's a software company and they do something really cool once a quarter on a Thursday afternoon they say to their developers for the next 24 hours you can work on anything you want you can work on it the way you want you can work on it with whomever you want all we ask is that you show the results to the company at the end of those 24 hours and this fun kind of meeting not a Star Chamber session but this fun meeting with beer and cake and fun and other things like that it turns out that that one day of pure undiluted autonomy has led to a whole array of fixes for existing software a whole array of ideas for new products that otherwise had never emerged one day now this is not an if-then incentive this is not the sort of thing that I would have done three years ago before I knew this research I would have said you want people to be creative and innovative give them a freaking innovation bonus if you could do something cool I'll give you $2,500 they're not doing this at all they're essentially saying you probably want to do something interesting let me just get out of your way one day of autonomy produces things that had never emerged let's talk about mastery masteries are urged to get better at stuff we like to get better at stuff this is why people play musical instruments on the weekend you got all these people who are acting in ways at sea irrational economically they play musical instruments on weekends why it's not gonna get them a mate it's not gonna make them any money why are they doing it cuz it's fun cuz you get better at it and that's satisfying go back in time a little bit imagine I imagine this if I went to my first economics professor a woman named Mary Alice Shulman and I went to her in 1983 and said professor Shulman can I talk to you after class for a moment yeah just I got this inkling I got this idea for a business model I just want to run it past you here's how it would work you get a bunch of people around the world who are doing highly-skilled work but they're willing to do it for free and volunteer their time 20 sometimes 30 hours a week okay she's looking at you somewhat skeptically there oh but but I'm not done and then what they create they give it away rather than sell it it's gonna be huge I mean she would have she truly would have thought I was insane okay it seemed to fly in the face of so many things but what do you have you have Linux powering one out of four corporate servers and fortune 500 companies Apache powering more than the majority of web servers Wikipedia what's going on why are why are people doing this why are they why are these people many of whom are technically sophisticated highly skilled people who have jobs okay they have jobs they're working at jobs for pay doing challenging doing sophisticated technical technological work and yet during their limited discretionary time they do equally if not more technically sophisticated work not for their employer but for someone else for free that's a strange economic behavior economists would look into it why are they doing this it's overwhelmingly clear challenge and mastery along with making a contribution that's it what you see more and more is a rise of what you might call the purpose motive is that more and more organizations want to have some kind of transcendent purpose partly because it makes coming to work better partly because that's the way to get better talent and what we're saying now is in some ways when the profit motive becomes unmoored from the purpose motive bad things happen bad things ethically sometimes but also bad thing just like not good stuff like crappy products like lame services like uninspiring places to work that when the profit motive is is is paramount or when it becomes completely unhitch from the purpose motive it's just people don't do great thing more and more organizations are realizing this and sort of disturbing the categories between what's profit and what's and what's purpose and and I think that that actually heralds something interesting and I think that the companies that organizations that are flourishing whether they're profit for profit are somewhere in between are animated by this purpose motor let me give you a couple of examples here's the founder of Skype he says our goal is to be disruptive but in the cause of making the world a better place pretty good purpose here's Steve Jobs I want to put a ding in the universe all right that's the kind of thing that might get you up in the morning racing to go to work so I think that um that we our purpose maximizers not only profit maximizers I think the science shows that we care about mastery very very deeply and the science shows that we want to be self-directed and I think that the big takeaway here is that if we start treating people like people and not assuming that they're simply horses you know slower smaller better smelling horses if we get past this kind of ideology of carrots and sticks and look at the science I think we can actually build organizations and work lives that make us better off but I also think

**Transcript**:
you our motivations are unbelievably interesting I mean I find I've been working on this for a few years and I just find the topic still so amazingly engaging and interesting so I want to tell you about that the science is really surprising the science is a little bit freaky okay if we are not as endlessly manipulable and as predictable as you would think there's a whole set of unbelievably interesting studies I want to give you two that call into question this idea that if you reward something you get more of the behavior you want if you punish something you get less of it so let's talk let's go from London to the mean streets of Cambridge Massachusetts in the northeastern part of the United States and let's talk about a study done at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology here's what they did they took a whole group of students and they gave them a set of challenges things like um memorizing strings of digits solving word puzzles other kinds of spacial puzzles even physical tasks like throwing a ball through a hoop okay they gave him these challenges and they said to incentivize their performance they gave them three levels of rewards okay so if you did pretty well you got a small monetary reward if you did medium-well you've got a medium monetary reward and if you did really well if you were one of the top performers you've got a large cash prize okay we've seen this movie before this is essentially a typical motivation scheme within organizations right we reward the very top performers we ignore the low performers and the other folks kind of in the middle okay you get a little bit so what happens they do the test they have these incentives here's what they found out one as long as the tasks involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better their performance okay that makes sense but here's what happens but once the tasks call for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance now this is strange right a larger reward led to poorer performance how can that possibly be now what's interesting about this is that these folks here who did this are all economists at two at MIT one at the University of Chicago one at Carnegie Mellon okay the top tier of the economics profession they're reaching this conclusion that seems contrary to what a lot of us learned in economics which is which is that the higher the reward the better their performance and they're saying that once you get above rudimentary cognitive skill it's the other way around which seems like this kind of the idea that these rewards don't work that way seems vaguely the left-wing and socialist doesn't it it's kind of this kind of weird socialist conspiracy for those of you who have those conspiracy theories I want to point out the so the notoriously left-wing socialist group that financed the research the Federal Reserve Bank so this is the mainstream of the mainstream coming to a conclusion that's quite surprising seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics so this is strange it's strange funny so what do they do they say let's this is this is freaky let's go test it somewhere else maybe that fifty dollars a sixty dollar prize isn't sufficiently motivating for an MIT student right so let's go to a place where fifty dollars is actually more significant relatively all right so we take the experiment we're gonna go to mathura india rural india where $50 $60 whatever the number was is actually significant sum of money so they replicated the experiment in india roughly as follows small rewards the equivalent of two weeks salary i'm sorry small performance low performance two weeks salary medium performance about a month salary high performance about two months salary okay so there's a real good incentives okay so you're gonna get a different result here well what happened though was that the people offered the medium reward did no better than the people offered the small reward but this time around the people offered the top reward they did worst of all higher incentives led to worse performance what's interesting about this is that it actually isn't all that anomalous this has been replicated over and over and over again by psychologists by some extent by sociologists and by economists over and over and over again for simple straightforward tasks those kinds of incentives if you do this then you get that they're great for the task that our algorithmic set of rules where you have to just follow along and get a right answer if then rewards carrots and sticks outstanding but when the task gets more complicated when it requires some conceptual creative thinking those kinds of motivators demonstrably don't work fact money is a motivator at work but in a slightly strange way if you don't pay people enough they won't be motivated what's curious about there's another paradox here which is that the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table pay people enough so that they're not thinking about money and they're thinking about the work now once you do that it turns out there are three factors that the science shows lead to the better performance not to mention personal satisfaction autonomy mastery and purpose autonomy is our desire to be self-directed to direct our own lives now in many ways traditional notions of management run afoul of that management is great if you want compliance but if you want engagement which is what we want in the workforce today as

**Transcript**:
"1980." The 80s were all about 
big hair, neon, MTV. And then there was this: "Every October a hole appears in the 
ozone layer over the south pole." "...hole in the ozone shield is the size
of the continental United States." "The protective ozone layer is 
being threatened as never before." "We are all at risk." Scientists warned that humanity was on track
to completely destroy the ozone layer by 2050. Without it ecosystems would collapse, skin cancer rates would skyrocket, and life as we knew it would cease to exist. But today, the ozone layer is healing. In an unprecedented act, the world came together
to prevent an environmental catastrophe. So how did we do it? And what can we learn from it? The ozone layer is a sort of “belt” around
the Earth made up of gaseous molecules. It protects every living thing by absorbing two types of 
ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It’s a powerful shield, but 
it’s also fragile. In 1985, scientists discovered a 
massive loss of ozone here:  right over Antarctica. 40% of the layer had dissipated,
creating a “hole”. Scientists realized the hole formed in the
spring and every year it got worse. This was a wake up call. It wasn't small and far in the future. It was now and way bigger 
than anybody ever imagined. That’s Dr. Solomon, an atmospheric chemist. In 1986, she flew to Antarctica, 
along with other scientists to investigate the cause of the ozone hole. “Leading the team is Susan Solomon, a young atmospheric chemist 
from Boulder, Colorado." You know once you step off the plane in Antarctica, if you've never been there before, your main goal is to get out 
without getting frostbite. "Do you want to do the next one?" But what really our goal was to take measurements, not just of ozone, but also of different chemicals
that would help to show why it was going away. Some scientists released balloons in the sky
to take ozone measurements. While others took measurements on the ground. And they all came to the same conclusion. The biggest problem was chlorine from a man-made
compound called Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On the ground CFCs aren’t harmful. But once they float up to the stratosphere
the Sun breaks them down into chlorine. They bind with ozone to make 
oxygen and chlorine monoxide. Then the loose oxygen atoms 
bump the chlorine atom out, freeing it to destroy more ozone molecules. And that causes a chain reaction. The long lifetime of the chlorofluorocarbons
is a big part of the problem. They live anywhere between 50 and 150 years
in our atmosphere so... It means that every year that you use what you use the year before 
is almost entirely still there. So it just builds up and builds up exponentially. And back then we used a lot of CFCs. The US had already moved away 
from CFCs in aerosol cans. But most of the world hadn’t yet. And they were still in everything from refrigerators
and air conditioners and styrofoam. The entire world needed to make a big change
quickly or we’d face-- Catastrophe. Catastrophe. Unmitigated catastrophe. In 1987, ozone levels had dropped 
by 50 percent. This growing threat led to some of the fastest
collective action on climate we've ever seen. So I like to think of it as, there's three
P's that when, they’re met we do very well at addressing environmental problems. So it was personal. It was perceptible and the solutions 
were practical. If you've been sunburned, you know that 
skin cancer is not a good thing. So everybody understands skin cancer. The personal nature of the threat is huge. The perceptible was easy to do 
with satellite measurements. You can just watch it get 
completely destroyed and go to zero where there should have been a lot of ozone. And we have practical solutions. It was easy to find substitutes for 
chlorofluorocarbons in spray cans that took, you know, less than a year to do. It was a very straightforward switch, And I think the main unifying factor 
in all of that is the public. Scientists like Dr. Solomon held 
press conferences to inform the public. "I think we will eventually see large scale
depletions of the ozone layer in other latitudes." The ozone hole started showing up 
in TV shows and movies. “It’s those damn fluorocarbons, they’ve
been kicking the hell out of the ozone.” “Macaroni, it will burn off.” “Well so will the ozone, eventually.” And all this public awareness put pressure
on leaders around the world to act. “We are here today because we recognize
that urgent action is necessary.” And the Montreal Protocol made it official. It recognized “that world-wide emissions
can significantly deplete the ozone layer and result in adverse effects on human health
and the environment." It listed control measures to reduce ozone
depleting substances in a series of steps. Including help for developing countries who need alternative technology 
and substituting products. Every single country eventually 
signed the protocol. Making it the only universal treaty 
to ever be ratified. And the most successful environmental agreement
in human history. Soon after, the world’s largest CFC producer
began to phase them out. Since the protocol went into effect 
on January 1st, 1989 the consumption of ozone-depleting substances  including CFCs, plummeted. Today, more than thirty years after 
the Montreal Protocol was signed the ozone hole has stopped growing 
and is now shrinking. And by 2065 it is expected to 
have recovered completely. But there’s more to be done. After the CFC ban we began using 
Hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs don’t deplete the ozone layer but they
are a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. And it’s the fastest growing one. So in 2016, the Montreal Protocol 
was amended to include HFCs and now they are being phased out too. But they are only one part 
of a larger issue. "Climate change is already happening, 
right here, right now." "Experts say that we have until 2030 
to avoid catastrophe." "People are suffering." "People are dying." "Entire ecosystems are collapsing." "Unprecedented and even irreversible changes
are happening to this planet." "It is beyond any doubt that 
human activity is to blame." Climate change, our most challenging environmental
problem is still in need of big solutions. So I think people in most parts 
of the world, now understand and are concerned about, 
the personal impact. They found it to be perceptible. And we are finding practical solutions. It's not true that we can't do it anymore. We need to keep our eye on the ball 
on climate change. And if we do we will get the environment 
that we demand.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the year by which scientists warned that humanity was on track to completely destroy the ozone layer. The closest generated MCQ that relates to this topic is Question 5, which asks about the expected outcome for the ozone hole by 2065.

Although Question 5 does not directly ask about the year by which the ozone layer was expected to be destroyed, it does provide information about the expected recovery of the ozone hole, which is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would suggest that Question 5 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
"1980." The 80s were all about 
big hair, neon, MTV. And then there was this: "Every October a hole appears in the 
ozone layer over the south pole." "...hole in the ozone shield is the size
of the continental United States." "The protective ozone layer is 
being threatened as never before." "We are all at risk." Scientists warned that humanity was on track
to completely destroy the ozone layer by 2050. Without it ecosystems would collapse, skin cancer rates would skyrocket, and life as we knew it would cease to exist. But today, the ozone layer is healing. In an unprecedented act, the world came together
to prevent an environmental catastrophe. So how did we do it? And what can we learn from it? The ozone layer is a sort of “belt” around
the Earth made up of gaseous molecules. It protects every living thing by absorbing two types of 
ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It’s a powerful shield, but 
it’s also fragile. In 1985, scientists discovered a 
massive loss of ozone here:  right over Antarctica. 40% of the layer had dissipated,
creating a “hole”. Scientists realized the hole formed in the
spring and every year it got worse. This was a wake up call. It wasn't small and far in the future. It was now and way bigger 
than anybody ever imagined. That’s Dr. Solomon, an atmospheric chemist. In 1986, she flew to Antarctica, 
along with other scientists to investigate the cause of the ozone hole. “Leading the team is Susan Solomon, a young atmospheric chemist 
from Boulder, Colorado." You know once you step off the plane in Antarctica, if you've never been there before, your main goal is to get out 
without getting frostbite. "Do you want to do the next one?" But what really our goal was to take measurements, not just of ozone, but also of different chemicals
that would help to show why it was going away. Some scientists released balloons in the sky
to take ozone measurements. While others took measurements on the ground. And they all came to the same conclusion. The biggest problem was chlorine from a man-made
compound called Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On the ground CFCs aren’t harmful. But once they float up to the stratosphere
the Sun breaks them down into chlorine. They bind with ozone to make 
oxygen and chlorine monoxide. Then the loose oxygen atoms 
bump the chlorine atom out, freeing it to destroy more ozone molecules. And that causes a chain reaction. The long lifetime of the chlorofluorocarbons
is a big part of the problem. They live anywhere between 50 and 150 years
in our atmosphere so... It means that every year that you use what you use the year before 
is almost entirely still there. So it just builds up and builds up exponentially. And back then we used a lot of CFCs. The US had already moved away 
from CFCs in aerosol cans. But most of the world hadn’t yet. And they were still in everything from refrigerators
and air conditioners and styrofoam. The entire world needed to make a big change
quickly or we’d face-- Catastrophe. Catastrophe. Unmitigated catastrophe. In 1987, ozone levels had dropped 
by 50 percent. This growing threat led to some of the fastest
collective action on climate we've ever seen. So I like to think of it as, there's three
P's that when, they’re met we do very well at addressing environmental problems. So it was personal. It was perceptible and the solutions 
were practical. If you've been sunburned, you know that 
skin cancer is not a good thing. So everybody understands skin cancer. The personal nature of the threat is huge. The perceptible was easy to do 
with satellite measurements. You can just watch it get 
completely destroyed and go to zero where there should have been a lot of ozone. And we have practical solutions. It was easy to find substitutes for 
chlorofluorocarbons in spray cans that took, you know, less than a year to do. It was a very straightforward switch, And I think the main unifying factor 
in all of that is the public. Scientists like Dr. Solomon held 
press conferences to inform the public. "I think we will eventually see large scale
depletions of the ozone layer in other latitudes." The ozone hole started showing up 
in TV shows and movies. “It’s those damn fluorocarbons, they’ve
been kicking the hell out of the ozone.” “Macaroni, it will burn off.” “Well so will the ozone, eventually.” And all this public awareness put pressure
on leaders around the world to act. “We are here today because we recognize
that urgent action is necessary.” And the Montreal Protocol made it official. It recognized “that world-wide emissions
can significantly deplete the ozone layer and result in adverse effects on human health
and the environment." It listed control measures to reduce ozone
depleting substances in a series of steps. Including help for developing countries who need alternative technology 
and substituting products. Every single country eventually 
signed the protocol. Making it the only universal treaty 
to ever be ratified. And the most successful environmental agreement
in human history. Soon after, the world’s largest CFC producer
began to phase them out. Since the protocol went into effect 
on January 1st, 1989 the consumption of ozone-depleting substances  including CFCs, plummeted. Today, more than thirty years after 
the Montreal Protocol was signed the ozone hole has stopped growing 
and is now shrinking. And by 2065 it is expected to 
have recovered completely. But there’s more to be done. After the CFC ban we began using 
Hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs don’t deplete the ozone layer but they
are a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. And it’s the fastest growing one. So in 2016, the Montreal Protocol 
was amended to include HFCs and now they are being phased out too. But they are only one part 
of a larger issue. "Climate change is already happening, 
right here, right now." "Experts say that we have until 2030 
to avoid catastrophe." "People are suffering." "People are dying." "Entire ecosystems are collapsing." "Unprecedented and even irreversible changes
are happening to this planet." "It is beyond any doubt that 
human activity is to blame." Climate change, our most challenging environmental
problem is still in need of big solutions. So I think people in most parts 
of the world, now understand and are concerned about, 
the personal impact. They found it to be perceptible. And we are finding practical solutions. It's not true that we can't do it anymore. We need to keep our eye on the ball 
on climate change. And if we do we will get the environment 
that we demand.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 7 has some relevance to the topic of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). However, it does not specifically ask about the lifetime of CFCs in the atmosphere.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic, I would say:

 Question 7: What is the relationship between CFCs and the ozone layer?

However, I must emphasize that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not include a question that specifically asks about the lifetime of CFCs in the atmosphere.

**Transcript**:
February is home to one of the most important
holidays of the year not to forget: Groundhog Day. If you live outside of Can-merica then you
might not know what a groundhog is so... here you go: this is a groundhog. They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who
dig burrows underground. Burrows large enough, in fact, to occasionally
make their comfy home a structural hazard to your comfy home. This explains the first half of their name. The second half is because they're kind of
fat -- though unlike their fellow Can-mericans -- when winter arrives they need their excess
weight to go into hibernation. The story of the holiday is that on February
2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation to peek out of their burrow and look at the
world. If they see their shadow they go back inside
which predicts six more weeks of winter. If they don't, then spring will come early. The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania
Dutch custom of weather prediction and today is celebrated in Canada and 49 of the fifty
states, the exception being Alaska which in 2009 decided to forgo groundhog day in favor
of marmot day. Outside of Alaska, many groundhogs contend
with each other to be the King of Seasonal Weather prediction their their main weapon
in this war being their delightful names such as: Queen Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North
Carolina, Shubenacadie Sam of Nova Scotia Staten Island Chuck from New York French Creek Freddie in West Virginia And... Gus from Athens Georgia though this last groundhog
is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor, General Beauregard Lee, who one must assume
has stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation home while drinking
Mint Julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again. 1,000 miles north of the General, Wiarton
Willie is the groundhog king of Canada, who throws an annual party to help him stay on
top and make sure that people keep building epic statues of him. But, if there could be only one, Punxsutawney
Phil would be him. Not only is his name the most fun to say but
he also has quite a posse of top-hatted, tuxedoed men who look after him and call themselves
the inner circle. According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been
making predictions since the 1880s. Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this
Punxsutawney Phil who is functionally immortal because of a magic life-extending elixir the
inner circle members prepare for him so that he can continue to make predictions -- and
bring in tourist revenue -- until the end of time. He also speaks a language called groundhogese
that only the president of the inner circle can understand. If you think that Groundhog day is a dumb,
pointless holiday then, there are two things you should consider: 1st: you have no sense of fun and 2nd, you
better be careful on Groundhog day, because in addition to their weather predicting day
jobs, these groundhogs also have the magical power to trap you in a infinite time loop
until you learn to be less of a jerk. Happy Groundhog Day�

With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider
info on AsapSCIENCE and behind the scenes, check it out with the link in the description! Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter. We also finally got a PO Box, for all of you
amazing science lovers who have requested to send us mail or other stuff over the years.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What is the effect of increased multi-tasking online on the brain's ability to filter out interferences?

However, an even more similar question is Question 9: How does the constant switching between tasks online affect people's ability to commit information to memory?

But the most similar question is actually Question 2's companion question which would be "What is the effect of increased multi-tasking online on the ability to multi-task effectively?" However, this question is not present, but we have a question related to the effect of increased multi-tasking online on a related aspect which is "the brain's ability to filter out interferences" and another question related to "the ability to commit information to memory". 

However, if I had to choose one from the existing questions, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it directly assesses the impact of frequent task-switching (an aspect of multi-tasking) on cognitive performance.

**Transcript**:
With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider
info on AsapSCIENCE and behind the scenes, check it out with the link in the description! Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter. We also finally got a PO Box, for all of you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 1 does not directly address the information in the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an explanation for my choice.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of the population that uses social media sites, and the correct answer is that the statement "Social media sites are used by 3/4 of the population of the entire world" is false. According to the transcript, social media sites are used by 1/3 of the entire world.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the only one that deals with a percentage related to social media use, although it's about the percentage of internet users who are unable to control the amount of time they spend online.

Considering that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that accurately reflects the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

Index: 1 (with reservations)

With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider
info on AsapSCIENCE and behind the scenes, check it out with the link in the description! Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter. We also finally got a PO Box, for all of you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 1 does not directly address the information in the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an explanation for my choice.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of the population that uses social media sites, and the correct answer is that the statement "Social media sites are used by 3/4 of the population of the entire world" is false. According to the transcript, social media sites are used by 1/3 of the entire world.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the only one that deals with a percentage related to social media use, although it's about the percentage of internet users who are unable to control the amount of time they spend online.

Considering that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that accurately reflects the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider
info on AsapSCIENCE and behind the scenes, check it out with the link in the description! Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter. We also finally got a PO Box, for all of you
amazing science lovers who have requested to send us mail or other stuff over the years.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What is the effect of increased multi-tasking online on the brain's ability to filter out interferences?

However, an even more similar question is Question 9: How does the constant switching between tasks online affect people's ability to commit information to memory?

But the most similar question is actually Question 2's companion question which would be "What is the effect of increased multi-tasking online on the ability to multi-task effectively?" However, this question is not present, but we have a question related to the effect of increased multi-tasking online on a related aspect which is "the brain's ability to filter out interferences" and another question related to "the ability to commit information to memory". 

However, if I had to choose one from the existing questions, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it directly assesses the impact of frequent task-switching (an aspect of multi-tasking) on cognitive performance.

**Transcript**:
[Music] so you've heard of a little something called global climate change and how it's causing the sea level to rise and chances are you've been told or imagined ice caps and Glaciers like those that cover most of Greenland and Antarctica melting away because of increased temperatures and adding their water to the Sea and while this does happen it's only half of the story the truth is a major contributor to increasing sea levels comes from something called thermal expansion thermal expansion is the tendency for matter to change its volume in response to temperature we've all experienced this when boiling water over the stove as the water heats up the particles begin to move more vigorously and in effect actually increase the volume of the water this can also be seen with a thermometer as the fluid inside heats up it increases in volume and makes its way up the tube so what happens when 1.4 billion cubic km of water gets heated across the globe the exact same thing the particles move more and begin to take up more space causing the ocean's volume to increase and thus rise the same amount of water taking up more space got a burning question you want answered ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter and subscribe for more weekly science [Music] videos

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 has some similarities. However, it does not ask about the amount of water on Earth.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the amount of water, but such a question does not exist among the generated MCQs. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, I would choose:

 Question 4 does not match but a non existing question with the content of question 4 and the quantification of the ground truth MCQ would be the most similar, however since this does not exist the most similar is:

[MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: Thanks to Curiosity
Stream for supporting PBS Digital Studios.  So stay like this, and
then lift up like this. Use this momentum to kick
your legs up even if you don't go all the way yet. And like bend your legs,
and see if you can go to just the top of your head.  Just kidding. Hey. I'm Diana. You're watching "Physics Girl." And last week, I got to
hang out with contortionist and YouTuber, Sophie Dossi. We did some science
experiments for her channel. And while we were hanging out,
I realized that, as a physicist, I know absolutely
nothing about what stretching does to your
body and whether there is a scientifically-supported
way of becoming more flexible. There is. Stay tuned. I didn't know, so I
headed over to USC to meet with a bio mechanist
to find out the latest science.  I'm Michael Rowley. I am a PhD candidate
in the division of biokinesiology
and physical therapy.  My first question
was, is there something different about Sophie?  I'm just going to
get into a back bend, and like lift up my feet.  Oh my gosh.  Yes, yes. Very different. But I mean, like
biomechanically, does she have a superpower?  There's evidence that people
who are hyper flexible--  Quick pause. Hyper flexible or hypermobile
is actually a scientific term. And there is a test used to
determine whether someone is hyper flexible. It's called the
Beighton score, and I'll link to it in the description
if you want to test yourself. OK. So people who are hypermobile--  Those people have a
little bit more relatively of the more stretchy collagen
than the type I collagen.  Uh-huh. I need a quick refresher on
collagen. Take it away Michael.  So a bone to bone
connection is a ligament. And then a muscle to bone
connection is the tendon. Tendons and
ligaments are made up of mostly collagen, which
is a type of protein. And there's different
types of collagen. So tendons and ligaments have
primarily type I collagen, which is a really strong type,
and then also some type III collagen, which will
be more stretchy, and then may also include
some elastin, which is another type of
connective tissue that's very elastic
and stretchy. So the ratios of those
things can be different.  Got it. So Sophie might actually have
a different material makeup of the tissues in
her body, like she might have more of that
type III collagen, which would allow her to do things
that the average person can't do.  Fact was, I almost can't
overstretch anymore because I'm just completely in half. So it's like I have
pushed the limit on that, like there's just-- I mean you can't--
you're not a ghost. You're not a ghost.  But how flexible is Sophie?  Yeah. Before I started
contortion, I was always more flexible than
that average gymnast.  Oh, than even the
average gymnast.  Yes.  Not even the average person.  Yeah. When I was little,
I use to watch TV with my feet over my head.  Yeah. That's flexible. OK. But how do you get
flexible biomechanically? I guess my first question
is, when you stretch, what parts of your body
are stretching out? Yeah.  So when you stretch, you're
going to increase flexibility and excursion in all those
tissues-- muscles, tendons, ligaments. The most short-term, the
fastest, most acute effects will be in the muscle.  So your tendons
and your ligaments are stretching out too? How does that work? They seem so sturdy. This is getting to the heart
of what I really, really want to know, which is, what
is physically happening to all of these tissues?  The actual pieces
of physiology that change with stretching,
the body will change the water content in the material. That's probably the fastest way. And then you can
also induce some stem cells that still live in
the tendon material themselves. And those can differentiate
into more cells. They can produce more
or slightly different types of febrile or
proteins like that collagen that I talked about.  Humph. So your body can change
the material properties of your tissues by stretching? Cool.  Another way is that you
actually modify sensation. So you might experience some
mild pain the first time you're going to stretch,
but you'll actually desensitize yourself to
that pain over repeated stretching multiple days
a week for multiple weeks.  Hold up. Really?  Yeah.  One way of getting
more flexible is just becoming
more numb to pain?  It actually really feels good. It feels like a
nice, good stretch. It doesn't feel like
a hurt stretch at all.  Crazy. I have no chance.  Another change that
happens physiologically with stretching, our muscles have
an alpha-gamma reflex loop. So when you stretch
your muscle, there's this automatic signal that
gets sent to the spinal cord. It doesn't even go up
to the brain and back. The spinal cord then tells
the muscle to contract. That coactivation would be
bad for stretching, right? If you're stretching the
muscle, and then the muscle's trying to pull back on you. So over time, you can actually
down regulate that reflex loop, and that's been shown to
happen when you stretch for long periods of time. Lastly, you actually add
length to the muscle fibers. And you do that by
adding sarcomeres, which are sort of
the contractile unit producing the active
contraction of muscles.  Wow. Bodies are so complicated. So let's recap. Stretching can change the
water content in your muscles, stem cell differentiation,
how much you feel pain, that alpha-gamma reflex
loop from your muscles to your spinal cord, and the
length of your muscle fibers. That's cool. Now I know what's going on
when you get more flexible. Biomechanics is cool, almost
as awesome as physics-- maybe more useful though-- which
brings me to my last question. What does science have to say
about how to get more flexible? Well, Michael pointed me
to this really interesting meta-analysis, which is like
a big study that actually synthesizes all the
findings from other studies, in this case, 23
other studies, which looked at how to get the best
benefits on improved range of motion, or flexibility. And they found that
static stretching, that is when you
ease into a stretch and then hold it for 30
to 60 seconds, that's the best for improved range
of motion, or flexibility. And as far as how
much to stretch, they found that
five minutes total per week of one muscle group
was sort of the lower limit. But you didn't see much more
of a benefit over 10 minutes a week of stretching. And six days out of the week was
the plateau of seeing returns. So the more you
stretch per day doesn't keep increasing the
benefits, but that frequency, six days a week and
then the five minutes total for that week,
is what's important. So commence operation
stretching muscle group for six days a week,
five minutes total. Now, of course, different
types of stretching have different
benefits, so I will link to some of the other
literature in the description. But more importantly
in the description is the video that I did over
with Sophie on her channel. I channeled my inner YouTuber,
and we did a challenge where all the science
experiments I was doing, Sophie had to do with her feet. She's insane. It was amazing. I had so much fun filming with
her, so check out that video and subscribe to

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. However, the options provided in Question 9 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be Question 2, but it also does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a possible match based on the content and intent of the questions.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the false statement regarding collagen. Question 2 is the closest match, as it asks about the type of collagen primarily found in tendons and ligaments. However, it does not ask about a false statement.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but it is not an exact match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This is because both the ground truth MCQ and Question 4 deal with the event of Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, delivering an order that declared all slaves to be free. Although the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about who led the Union soldiers, and Question 4 asks about the significance of the order, they both refer to the same event and share similar content and intent.

However, a more precise match in terms of question intent would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about who led the Union soldiers. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

But if we had to choose the closest match, it would be Question 4, with the understanding that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent.

**Transcript**:
"We are hurtling toward the day when climate
change could be irreversible." "Rising sea levels already altering this nation’s
coast." "China’s capital is choking in its worst
pollution of the year." "5% of species will become extinct." "Sea levels rising, glaciers melting." Okay. Enough. I get it. It’s not like I don’t care about polar
bears and melting ice caps. I’m a conservation scientist, so of course
I care. I’ve dedicated my entire career to this. But over the years, one thing has become clear
to me: We need to change the way we talk about climate change. This doom-and-gloom messaging just isn’t
working; we seem to want to tune it out. And this fear, this guilt, we know from psychology
is not conducive to engagement. It's rather the opposite. It makes people passive, because when I feel
fearful or guilt-full, I will withdraw from the issue and try to think about something
else that makes me feel better. And with a problem this overwhelming, it’s
pretty easy to just turn away and kick the can down the road. Somebody else can deal with it. So it’s no wonder that scientists and policymakers
have been struggling with this issue too. So I like to say that climate change is the
policy problem from hell. You almost couldn't design a worse problem
as a fit with our underlying psychology or the way our institutions make decisions. Many Americans continue to think of climate
change as a distant problem: distant in time, that the impacts won't be felt for a generation
or more; and distant in space, that this is about polar bears or maybe some developing
countries. Again, it’s not like we don’t care about
these things — it’s just such a complicated problem. But the thing is, we’ve faced enormous,
scary climate issues before. Remember the hole in the ozone layer? As insurmountable as that seemed in the 1970s
and ’80s, we were able to wrap our heads around that and take action. People got this very simple, easy to understand,
concrete image of this protective layer around the Earth, kind of like a roof, protecting
us, in this case, from ultraviolet light, which by the way has the direct health consequence
of potentially giving you skin cancer. Okay, so now you've got my attention. And so then they came up with this fabulous
term, the “ozone hole.” Terrible problem, great term. People also got a concrete image of how we
even ended up with this problem. For decades, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
were the main ingredient in a lot of products, like aerosol spray cans. Then scientists discovered that CFCs were
actually destroying the atmospheric ozone. People could look at their own hairspray and
say, “Do I want to destroy the planet because of my hairspray? I mean, god no.” And so what's interesting is that sales of
hairspray and those kinds of products and underarm aerosols started dropping quite dramatically. People listened to scientists and took action. Now scientists predict that the hole in the
ozone layer will be healed around 2050. That’s actually pretty amazing. And while stopping the use of one product
is actually pretty easy, climate change caused by greenhouse gases … that’s much trickier. Because the sources are more complicated,
and for the most part, they’re totally invisible. Right now, there is CO2 pouring out of tailpipes,
there is CO2 pouring out of buildings, there is CO2 pouring out of smokestacks, but
you can't see it. The fundamental cause of this problem is largely
invisible to most of us. I mean, if CO2 was black, we would have dealt
with this issue a long time ago. So CO2 touches every part of our lives — our
cars, the places we work, the food we eat. For now, let’s just focus on one thing:
our energy use. How do we make that visible? That was the initial goal of UCLA’s Engage
project, one of the nation’s largest behavioral experiments in energy conservation. What we're trying to do is to figure out how
to frame information about electricity usage so that people save energy and conserve electricity. The idea is that electricity is relatively
invisible to people. The research team outfitted part of a student
housing complex with meters that tracked real-time usage of appliances and then sent them weekly
reports. So you can see how much energy the stove used
versus the dishwasher or the fridge. We realized, because of this project, the
fridge was like the monster. So lucky for them, their landlord upgraded
their fridge to an energy-efficient one. They also learned other energy-saving tips,
like unplugging their dishwasher when not in use and air-drying their clothes during
the summer months. And researchers, in turn, discovered where
people were willing to cut back. The Engage project wanted to know what types
of messaging could motivate people to change their behavior. We wanted to see over time over a year and
with repeated messages, how do people, behave? How does that impact the consumer behavior? And what we found is that it's very different. Some households were sent personalized emails
with their energy bill about how they could save money; others learned how their energy
usage impacted the environment and children’s health. Those who received messages about saving money
did nothing. It was totally ineffective because electricity
is relatively cheap. But emails sent that linked the amount of
pollutants produced to rates of childhood asthma and cancer — well, those led to an
8% drop in energy use, and 19% in households with kids. Now, in a separate study, researchers brought
social competition into the mix. First, they hung posters around a dorm building
to publicly showcase how students were really doing: red dots for energy wasters, green
for those doing a good job, and a shiny gold star for those going above and beyond. This social pressure approach led to a 20%
reduction in energy use. This strategy was also used at Paulina’s
complex, and it definitely brought out her competitive streak. For me, the competition was what motivated
me, because seeing your apartment number and telling you that you are doing at the average,
but you are not the best, was like, Why? I’m doing everything you are telling me
to do. I always wanted the gold star, because it
was like, “Oh, my god, I want to be like the less consumption of energy in the whole
building.” And psychology studies have proved this. We are social creatures, and as individualistic
as we can be, turns out we do care about how we compare to others. And yes, we do like to be the best. Some people don’t want to say, Oh, I'm like
the average. No, my usage is different and I want to be
able to act on it. And people can act on it because with these
meters, they can now see their exact impact. A company called Opower is playing with this
idea of social competition. They work with over 100 utility companies
to provide personalized energy reports to millions of customers around the world. Now consumers can not only see their energy
use but how it compares to their neighbors’. Like the UCLA study found, this subtle social
pressure encourages consumers to save energy. It’s been so effective that in 2016, Opower
was able to generate the equivalent of two terawatt-hours of electricity savings. That’s enough to power every home in Miami
for more than a year. And they’re not alone. Even large companies are tapping into behavioral
science to move the dial. Virgin Atlantic Airways gave a select group
of pilots feedback on their fuel use. Over the course of a year, they collectively
saved over 6,800 tons of fuel by making some simple changes:
Adjusting their altitudes, routes, and speed reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by
over 21,000 tons. These behavioral “nudges” do seem to be
advancing how we as a society deal with some pretty complicated climate change issues,
but it turns out we’re just getting started. There is no “quick fix.” We need people changing their companies, changing
their business models, changing the products and services they provide. This is about broader-scale change. And part of this change includes embracing
what makes us human. That it can’t just be a guilt trip about
dying polar bears or driving around in gas guzzlers. We need to talk about our wins, as well — like
how we’re making progress, really being aware of our energy use, and taking advantage
of that competitive spirit we all have in order to really move us from a state of apathy
to action. Global warming is by far the biggest issue
of our time. Climate Lab is a new series from Vox and the
University of California, and we’ll be exploring some surprising ways we can tackle this problem. If you want to learn more, head to climate.universityofcalifornia.edu.

**Transcript**:
"We are hurtling toward the day when climate
change could be irreversible." "Rising sea levels already altering this nation’s
coast." "China’s capital is choking in its worst
pollution of the year." "5% of species will become extinct." "Sea levels rising, glaciers melting." Okay. Enough. I get it. It’s not like I don’t care about polar
bears and melting ice caps. I’m a conservation scientist, so of course
I care. I’ve dedicated my entire career to this. But over the years, one thing has become clear
to me: We need to change the way we talk about climate change. This doom-and-gloom messaging just isn’t
working; we seem to want to tune it out. And this fear, this guilt, we know from psychology
is not conducive to engagement. It's rather the opposite. It makes people passive, because when I feel
fearful or guilt-full, I will withdraw from the issue and try to think about something
else that makes me feel better. And with a problem this overwhelming, it’s
pretty easy to just turn away and kick the can down the road. Somebody else can deal with it. So it’s no wonder that scientists and policymakers
have been struggling with this issue too. So I like to say that climate change is the
policy problem from hell. You almost couldn't design a worse problem
as a fit with our underlying psychology or the way our institutions make decisions. Many Americans continue to think of climate
change as a distant problem: distant in time, that the impacts won't be felt for a generation
or more; and distant in space, that this is about polar bears or maybe some developing
countries. Again, it’s not like we don’t care about
these things — it’s just such a complicated problem. But the thing is, we’ve faced enormous,
scary climate issues before. Remember the hole in the ozone layer? As insurmountable as that seemed in the 1970s
and ’80s, we were able to wrap our heads around that and take action. People got this very simple, easy to understand,
concrete image of this protective layer around the Earth, kind of like a roof, protecting
us, in this case, from ultraviolet light, which by the way has the direct health consequence
of potentially giving you skin cancer. Okay, so now you've got my attention. And so then they came up with this fabulous
term, the “ozone hole.” Terrible problem, great term. People also got a concrete image of how we
even ended up with this problem. For decades, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
were the main ingredient in a lot of products, like aerosol spray cans. Then scientists discovered that CFCs were
actually destroying the atmospheric ozone. People could look at their own hairspray and
say, “Do I want to destroy the planet because of my hairspray? I mean, god no.” And so what's interesting is that sales of
hairspray and those kinds of products and underarm aerosols started dropping quite dramatically. People listened to scientists and took action. Now scientists predict that the hole in the
ozone layer will be healed around 2050. That’s actually pretty amazing. And while stopping the use of one product
is actually pretty easy, climate change caused by greenhouse gases … that’s much trickier. Because the sources are more complicated,
and for the most part, they’re totally invisible. Right now, there is CO2 pouring out of tailpipes,
there is CO2 pouring out of buildings, there is CO2 pouring out of smokestacks, but
you can't see it. The fundamental cause of this problem is largely
invisible to most of us. I mean, if CO2 was black, we would have dealt
with this issue a long time ago. So CO2 touches every part of our lives — our
cars, the places we work, the food we eat. For now, let’s just focus on one thing:
our energy use. How do we make that visible? That was the initial goal of UCLA’s Engage
project, one of the nation’s largest behavioral experiments in energy conservation. What we're trying to do is to figure out how
to frame information about electricity usage so that people save energy and conserve electricity. The idea is that electricity is relatively
invisible to people. The research team outfitted part of a student
housing complex with meters that tracked real-time usage of appliances and then sent them weekly
reports. So you can see how much energy the stove used
versus the dishwasher or the fridge. We realized, because of this project, the
fridge was like the monster. So lucky for them, their landlord upgraded
their fridge to an energy-efficient one. They also learned other energy-saving tips,
like unplugging their dishwasher when not in use and air-drying their clothes during
the summer months. And researchers, in turn, discovered where
people were willing to cut back. The Engage project wanted to know what types
of messaging could motivate people to change their behavior. We wanted to see over time over a year and
with repeated messages, how do people, behave? How does that impact the consumer behavior? And what we found is that it's very different. Some households were sent personalized emails
with their energy bill about how they could save money; others learned how their energy
usage impacted the environment and children’s health. Those who received messages about saving money
did nothing. It was totally ineffective because electricity
is relatively cheap. But emails sent that linked the amount of
pollutants produced to rates of childhood asthma and cancer — well, those led to an
8% drop in energy use, and 19% in households with kids. Now, in a separate study, researchers brought
social competition into the mix. First, they hung posters around a dorm building
to publicly showcase how students were really doing: red dots for energy wasters, green
for those doing a good job, and a shiny gold star for those going above and beyond. This social pressure approach led to a 20%
reduction in energy use. This strategy was also used at Paulina’s
complex, and it definitely brought out her competitive streak. For me, the competition was what motivated
me, because seeing your apartment number and telling you that you are doing at the average,
but you are not the best, was like, Why? I’m doing everything you are telling me
to do. I always wanted the gold star, because it
was like, “Oh, my god, I want to be like the less consumption of energy in the whole
building.” And psychology studies have proved this. We are social creatures, and as individualistic
as we can be, turns out we do care about how we compare to others. And yes, we do like to be the best. Some people don’t want to say, Oh, I'm like
the average. No, my usage is different and I want to be
able to act on it. And people can act on it because with these
meters, they can now see their exact impact. A company called Opower is playing with this
idea of social competition. They work with over 100 utility companies
to provide personalized energy reports to millions of customers around the world. Now consumers can not only see their energy
use but how it compares to their neighbors’. Like the UCLA study found, this subtle social
pressure encourages consumers to save energy. It’s been so effective that in 2016, Opower
was able to generate the equivalent of two terawatt-hours of electricity savings. That’s enough to power every home in Miami
for more than a year. And they’re not alone. Even large companies are tapping into behavioral
science to move the dial. Virgin Atlantic Airways gave a select group
of pilots feedback on their fuel use. Over the course of a year, they collectively
saved over 6,800 tons of fuel by making some simple changes:
Adjusting their altitudes, routes, and speed reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by
over 21,000 tons. These behavioral “nudges” do seem to be
advancing how we as a society deal with some pretty complicated climate change issues,
but it turns out we’re just getting started. There is no “quick fix.” We need people changing their companies, changing
their business models, changing the products and services they provide. This is about broader-scale change. And part of this change includes embracing
what makes us human. That it can’t just be a guilt trip about
dying polar bears or driving around in gas guzzlers. We need to talk about our wins, as well — like
how we’re making progress, really being aware of our energy use, and taking advantage
of that competitive spirit we all have in order to really move us from a state of apathy
to action. Global warming is by far the biggest issue
of our time. Climate Lab is a new series from Vox and the
University of California, and we’ll be exploring some surprising ways we can tackle this problem. If you want to learn more, head to climate.universityofcalifornia.edu.

**Transcript**:
When it comes to buying stuff, I’ve often
wondered how did I live without online shopping? I mean literally today anything I want is
available to me 24/7. I can buy anything anytime. In fact 79% of Americans shop online. This happens when they’re laying in bed,
while they’re out with friends having a drink. It turns out actually one in five us shop
online while we’re using the bathroom. All this stuff we’re buying magically appears
on our doorstep. But what effect does all this shopping have
on the planet? Delivery services ship a lot more packages
now because of online shopping. Since 2009 US Postal Service deliveries increased
by 65%. And during the holidays, UPS deliveries have
increased by 260 million packages since 2010. Now for the most part, if you compare online
shopping with driving to the store, online shopping has a smaller carbon footprint. But there’s a catch. It's only better for the environment if you
don't get rushed delivery. Most of us, including me, are choosing faster
delivery like two day shipping because most of the time it's free. Why wouldn’t we want it right away? But it isn’t just a time difference, it’s
an environmental difference. All these faster deliveries mean more trucks
on the road and that’s causing more greenhouse gases. And that means more global warming. When we choose two-day shipping, deliveries
often come in multiple packages. Let’s say I buy some dish soap and a pair
of socks. The shipping warehouse near me might be out
of dish soap, so they fly some in from another state. Meanwhile, those socks, they’re getting
sent to me on a separate truck. Also, the company is trying to get it to me
quickly, so trucks are often sent out only half full -- If there was more flexibility
in timing, they could fill them up all the way. If you know you have five-day delivery window,
you can wait from all the products to come in from different sources, consolidate the
shipment, and send it. And now you can wait for many customers’
orders to come in and consolidate that into, let’s say, a full truckload. This is Miguel Jaller. He studies sustainable transportation at the
University of California, Davis. By picking the longer delivery window, I’m
giving the company more time to find the most efficient way to get a product to me. Another problem is with returns. So one of the things that companies made is
offering this reliable and fast and almost free return option. So now as a customer, I can actually try the
product, even if I don’t have any store to go to, because if I don’t like it or
it doesn’t fit, I can actually return it at no cost. So like with buying clothes, if I shop online
and pick the ‘try before you buy’ option, it would be like saying a delivery truck is
driving back and forth just to find me the right stuff. So what are companies trying to do? When you think of the future of online shipping,
you might imagine drones and driverless cars. But today’s solutions are more about keeping
traffic moving along, like with wifi traffic lights that let truckers know ahead of time
when the light will turn red. This cuts down on idling at the light and
wasting fuel. We’re now starting to transmit the timing
of those traffic lights, in anticipation for that, they might want to speed up a little
bit or slow down or do these certain little velocity changes so that they increase their
chances of getting through that light. This is Matt Barth at the University of California,
Riverside. He’s looking at ways trucks can reduce their
transit footprint. You can essentially smooth out your patterns
of travel. And when you smooth out your travel patterns,
you get those fuel-economy benefits. Cities like San Jose and Las Vegas are already
testing out this traffic light technology. You can save 15 to 20 percent fuel just by
doing those type of activities. And on the highway, trucks are now starting
to talk to each other -- it’s called truck platooning. You can think of it like cruise control except
its transmitting the truck’s speed to the other vehicles following behind. This lets all the trucks drive in unison at
the same speed close behind each other. What they’re doing is trying to reduce the
drag. The narrow gaps they create between each other
shields the trucks that are following from wind resistance. And so there’s been a number of experiments
worldwide that have shown, you know, you can get 10 to 15, 20 percent energy savings, fuel
savings by doing that type of platooning. Now delivery companies have been tackling
fuel use and emissions for decades. Take UPS. Since the 1970s they’ve encouraged drivers
to eliminate left hand turns, reducing their emissions by 100,000 metric tons. That’s like taking 21,000 cars off the road. So there are ways companies can shrink their
carbon footprint, but what if they were better about changing customer behavior – like
getting us to be conscious about how we shop online? I’ve always picked that 2 day option because
to be honest never really thought about it, but what if companies offered a green option? So if you just check a box they would just
ship stuff to you in the most energy efficient way possible. Sure, maybe it takes a little bit longer,
but that’s something I’d actually be willing to do. I mean every now and again, I might need something
right away. But I probably don’t need to overnight a
delivery of socks to my front door. You probably do a lot of your online shopping
with your smartphone. Well watch our other episode to see what kind
of impact these devices have on our planet.

**Transcript**:
When it comes to buying stuff, I’ve often
wondered how did I live without online shopping? I mean literally today anything I want is
available to me 24/7. I can buy anything anytime. In fact 79% of Americans shop online. This happens when they’re laying in bed,
while they’re out with friends having a drink. It turns out actually one in five us shop
online while we’re using the bathroom. All this stuff we’re buying magically appears
on our doorstep. But what effect does all this shopping have
on the planet? Delivery services ship a lot more packages
now because of online shopping. Since 2009 US Postal Service deliveries increased
by 65%. And during the holidays, UPS deliveries have
increased by 260 million packages since 2010. Now for the most part, if you compare online
shopping with driving to the store, online shopping has a smaller carbon footprint. But there’s a catch. It's only better for the environment if you
don't get rushed delivery. Most of us, including me, are choosing faster
delivery like two day shipping because most of the time it's free. Why wouldn’t we want it right away? But it isn’t just a time difference, it’s
an environmental difference. All these faster deliveries mean more trucks
on the road and that’s causing more greenhouse gases. And that means more global warming. When we choose two-day shipping, deliveries
often come in multiple packages. Let’s say I buy some dish soap and a pair
of socks. The shipping warehouse near me might be out
of dish soap, so they fly some in from another state. Meanwhile, those socks, they’re getting
sent to me on a separate truck. Also, the company is trying to get it to me
quickly, so trucks are often sent out only half full -- If there was more flexibility
in timing, they could fill them up all the way. If you know you have five-day delivery window,
you can wait from all the products to come in from different sources, consolidate the
shipment, and send it. And now you can wait for many customers’
orders to come in and consolidate that into, let’s say, a full truckload. This is Miguel Jaller. He studies sustainable transportation at the
University of California, Davis. By picking the longer delivery window, I’m
giving the company more time to find the most efficient way to get a product to me. Another problem is with returns. So one of the things that companies made is
offering this reliable and fast and almost free return option. So now as a customer, I can actually try the
product, even if I don’t have any store to go to, because if I don’t like it or
it doesn’t fit, I can actually return it at no cost. So like with buying clothes, if I shop online
and pick the ‘try before you buy’ option, it would be like saying a delivery truck is
driving back and forth just to find me the right stuff. So what are companies trying to do? When you think of the future of online shipping,
you might imagine drones and driverless cars. But today’s solutions are more about keeping
traffic moving along, like with wifi traffic lights that let truckers know ahead of time
when the light will turn red. This cuts down on idling at the light and
wasting fuel. We’re now starting to transmit the timing
of those traffic lights, in anticipation for that, they might want to speed up a little
bit or slow down or do these certain little velocity changes so that they increase their
chances of getting through that light. This is Matt Barth at the University of California,
Riverside. He’s looking at ways trucks can reduce their
transit footprint. You can essentially smooth out your patterns
of travel. And when you smooth out your travel patterns,
you get those fuel-economy benefits. Cities like San Jose and Las Vegas are already
testing out this traffic light technology. You can save 15 to 20 percent fuel just by
doing those type of activities. And on the highway, trucks are now starting
to talk to each other -- it’s called truck platooning. You can think of it like cruise control except
its transmitting the truck’s speed to the other vehicles following behind. This lets all the trucks drive in unison at
the same speed close behind each other. What they’re doing is trying to reduce the
drag. The narrow gaps they create between each other
shields the trucks that are following from wind resistance. And so there’s been a number of experiments
worldwide that have shown, you know, you can get 10 to 15, 20 percent energy savings, fuel
savings by doing that type of platooning. Now delivery companies have been tackling
fuel use and emissions for decades. Take UPS. Since the 1970s they’ve encouraged drivers
to eliminate left hand turns, reducing their emissions by 100,000 metric tons. That’s like taking 21,000 cars off the road. So there are ways companies can shrink their
carbon footprint, but what if they were better about changing customer behavior – like
getting us to be conscious about how we shop online? I’ve always picked that 2 day option because
to be honest never really thought about it, but what if companies offered a green option? So if you just check a box they would just
ship stuff to you in the most energy efficient way possible. Sure, maybe it takes a little bit longer,
but that’s something I’d actually be willing to do. I mean every now and again, I might need something
right away. But I probably don’t need to overnight a
delivery of socks to my front door. You probably do a lot of your online shopping
with your smartphone. Well watch our other episode to see what kind
of impact these devices have on our planet.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options, it is the closest match in terms of question intent. Question 4 asks about the purpose of the glucose produced by the liver, which is related to the process described in the ground truth MCQ. The correct option for Question 4, "To create a homemade antifreeze that prevents cell dehydration," is also related to the correct sequence of events described in the ground truth MCQ (option C: b, a, d, c).

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. The ground truth MCQ asks about the sequence of events that occurs after the ice sucks the water out of the frog's cells, whereas the generated MCQs ask about specific aspects of the wood frog's physiology or behavior. 

Therefore, while Question 4 is the closest match, it's not a perfect match, and a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ would be needed to accurately assess the same knowledge.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What would happen to the wood frog's cells if they lost more than 60% of their water? 

However, the closest match in terms of question intent is Question 4: What is the purpose of the glucose produced by the liver in the wood frog's body? 

But the closest match overall is Question 5's content and Question 4's intent is found in Question 4's description in the transcript: "the antifreeze prevents too much water being drawn out of the cells by the ice outside if they lose more than 60% of their water the process becomes irreversible the cells will crumple and die from frostbite"

However, another generated MCQ is even more similar to the ground truth MCQ: 
Question 3: What happens to the water in the frog's blood when the first ice crystals form on its skin? 

The correct answer for Question 3 is: A. It freezes and causes the frog's cells to dehydrate

This is very similar to the ground truth MCQ's correct answer: The antifreeze prevents too much water being taken out of the wood frog's cells

But the most similar generated MCQ is actually not among the given options as it is not a direct match, however among the given options the most similar generated MCQ is:

 Question 4: What is the purpose of the glucose produced by the liver in the wood frog's body?

Because the purpose of the glucose is to prevent the cells from dehydrating which is the same intent as the ground truth MCQ.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 4

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options, it is the closest match in terms of question intent. Question 4 asks about the purpose of the glucose produced by the liver, which is related to the process described in the ground truth MCQ. The correct option for Question 4, "To create a homemade antifreeze that prevents cell dehydration," is also related to the correct sequence of events described in the ground truth MCQ (option C: b, a, d, c).

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. The ground truth MCQ asks about the sequence of events that occurs after the ice sucks the water out of the frog's cells, whereas the generated MCQs ask about specific aspects of the wood frog's physiology or behavior. 

Therefore, while Question 4 is the closest match, it's not a perfect match, and a new question that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ would be needed to accurately assess the same knowledge.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What would happen to the wood frog's cells if they lost more than 60% of their water? 

However, the closest match in terms of question intent is Question 4: What is the purpose of the glucose produced by the liver in the wood frog's body? 

But the closest match overall is Question 5's content and Question 4's intent is found in Question 4's description in the transcript: "the antifreeze prevents too much water being drawn out of the cells by the ice outside if they lose more than 60% of their water the process becomes irreversible the cells will crumple and die from frostbite"

However, another generated MCQ is even more similar to the ground truth MCQ: 
Question 3: What happens to the water in the frog's blood when the first ice crystals form on its skin? 

The correct answer for Question 3 is: A. It freezes and causes the frog's cells to dehydrate

This is very similar to the ground truth MCQ's correct answer: The antifreeze prevents too much water being taken out of the wood frog's cells

But the most similar generated MCQ is actually not among the given options as it is not a direct match, however among the given options the most similar generated MCQ is:

 Question 4: What is the purpose of the glucose produced by the liver in the wood frog's body?

Because the purpose of the glucose is to prevent the cells from dehydrating which is the same intent as the ground truth MCQ.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 4

we squeezed a the spear of the nation called us Caesar was formed after Sharpeville when 67 people were killed men women and children and over 180 were wounded during a peaceful demonstration it is at that time that Mandela realized and it was a very difficult decision for him that nonviolent resistance was not enough since he was wanted by the government he traveled abroad secretly gaining support for the cause when he returned to South Africa he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison while in prison he was also charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government Mandela stood trial but refused to defend himself because this would legitimize the state's case Mandela received a life sentence to be served in the prison on Robben Island a desolate Rock Island seven miles off the coast of Cape Town instead of being forgotten in jail Mandela became a symbol for the movement to end apartheid during the 1980s several offers of release were made to Mandela on the condition that he renounce violence he refused in February of 1990 the government declared the ANC legal and announced Mandela was to be released here's this man who hasn't been seen for over a quarter century walking out into the world now free at the age of 71 Mandela was named the head of the ANC his work to help bring an end to apartheid earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 in 1994 for the first time in more than 300 years blacks in South Africa would have the opportunity to vote for their rulers at the age of 75 Mandela was elected president in a landslide becoming the president I think he really really moved the world because this was a place that most of us didn't think would ever see black leadership and so for him to rise to power after being in jail for 27 years I think it was just a really historical moment Mandela proved to be a master politician knowing when to be unyielding and when to compromise unfortunately his marriage to Winnie came to an end in 1996 in 1998 Mandela married his third wife on his 80th birthday the following year he stepped down as president of the ANC Nelson used his stature to help mediate the civil war in Burundi he continues to work with human rights organizations and for AIDS awareness and I think that he will be known as you know one of the peaceful freedom fighters of our time Nelson Mandela continues to be a defining symbol of how one man can truly make a difference in the world

we squeezed a the spear of the nation called us Caesar was formed after Sharpeville when 67 people were killed men women and children and over 180 were wounded during a peaceful demonstration it is at that time that Mandela realized and it was a very difficult decision for him that nonviolent resistance was not enough since he was wanted by the government he traveled abroad secretly gaining support for the cause when he returned to South Africa he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison while in prison he was also charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government Mandela stood trial but refused to defend himself because this would legitimize the state's case Mandela received a life sentence to be served in the prison on Robben Island a desolate Rock Island seven miles off the coast of Cape Town instead of being forgotten in jail Mandela became a symbol for the movement to end apartheid during the 1980s several offers of release were made to Mandela on the condition that he renounce violence he refused in February of 1990 the government declared the ANC legal and announced Mandela was to be released here's this man who hasn't been seen for over a quarter century walking out into the world now free at the age of 71 Mandela was named the head of the ANC his work to help bring an end to apartheid earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 in 1994 for the first time in more than 300 years blacks in South Africa would have the opportunity to vote for their rulers at the age of 75 Mandela was elected president in a landslide becoming the president I think he really really moved the world because this was a place that most of us didn't think would ever see black leadership and so for him to rise to power after being in jail for 27 years I think it was just a really historical moment Mandela proved to be a master politician knowing when to be unyielding and when to compromise unfortunately his marriage to Winnie came to an end in 1996 in 1998 Mandela married his third wife on his 80th birthday the following year he stepped down as president of the ANC Nelson used his stature to help mediate the civil war in Burundi he continues to work with human rights organizations and for AIDS awareness and I think that he will be known as you know one of the peaceful freedom fighters of our time Nelson Mandela continues to be a defining symbol of how one man can truly make a difference in the world

**Transcript**:
[coughing sounds]
This is how COVID-19 is spread. Through air currents, potentially carrying
microscopic droplets full of coronavirus. When we talk. Breathe. Or cough. We can see this thanks to an imaging technique
that lets us peer into the invisible world of airflow. And using this same technique, we can see
if masks really do help to stop the spread of coronavirus [MUSIC] Hey smart people, Joe here. If you’ve been feeling confused about masks,
what they do, what they don’t do, and whether or not you should wear one – I hope this
video will help. And since I’m all by myself at the moment,
I don’t need to wear this. Or this. This is Matthew Staymates, a fluid dynamicist
and mechanical engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And while stuck at home he turned his garage
into a lab. Using a technique called schlieren imaging
he captured some incredible images of a world invisible to our eyes. If you’ve ever seen wavering distortions
above a hot road, that fluttery mirage happens because different temperatures and densities
of air bend light in different ways, like a fluid lens. And when we talk, warm air streams out of
our mouths meeting the sea of colder air around us. A schlieren setup lets us see these tiny differences. A narrow source of light is bounced off a
concave mirror towards a camera, with a thin metal blade blocking some of the focused light. As that light interacts with air in the space
between, it’s bent in ever-so-slightly different ways, creating shadows and bright spots in
the final image. As you can see in this Veritasium video from
my friend Derek, it lets us see everything from shockwaves to heat rising off a candle. And at 250 frames per second, it shows us
exactly why masks work to slow airborne infection. Now, it’s important to remember that we
can’t see viral particles in these images. They are too small. But the viruses are carried on that breath
just like a river carries fish. In fact, an individual viral particle is smaller
than the weave of most fabrics. So why does this work? Well, masks help in two interesting ways. First, it’s important to understand that
viruses don’t float around alone. They fly out in droplets of moisture. Most droplets are heavy enough that they fall
within 2 meters or so, but any person or object within that distance can get bathed in virus. And without a mask, some of those droplets
can evaporate into super tiny particles of infection that can float on air currents far
from your mouth or nose, and these microdroplets are extremely hard for any mask to filter
out. But with a mask on, in the warm, humid space
between your mouth and the mask, those larger droplets don’t have time to evaporate, and
they can be captured by common fabrics. If it feels hot and humid in here, that means
it’s working. And the second way masks work, is that any
droplets that do get through now have less momentum. The air currents disperse in eddies and swirls
instead of flowing away in streams, which means droplets won’t travel as far. So, which mask is the best mask? If it seems like recommendations change all
the time, that’s because doctors and scientists know more now than they did months ago. And they will know more months from now, than
they do today. Which is exactly how science is supposed to
work. What we do know is whether you’re using
a bandana, an N95 mask, or a cloth mask you sewed at home, they all still have a lot of
droplet-blocking power. But that mask has to fit. This is almost like not wearing a mask at
all. A mask that’s too tight, or has too many
thick layers can actually force more air out the sides. A good test is to see if you can blow a candle
out through your mask from about 1 foot away. [blowing] These schlieren images are clear evidence
that masks are effective. But the best science relies on multiple lines
of evidence. Here's an experiment that we did with a person
talking through a sheet of laser light, illuminating all of the microdroplets released as we speak. With a mask, those droplets are all caught. And this microbiologist sneezed, sang, talked,
and coughed over petri dishes. A simple mask blocked nearly all of the germs,
and even though this experiment detected bacteria and not viruses, they both leave our airway
in the same respiratory droplets. It should be pretty clear to you now why masks
work, and the body of research that proves that is getting stronger all the time. Links down in the description! But really, the most important question is
why should you wear a mask? You know, it’s often said that masks aren’t
to keep you from getting sick, but to keep you from getting others sick. Wearing a mask can dramatically reduce the
chance of spreading COVID. But that’s a strange thing to think about,
because you might think “Well, I’m not sick, I’ve got a strong immune system…
so I don’t need to wear this.” But we know that COVID-19 can go undetected,
and almost half of infections may come from people who don’t show symptoms. That could be you. Or it could be the person next to you. And if it is, wouldn’t you want them wearing
a mask? They probably feel the same way about you. Can masks harm your health, like lowering
your body’s oxygen levels? No, that’s a myth, and it’s been tested
over and over again by healthcare workers who work all day in masks. And masks won't stop the pandemic on their
own. They’re best used in combination with other
safety measures, like handwashing and physical distancing. Stereotypically "macho" people have actually
been shown to resist masks more. I get it: Dudes, you don’t feel cool, even
though lots of cool dudes wear masks. Or maybe your nose itches, and your glasses
fog up, your face is sweaty. No fun. I get it. For most people wearing masks is new, and
weird, and different. But there are lots of things that used to
be weird and different, until everyone just started doing them. I mean umbrellas used to be viewed as completely
feminine accessories for rich people, and only to shade the sun. Until one day some masculine men decided they
were tired of getting rained on and suddenly enough people were using umbrellas that they
became like the most boring, socially acceptable thing ever. It's true, look it up. Most people didn’t use condoms in sexual
relationships until the risks of HIV and other infections pushed people to change their behavior,
and now it’s not only normal, it’s a way to say I respect you, and I want to protect
both of us. This is also a sign you want to protect others
and have them protect you. And the sooner that this becomes part of everyone’s
normal, everyday life, the sooner we can all get back to normal, everyday life. In every pandemic in history, it’s the actions
and choices of individual people that have made the difference. A mask can stop a virus, but it also sends
a message: We’re all in this together. And that’s something we all need to hear
right now and every day. Stay curious. Thanks for watching this video and I hope
that you'll send it to somebody that you know that needs to hear this message. But remember, what we know from social psychology
is that shaming people into wearing masks, that's not going to work. SO come at it with an open mind and an open
heart, and we can all do this together. And like always, I'd like to thank everyone
who supports the show on Patreon. We couldn't do it without you, this video

**Transcript**:
Have you ever had someone try to explain something
to you a dozen times with no luck – but, then, when you see a picture, the idea finally
clicks? If that sounds familiar, maybe you might consider
yourself a visual learner. Or, if reading or listening does the trick,
maybe you feel like you’re a verbal learner. We call these labels learning styles, but
is there /really/ a way to categorize different types of students? Well, it actually seems like /multiple/ presentation
formats, especially if one of them is visual, help most people learn. When psychologists and educators test for
learning styles, they’re trying to figure out whether these are inherent traits that
affect how well students learn, instead of just a preference. Usually, they start by giving a survey to
figure out what style a student favors, like visual or verbal learning. Then, they try to teach the students something
with a specific presentation style, like using visual aids, and do a follow-up test to see
how much they learned. That way, the researchers can see if the self-identified
verbal learners really learned better when the information was just spoken aloud, for
example. But, according to a 2008 review, only /one/
study that followed this design found that students actually learned best with their
preferred style… And it had some pretty big flaws. The researchers excluded two-thirds of the
original participants because they didn't seem to have /any/ clear learning style from
the survey at the beginning. Plus, they removed outliers from the data
if they thought they were “extreme,” without defining exactly what that meant. And, they didn't even report the actual test
scores in the final paper. So ... it doesn’t really seem like learning
styles are an inherent trait that we all have. But, that doesn't mean that all students will
do amazingly if they just spend all their time reading from a textbook. Instead, /most people/ seem to learn better
if they’re taught in several ways – especially if one is visual. In one study, researchers tested whether students
remembered lists of words better if they heard them, saw them, or both. And everyone seemed to do better if they got
to see the words in print, even the self-identified auditory learners. That preference didn't seem to matter. Similar studies tested whether students learned
basic physics and chemistry concepts better by reading plain text or viewing pictures,
too. And everyone did better with the help of pictures. So the question of whether or not you're a
visual learner could best be answered with: "Well, yeah, kinda. But so are most people." Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever had someone try to explain something
to you a dozen times with no luck – but, then, when you see a picture, the idea finally
clicks? If that sounds familiar, maybe you might consider
yourself a visual learner. Or, if reading or listening does the trick,
maybe you feel like you’re a verbal learner. We call these labels learning styles, but
is there /really/ a way to categorize different types of students? Well, it actually seems like /multiple/ presentation
formats, especially if one of them is visual, help most people learn. When psychologists and educators test for
learning styles, they’re trying to figure out whether these are inherent traits that
affect how well students learn, instead of just a preference. Usually, they start by giving a survey to
figure out what style a student favors, like visual or verbal learning. Then, they try to teach the students something
with a specific presentation style, like using visual aids, and do a follow-up test to see
how much they learned. That way, the researchers can see if the self-identified
verbal learners really learned better when the information was just spoken aloud, for
example. But, according to a 2008 review, only /one/
study that followed this design found that students actually learned best with their
preferred style… And it had some pretty big flaws. The researchers excluded two-thirds of the
original participants because they didn't seem to have /any/ clear learning style from
the survey at the beginning. Plus, they removed outliers from the data
if they thought they were “extreme,” without defining exactly what that meant. And, they didn't even report the actual test
scores in the final paper. So ... it doesn’t really seem like learning
styles are an inherent trait that we all have. But, that doesn't mean that all students will
do amazingly if they just spend all their time reading from a textbook. Instead, /most people/ seem to learn better
if they’re taught in several ways – especially if one is visual. In one study, researchers tested whether students
remembered lists of words better if they heard them, saw them, or both. And everyone seemed to do better if they got
to see the words in print, even the self-identified auditory learners. That preference didn't seem to matter. Similar studies tested whether students learned
basic physics and chemistry concepts better by reading plain text or viewing pictures,
too. And everyone did better with the help of pictures. So the question of whether or not you're a
visual learner could best be answered with: "Well, yeah, kinda. But so are most people." Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to

**Transcript**:
Whether you're watching an entire Netflix series in one sitting, or playing the newest Zelda from start to finish, most of us spend a significant time in front of screens. But is binge watching bad for your brain and body? In the past, it may have actually been deadly. In 1967, an error in manufacturing led to the selling of TVs which emitted harmful X-Rays with radiation levels 100,000 times higher than what is considered safe today. But even modern televisions cause a strain on your eyes. Under normal circumstances, humans blink around 18 times per minute, but when staring at a screen, this rate decreases drastically causing sore and tired eyes. Fortunately, these symptoms are generally short-term. In children, however, simply spending extended hours indoors can have developmental effects. A condition called Myopia, where the eyes cannot focus properly, is seen much more frequently in children who spend more time inside. Not only are you constantly forced to focus on nearby objects as opposed to far off landscapes and distances, but scientists believe that the sun itself may actually play a role in healthy eye regulation. And while TV may feel like a nice way to relax your body and brain, that may not always be a good thing. Not only is a sedentary lifestyle a major contributor to obesity, but studies have shown that people who watch less TV tend to burn more calories, even if they aren't doing more physical activity. Simply doing more mentally rigorous tasks like reading, playing a board game, or simple household activities, requires more energy and burns more calories. And if you want to truly relax, TV before bed may also be hurting you. Studies have shown that it may actually reduce the hours of quality sleep, contributing to chronic sleep debt. It may also affect other bedtime activities. Researchers have found that those who watch more than 20 hours of TV a week have, on average, a 44% reduction in sperm. But perhaps the most significant findings relate directly to your life span. Not only is there a documented correlation between TV viewing time and risk for diabetes and heart disease, but as shocking as it may be, multiple studies have found a correlation between TV viewing time and ALL causes of death. One study concluded that every hour spent in front of the TV may cut as much as 22 minutes off your life. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, and you can have a healthy relationship with TV if consumed in moderation like anything else. At the root of many of these claims is the physical inactivity associated with prolonged TV watching. Ultimately, the more you move, the more you live.

**Transcript**:
This is Horseshoe Bend. It’s a stunning view of a U-turn in the
Colorado River near the border of Arizona and Utah. In the early 90s, this spot was a hidden gem
— accessible by an unmarked dirt trail off the side of the highway. Locals described it as “nearly empty”
— and that “hardly anybody knew about it.” But over the years, its popularity grew: first
slowly... … and then suddenly. Until it became this. In this past this used to be that this place would get maybe a few thousand visitors every single year. Now, that number is more like 1.5 million. And it keeps growing. That change didn’t happen because of any
big marketing push. It happened because of geotagged pictures
like these. Digital popularity is physically changing
the landscape. This place — and other public lands like
it — are trying to adjust. Social media — I believe — was the
main trigger. That explosion — just — has been overwhelming. You can see that social media explosion when
you look at the rate of Google searches for Horseshoe Bend. But it isn't the only previously-hidden spot
that's become internet famous. Similar increases have happened at Devil’s
Bathtub, a swimming hole in Virginia... … Kanarraville Falls, a waterfall trail
in Utah... … and Vance Creek Bridge, an old railroad
overpass in Washington. So why are these places getting so much attention? For outdoor photographers searching for the
perfect shot, Instagram made things easy: The app’s interface put geotagging — the
practice of attaching location data to a picture — front and center. And if a hidden spot didn’t already have
a location tag available, anyone could create one. These Instagram hotspots were often located
either just outside protected lands, or far off the beaten path. So as America’s National Parks became more
popular than ever, these places started getting National
Park-level crowds without having National Park-level infrastructure. Federally protected areas require a ton of
planning and work to keep people and the environment safe. There wasn't a developed trail here. There weren't any restroom facilities. There was no railing. It was an undeveloped site. Without that infrastructure, the natural landscape
can be damaged — and people following geotagging trends are at risk of injury or death. At Conundrum Hot Springs in Colorado, visitors
disturbed wildlife, cut down trees for firewood, and left behind an overwhelming amount of
human waste. And at Kaaterskill Falls in New York, at least
four people have died while taking or posing for pictures. So at Horseshoe Bend, trail designers are
getting to work. The park service and the city of Page are
creating over 400 parking spaces, a welcome center, bathrooms, a viewing deck with safety
railings, and laser-equipped signs to count attendance. And they’re building a new ADA-compliant
trail, lined with limestone to protect the surrounding environment and reinforced with
magnesium chloride to keep gravel in place. Throughout the trail, all the improvements
that we're doing are aimed at creating as natural an environment as possible. It's a difficult balance. You're not going to stop people from going
to the rim's edge and trying to capture that iconic photo. We don't want to wall it off. So all we can do is implore that people be safe. For places like Kanarraville Falls in Utah,
that concern for safety extends to their residents, too. The town’s water comes from a spring near
the falls, where’s it’s piped to tanks near the canyon entrance. It used to be a local secret — but in 2016,
40,000 people hiked that trail, disturbing the water source and leaving debris behind. It shares so quick, and it gets out
there so fast, that people can look at it and say “Oh wow, look at that!” Then they tap on the photo, and it’ll tell
where it was from or where it was taken. Things like that, and people go wild over it. You can imagine what that does to
the canyon floor, the trail, the water — people in and out. We've just tried to take adequate measures
to try to work with the ecosystem, and not have it ruin our water source. Others are taking a different approach: there’s
now a growing movement in the nature photography scene against geotagging. So, in 1999 this organization called Leave
No Trace came up with a set of guidelines for people to use while they’re in the outdoors. These are things like don’t leave trash
behind, don’t interfere with wildlife, leave everything as it was when you saw it. And now in 2018 they’ve announced that they’re
encouraging people not to geotag photos while they’re in nature. We’ve always had the tendency to explore
— and sometimes be irresponsible in nature. Modern technology just amplifies those
urges. With so many natural wonders at our fingertips
today, it’s even more urgent that we treat them with respect and care — before it’s
too late. Hi there – thanks for watching The Goods,

**Transcript**:
This is Horseshoe Bend. It’s a stunning view of a U-turn in the
Colorado River near the border of Arizona and Utah. In the early 90s, this spot was a hidden gem
— accessible by an unmarked dirt trail off the side of the highway. Locals described it as “nearly empty”
— and that “hardly anybody knew about it.” But over the years, its popularity grew: first
slowly... … and then suddenly. Until it became this. In this past this used to be that this place would get maybe a few thousand visitors every single year. Now, that number is more like 1.5 million. And it keeps growing. That change didn’t happen because of any
big marketing push. It happened because of geotagged pictures
like these. Digital popularity is physically changing
the landscape. This place — and other public lands like
it — are trying to adjust. Social media — I believe — was the
main trigger. That explosion — just — has been overwhelming. You can see that social media explosion when
you look at the rate of Google searches for Horseshoe Bend. But it isn't the only previously-hidden spot
that's become internet famous. Similar increases have happened at Devil’s
Bathtub, a swimming hole in Virginia... … Kanarraville Falls, a waterfall trail
in Utah... … and Vance Creek Bridge, an old railroad
overpass in Washington. So why are these places getting so much attention? For outdoor photographers searching for the
perfect shot, Instagram made things easy: The app’s interface put geotagging — the
practice of attaching location data to a picture — front and center. And if a hidden spot didn’t already have
a location tag available, anyone could create one. These Instagram hotspots were often located
either just outside protected lands, or far off the beaten path. So as America’s National Parks became more
popular than ever, these places started getting National
Park-level crowds without having National Park-level infrastructure. Federally protected areas require a ton of
planning and work to keep people and the environment safe. There wasn't a developed trail here. There weren't any restroom facilities. There was no railing. It was an undeveloped site. Without that infrastructure, the natural landscape
can be damaged — and people following geotagging trends are at risk of injury or death. At Conundrum Hot Springs in Colorado, visitors
disturbed wildlife, cut down trees for firewood, and left behind an overwhelming amount of
human waste. And at Kaaterskill Falls in New York, at least
four people have died while taking or posing for pictures. So at Horseshoe Bend, trail designers are
getting to work. The park service and the city of Page are
creating over 400 parking spaces, a welcome center, bathrooms, a viewing deck with safety
railings, and laser-equipped signs to count attendance. And they’re building a new ADA-compliant
trail, lined with limestone to protect the surrounding environment and reinforced with
magnesium chloride to keep gravel in place. Throughout the trail, all the improvements
that we're doing are aimed at creating as natural an environment as possible. It's a difficult balance. You're not going to stop people from going
to the rim's edge and trying to capture that iconic photo. We don't want to wall it off. So all we can do is implore that people be safe. For places like Kanarraville Falls in Utah,
that concern for safety extends to their residents, too. The town’s water comes from a spring near
the falls, where’s it’s piped to tanks near the canyon entrance. It used to be a local secret — but in 2016,
40,000 people hiked that trail, disturbing the water source and leaving debris behind. It shares so quick, and it gets out
there so fast, that people can look at it and say “Oh wow, look at that!” Then they tap on the photo, and it’ll tell
where it was from or where it was taken. Things like that, and people go wild over it. You can imagine what that does to
the canyon floor, the trail, the water — people in and out. We've just tried to take adequate measures
to try to work with the ecosystem, and not have it ruin our water source. Others are taking a different approach: there’s
now a growing movement in the nature photography scene against geotagging. So, in 1999 this organization called Leave
No Trace came up with a set of guidelines for people to use while they’re in the outdoors. These are things like don’t leave trash
behind, don’t interfere with wildlife, leave everything as it was when you saw it. And now in 2018 they’ve announced that they’re
encouraging people not to geotag photos while they’re in nature. We’ve always had the tendency to explore
— and sometimes be irresponsible in nature. Modern technology just amplifies those
urges. With so many natural wonders at our fingertips
today, it’s even more urgent that we treat them with respect and care — before it’s
too late. Hi there – thanks for watching The Goods,

around a fire when out of nowhere, the smoke blows straight into your face. Naturally, you just get up, 
you move to get out of the way. You go back to having a good time again, and the smoke is suddenly 
blowing right back in your face! It was over there when I was over there! Now I’m over here, it’s over here! You and the people near you, you move out 
of the way, everything’s fine for a bit. Until, once again, your eyes start to sting. Eventually, everyone gets huddled in the one place that seems like it’s been smoke free. But you know what happens next. Your friends say that you are cursed because you brought the 
smoke with you as you moved. There is no curse, which is honestly too bad. Because curses can be broken, 
but laws of physics cannot. So all that smoke starts with fire. And fires release a lot of energy as heat, and air molecules nearby absorb some 
of that heat and start to move faster. Since temperature is just an 
average measurement of how much energy molecules have, that means 
the air starts heating up too. Those speedy molecules collide 
with their slower neighbors and send those neighbors flying 
off in the opposite direction, freeing up space for the hot 
air near the fire to expand. This whole chain of events 
results in the air near the fire becoming less dense than the air around it. Now, you may have heard that 
less-dense air rises, and that is true. It's usually better to live 
on the top floor in the winter and in the basement in the summer. You also may have heard that less-dense air rises because it weighs less than the air it replaces, which is also true, but it's more 
of a definition than an explanation. It just means that less-dense air 
rises because it's less dense. The reason dense stuff sinks is because as you get farther above the ground, there 
is less and less air above you. So air down at the ground has 
to push with a lot of force to support the weight of all the air above it. And it's not just air! Everything down here at the ground pushes 
against the weight of the air above it. Now, if you were light enough that the 
force of gravity on your body pulled you down less than that air pushed you up, 
you would lift off like a hot air balloon. But you’re not: gravity pulls you 
down more than the air pushes you up. So you sink. The hot air around a fire, on the other 
hand, is less dense than the air around it. Gravity pulls it down less than 
the air around it pushes it up, and it rises into the sky. This is called convection. It happens 
in the Sun; it happens in the Earth; it happens in your oven, whether 
or not you have a convection oven. And, most importantly, it happens around a fire. And the real key to understanding why 
smoke keeps blowing in your face is that the rising air doesn’t just rise on its own. It is pushed by the air around it. Because when hot air moves away from 
the fire, the air that pushed it keeps right on going and fills the 
gap that the hot air left behind. And this is where you come in. You might think that you’re just sitting 
by the fire roasting some marshmallows. The fire is affecting you, but 
you’re not affecting the fire. But you are. You form a wall that creates a kind of vacuum. If you were not there, air that 
comes from where you’re sitting and air that comes from across the fire 
would meet up at the fire and stop there. But you are there, so your body blocks the air behind you from moving toward the fire. So there’s nothing to stop the air coming 
toward you from moving right on through the fire and into your face, bringing any 
smoke or soot from the fire along with it. And since it’s you that’s blocking the air, 
you block the air wherever you move to. Even more annoyingly, the 
vacuum is stronger when you have more people in one place because more 
people block more of that airflow. So you’re better off on your own 
than huddled with your friends if you want to avoid getting all 
that smoke in your eyes and lungs. Or you could just get rid of 
the smoke in the first place. Then, the vacuum would just 
send warm air your way. And that’s the idea behind smokeless fire pits. Smoke is mostly compounds in 
wood that didn’t burn completely, either because the fire isn’t hot enough 
or because there isn’t enough oxygen. Smokeless fire pits solve the second 
problem by creating additional paths for incoming air, reducing or even eliminating 
how much smoke a fire produces. If that’s not an option, your next 
best bet is to bring a protractor. And the more protractors, the better the party. That’s what I always say. Without any outside wind, having 
everyone spaced out equally means that the same amount of air 
is blocked from all directions, and nobody’s vacuum is 
stronger than anyone else’s. It’s really like a perfect 
pandemic activity: you’re outside, you’re breathing into a fire 
plus, if you get too close to your friend, you get punished with 
a bunch of smoke in your eyes. And if you’re looking for some

**Transcript**:
[ INTRO ] It’s advice as old as time: if you get a
sunburn, start lathering on the Aloe Vera. And when we say ‘old as time’, we mean
it. Humans have been using aloe vera medicinally
for thousands of years. But does the slimy gel actually have skin-healing
properties? Well, the research is surprisingly scarce,
but it seems like it may help boost your skin’s natural healing process. Sunburns themselves really aren’t all that
different than burns from a campfire, a curling iron, or stepping on a George Foreman grill. So studies looking at burn healing tend to
lump them together. And there is some evidence that applying the
mucus innards from Aloe plants helps you heal faster after a burn. A review from 2007 in the journal Burns found
that in 127 burn victims, those who used aloe healed almost 9 days faster on average than
those in control groups. But what aloe actually does is a little less
clear. In general, there are three main concerns
when treating burns: reducing pain, actually healing the wound, and preventing infection. Aloe’s antibacterial and antifungal activities
are well documented, so it might simply help because it keeps pesky microbes at bay. But ask just about anyone who slathers on
the aloe after a sunburn, and they’ll swear it’s an analgesic, meaning that it reduces
pain. And that might be because it reduces inflammation—your
body’s immune response that makes things like sunburns all red and painful. For example, an experiment in 1993 was able
to isolate an enzyme in aloe that breaks down bradykinin, an inflammatory substance linked
with pain. But there’s not all that much clinical research
on aloe pain-killing effects, so the jury is still out on whether they’re real, or
it’s just acting as a placebo. There’s a bit more evidence that it boosts
skin healing. Studies in rats have shown that aloe extract
helps new skin cells move into burned areas, so they can rebuild the damaged tissue. And the gooey gel in aloe vera contains a
large amount of glucomannan, a fiber comprised mostly of the sugar mannose, which stimulates
the production of fibroblastic growth factor. It helps stimulate the formation of collagen
and new blood vessels, which speed up how quickly the skin heals. That said, human studies to date are kind
of flimsy. A 2012 Cochrane review noted that the few
trials that have been conducted aren’t high quality—they’re all small, and their results
are potentially biased by things the patients or caregivers knowing aloe was being used. So, it might work, or it might just be that
people think it’ll work. And when it comes to your over the counter
sunburn gel, it might not even be the aloe itself. Researchers have found that it can speed up
that absorption of vitamins and drugs through the skin. So if your aloe gel also has things like Vitamin
E, or some other anti-inflammatory drug, that substance gets into your skin faster. But whether aloe works or not, I think we
can all agree it’s just better to avoid needing it. So if you’re going to spend some time in
the sun this summer, maybe take steps to avoid overexposure instead of relying on aloe to
soothe your beet-red skin afterwards. Thanks to Joelle and Brianna Beecher for asking,

**Transcript**:
[SQUEAKING] [POP] Check this out. I'm just gonna drag this plate
through the water in the pool. That's it. But look what forms--
perfect black circles on the bottom of the pool. And it's so weird. They don't die. They just keep going
right next to each other. I sped this footage
up because the circles took 3 minutes to cross
the pool and didn't seem to be dying out. These got sharper as they went
and made it all the way across. So cool. And look closer. You can see what's causing them. There are two almost
unnoticeable dips in the surface of the water. Why don't they die out? And how do these
dark spots form? And why do the
dips move together? So many questions. Let's first look
at what they are. When I dragged the
plate through the water, you could see it
forming little vortices, like you get when you move
a paddle through the water. A vortex is a gas
or a liquid moving in circles with what we
call a vortex line going up through the circles. They are everywhere--
tornadoes, water flowing down the drain, hurricanes,
or the movement of air over an airplane wing. Vortices often form when there's
a difference in fluid speed, like fast wind moving
over slow wind. As you move the plate
forward, the water right next to the boundary
moves with the plate because of friction. The water further
out is not moving. It's that difference in velocity
that causes a shear force and starts the water spinning. This is accentuated by the water
in front of the plate being forced around the
sides and the water behind the plate
being sucked forward as the plate moves along. In this coherent
vortex, our dips can travel much further
across the pool than a ripple without dissipating. Why? The vortex wants to keep
its angular momentum. So it continues spinning as
it moves through the water and only loses some
energy through friction to the surrounding
stationary water. So what we appear to
have here is two vortices moving across the pool. But it seems weird that
they stay right together. Well, when we
create this vortex, we're forcing water to move
around the whole plate, not just on the
surface of the water. Our vortex line is curved. We're creating a
half vortex ring. You know, like a smoke ring,
bubble ring, or even the plume rising up from an
explosion, but half of that. These two dips on
the water's surface are just the ends
of the half ring. They're connected. And that's why
they stay together. We can see this if we put
a little food coloring into the ends. The food coloring travels
from one end to the other. And you can see the
entire half ring. So cool. We just made a bubble
ring without the bubble. This also tells you
something interesting. The half ring is not a wave. A wave is a disturbance
moving through a medium that transfers energy but
doesn't transfer matter. When we added food
coloring, we saw clearly that the vortex is
transferring matter, just like a smoke ring does. So sadly, it's not a wave. It's cooler than a wave. Now back to this
half-ring vortex. Isn't it weird? You've probably never seen
half of a smoke ring before. Why? Well, according to
Helmholtz's law, a vortex line cannot
start or end in a fluid. So a vortex line either
wants to close into a loop or end at a boundary. If you tried to cut
a smoke ring in half, it would either break
up or, even cooler, it would break up into
two smaller smoke rings. I don't know if that happens. It would be awesome. Since the line can't end in the
fluid, it ends at the surface. You almost never see
these half vortices though because
they have to occur on the boundary of two media. If you can think of another
way to make the entire half ring visible, like a smoke ring
or a bubble ring, let me know. So now, why does our vortex
create those cool dark spots? Well, the balance between
gravity, centripetal forces, and surface tension
creates a funnel shape which acts like a lens. Lenses often work by
focusing light to a point, like this Fresnel lens, which
can melt pennies in the sun. But I digress. Our vortex lenses focus the
sunlight away from the center, like so. And you have a bright ring

[SQUEAKING] [POP] Check this out. I'm just gonna drag this plate
through the water in the pool. That's it. But look what forms--
perfect black circles on the bottom of the pool. And it's so weird. They don't die. They just keep going
right next to each other. I sped this footage
up because the circles took 3 minutes to cross
the pool and didn't seem to be dying out. These got sharper as they went
and made it all the way across. So cool. And look closer. You can see what's causing them. There are two almost
unnoticeable dips in the surface of the water. Why don't they die out? And how do these
dark spots form? And why do the
dips move together? So many questions. Let's first look
at what they are. When I dragged the
plate through the water, you could see it
forming little vortices, like you get when you move
a paddle through the water. A vortex is a gas
or a liquid moving in circles with what we
call a vortex line going up through the circles. They are everywhere--
tornadoes, water flowing down the drain, hurricanes,
or the movement of air over an airplane wing. Vortices often form when there's
a difference in fluid speed, like fast wind moving
over slow wind. As you move the plate
forward, the water right next to the boundary
moves with the plate because of friction. The water further
out is not moving. It's that difference in velocity
that causes a shear force and starts the water spinning. This is accentuated by the water
in front of the plate being forced around the
sides and the water behind the plate
being sucked forward as the plate moves along. In this coherent
vortex, our dips can travel much further
across the pool than a ripple without dissipating. Why? The vortex wants to keep
its angular momentum. So it continues spinning as
it moves through the water and only loses some
energy through friction to the surrounding
stationary water. So what we appear to
have here is two vortices moving across the pool. But it seems weird that
they stay right together. Well, when we
create this vortex, we're forcing water to move
around the whole plate, not just on the
surface of the water. Our vortex line is curved. We're creating a
half vortex ring. You know, like a smoke ring,
bubble ring, or even the plume rising up from an
explosion, but half of that. These two dips on
the water's surface are just the ends
of the half ring. They're connected. And that's why
they stay together. We can see this if we put
a little food coloring into the ends. The food coloring travels
from one end to the other. And you can see the
entire half ring. So cool. We just made a bubble
ring without the bubble. This also tells you
something interesting. The half ring is not a wave. A wave is a disturbance
moving through a medium that transfers energy but
doesn't transfer matter. When we added food
coloring, we saw clearly that the vortex is
transferring matter, just like a smoke ring does. So sadly, it's not a wave. It's cooler than a wave. Now back to this
half-ring vortex. Isn't it weird? You've probably never seen
half of a smoke ring before. Why? Well, according to
Helmholtz's law, a vortex line cannot
start or end in a fluid. So a vortex line either
wants to close into a loop or end at a boundary. If you tried to cut
a smoke ring in half, it would either break
up or, even cooler, it would break up into
two smaller smoke rings. I don't know if that happens. It would be awesome. Since the line can't end in the
fluid, it ends at the surface. You almost never see
these half vortices though because
they have to occur on the boundary of two media. If you can think of another
way to make the entire half ring visible, like a smoke ring
or a bubble ring, let me know. So now, why does our vortex
create those cool dark spots? Well, the balance between
gravity, centripetal forces, and surface tension
creates a funnel shape which acts like a lens. Lenses often work by
focusing light to a point, like this Fresnel lens, which
can melt pennies in the sun. But I digress. Our vortex lenses focus the
sunlight away from the center, like so. And you have a bright ring
surrounding a dark circle. The ring highlights the
dark circle further. And you get these incredibly
clear black spots. So cool. Now I highly recommend
trying this at home, especially if it's too
cold to swim in the pool. Here are some tips. The water has to be very still. Even a small breeze makes
it harder to create these. The sun has to be
out, or it won't work. And you can try some
other really cool things. Send your vortices at a wall. You'll see the dark

**Transcript**:
If you look at the wake behind a duck, or
a kayak, or a ship, you might notice two unusual things: first, the wake isn’t simple (like
the perfectly straight shock wake of a supersonic projectile is) - it’s a fascinating, feathery,
ripple-y pattern. And second, that feathery pattern looks the
same - same angle, same repeating pattern of ripples along the edge, same reverse arcs
in the middle - it looks more or less the same regardless of whether it’s made by
a duck, a kayak or a ship, even though they’re all moving at different speeds and the waves
are very different sizes. The reason water wakes always have this particular
shape and pattern is because of the surprising physics of water waves. While there's a single speed of light waves,
and a single speed of sound waves, there's no single speed of water waves. In water, longer waves travel faster, while
shorter waves travel slower. This phenomenon where different wavelength
waves travel at different speeds is known as dispersion, and it makes water waves both
interesting and complicated. Like a boat wake. To explain the shape of a boat wake, we’ll
start by looking at water waves of just a single wavelength (and speed). A boat traveling across this simpler water
creates a series of circular waves - if the water waves are faster than the boat, the
waves encircle it, but you don’t get a wake. If the waves are slower than the boat, the
boat outruns them and the circles all add together to create a V-shaped wake. And if the waves are even slower, the boat
will outrun them even more and they’ll add together to a narrower V shape. Slower waves make narrower wakes. Faster waves make wider wakes. But we need to remember that water waves are
waves, that is, they repeat themselves. So every circular wave is really the first
of a series of circular waves. This means that instead of creating just one
v-shaped wake, a moving boat creates a train of v-shaped wakes that are each exactly one
wavelength apart. The reason a real boat doesn’t make straight
v-shaped wakes is that a real boat makes waves of many different wavelengths. And because of dispersion, different wavelengths
travel at different speeds: the longer ones travel faster and shorter ones travel slower. Faster waves create wider wakes, and because
faster waves also have longer wavelengths, that means that wider wakes are further apart. Similarly, slower waves create narrower wakes,
and because slower waves also have shorter wavelengths, narrower wakes are closer together. When you add together narrow, closely spaced
wakes, with wider, more widely spaced wakes, with even wider, even more widely separated
wakes, and so on, voilá! The shape of a boat wake! Look at the beautiful repeating feathery ripples
out on the edge, and the wider repeating arcs inside the wake itself. If you replace these sharp lines with smoother
waves at the appropriate angles and spacings, you get an even more convincing boat wake. And we can do the same again in 3D to get
a really realistic-looking boat wake. So in summary: wakes have the shape they do
because water waves travel at different speeds. Slower water waves create narrow, closely
spaced V-shaped wakes, and faster water waves create wider V-shaped wakes that are further
apart. When you add all these different v-shaped
patterns together, at the correct angles and spacings determined by water's dispersion
relation, you end up with the unique shape of a water wake. SPONSORSHIP MESSAGE:

This episode is supported by Edx. Termites, prairie dogs, and people are all
great builders, each in their own way. And we all share one crucial problem. Put a bunch of us in a closed space, breathing
Oxygen in and CO2 out… and it doesn’t end well. Our tallest skyscrapers and deepest mines
are almost completely cut off from outside air. To keep those inside from suffocating, human
engineers use giant machines to bring in fresh air and pump stale air out. Termite mounds have the same problem. The largest are more than 10 meters high. On a human scale, that’s like a skyscraper
three and a half kilometers tall! Only instead of condos and offices, it holds
one big farm. The termites collect wood, which grows fungus,
that the termites eat. All that fungus and the millions of termites
that tend to it create a ton of CO2, which would suffocate the colony *and* their crops
if it builds up. To keep the air fresh, the whole mound acts
like a big lung. During the day, the sun heats the outer chambers
more rapidly than the core, moving air up the outside and down the middle. During the night, this current reverses as
the outer chambers lose heat to the cool night air. The whole time, CO2 and oxygen are exchanged
through tiny holes in the outer walls. What’s amazing is this is all constructed
without a boss. No central architect designing the structure. Just instinct and cooperation lets termites
build huge ventilation engines powered by nothing but daily temperature cycles. Leafcutter ants farm fungus on massive scales
too. One colony in South America covered nearly
50 square meters and was home to over 8 million ants! But unlike those towering termites, the ant
labyrinth reached 8 meters underground. So how do they ventilate their agricultural
city? Before we answer that, I want you to try something. Take a piece of paper, hold it under your
lips, and let the other end curl down. If you blow only across the top of the paper,
what do you think will happen? The force of the air hitting the paper should
push it down, right? Well watch this. Here’s what’s happening: Air is a fluid. When I force air across the top of the paper,
that stream pulls other air along, due to viscosity, which is like the friction of
fluids. This leaves an area of low pressure behind, and the paper is pulled up to fill
it. This is called the Coandă effect. What does that have to do with ants? Check this out. When a breeze flows over a hill, the air is
deflected over the top. This pulls air along too, just like when I blew over the paper, drawing air out of the ant hill along the
way. The ants build lower entrances nearby, where
air is drawn in to replace it, ventilating the whole colony with a little breeze. Prairie dogs get the same effect from their
mounds. Breezes over taller hills draw air through
the connected tunnel system, keeping the whole town breathing fresh. There’s even a tiny shrimp that uses this
same system to keep fresh water flowing through its burrows. Persian and Egyptian architects have used
similar structures to cool buildings for centuries, but tiny animals beat us to that technology
by millions of years Nature is full of species that build their
environment to suit them, countless expert animal architects. Sometimes, all you need to solve the most
complex engineering problems is the awesome power of evolution, …and that’s a breath of fresh air. Stay curious. Thanks to edX, our non-profit partner for

**Transcript**:
This episode is supported by Edx. Termites, prairie dogs, and people are all
great builders, each in their own way. And we all share one crucial problem. Put a bunch of us in a closed space, breathing
Oxygen in and CO2 out… and it doesn’t end well. Our tallest skyscrapers and deepest mines
are almost completely cut off from outside air. To keep those inside from suffocating, human
engineers use giant machines to bring in fresh air and pump stale air out. Termite mounds have the same problem. The largest are more than 10 meters high. On a human scale, that’s like a skyscraper
three and a half kilometers tall! Only instead of condos and offices, it holds
one big farm. The termites collect wood, which grows fungus,
that the termites eat. All that fungus and the millions of termites
that tend to it create a ton of CO2, which would suffocate the colony *and* their crops
if it builds up. To keep the air fresh, the whole mound acts
like a big lung. During the day, the sun heats the outer chambers
more rapidly than the core, moving air up the outside and down the middle. During the night, this current reverses as
the outer chambers lose heat to the cool night air. The whole time, CO2 and oxygen are exchanged
through tiny holes in the outer walls. What’s amazing is this is all constructed
without a boss. No central architect designing the structure. Just instinct and cooperation lets termites
build huge ventilation engines powered by nothing but daily temperature cycles. Leafcutter ants farm fungus on massive scales
too. One colony in South America covered nearly
50 square meters and was home to over 8 million ants! But unlike those towering termites, the ant
labyrinth reached 8 meters underground. So how do they ventilate their agricultural
city? Before we answer that, I want you to try something. Take a piece of paper, hold it under your
lips, and let the other end curl down. If you blow only across the top of the paper,
what do you think will happen? The force of the air hitting the paper should
push it down, right? Well watch this. Here’s what’s happening: Air is a fluid. When I force air across the top of the paper,
that stream pulls other air along, due to viscosity, which is like the friction of
fluids. This leaves an area of low pressure behind, and the paper is pulled up to fill
it. This is called the Coandă effect. What does that have to do with ants? Check this out. When a breeze flows over a hill, the air is
deflected over the top. This pulls air along too, just like when I blew over the paper, drawing air out of the ant hill along the
way. The ants build lower entrances nearby, where
air is drawn in to replace it, ventilating the whole colony with a little breeze. Prairie dogs get the same effect from their
mounds. Breezes over taller hills draw air through
the connected tunnel system, keeping the whole town breathing fresh. There’s even a tiny shrimp that uses this
same system to keep fresh water flowing through its burrows. Persian and Egyptian architects have used
similar structures to cool buildings for centuries, but tiny animals beat us to that technology
by millions of years Nature is full of species that build their
environment to suit them, countless expert animal architects. Sometimes, all you need to solve the most
complex engineering problems is the awesome power of evolution, …and that’s a breath of fresh air. Stay curious. Thanks to edX, our non-profit partner for

**Transcript**:
you our motivations are unbelievably interesting I mean I find I've been working on this for a few years and I just find the topic still so amazingly engaging and interesting so I want to tell you about that the science is really surprising the science is a little bit freaky okay if we are not as endlessly manipulable and as predictable as you would think there's a whole set of unbelievably interesting studies I want to give you two that call into question this idea that if you reward something you get more of the behavior you want if you punish something you get less of it so let's talk let's go from London to the mean streets of Cambridge Massachusetts in the northeastern part of the United States and let's talk about a study done at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology here's what they did they took a whole group of students and they gave them a set of challenges things like um memorizing strings of digits solving word puzzles other kinds of spacial puzzles even physical tasks like throwing a ball through a hoop okay they gave him these challenges and they said to incentivize their performance they gave them three levels of rewards okay so if you did pretty well you got a small monetary reward if you did medium-well you've got a medium monetary reward and if you did really well if you were one of the top performers you've got a large cash prize okay we've seen this movie before this is essentially a typical motivation scheme within organizations right we reward the very top performers we ignore the low performers and the other folks kind of in the middle okay you get a little bit so what happens they do the test they have these incentives here's what they found out one as long as the tasks involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better their performance okay that makes sense but here's what happens but once the tasks call for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance now this is strange right a larger reward led to poorer performance how can that possibly be now what's interesting about this is that these folks here who did this are all economists at two at MIT one at the University of Chicago one at Carnegie Mellon okay the top tier of the economics profession they're reaching this conclusion that seems contrary to what a lot of us learned in economics which is which is that the higher the reward the better their performance and they're saying that once you get above rudimentary cognitive skill it's the other way around which seems like this kind of the idea that these rewards don't work that way seems vaguely the left-wing and socialist doesn't it it's kind of this kind of weird socialist conspiracy for those of you who have those conspiracy theories I want to point out the so the notoriously left-wing socialist group that financed the research the Federal Reserve Bank so this is the mainstream of the mainstream coming to a conclusion that's quite surprising seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics so this is strange it's strange funny so what do they do they say let's this is this is freaky let's go test it somewhere else maybe that fifty dollars a sixty dollar prize isn't sufficiently motivating for an MIT student right so let's go to a place where fifty dollars is actually more significant relatively all right so we take the experiment we're gonna go to mathura india rural india where $50 $60 whatever the number was is actually significant sum of money so they replicated the experiment in india roughly as follows small rewards the equivalent of two weeks salary i'm sorry small performance low performance two weeks salary medium performance about a month salary high performance about two months salary okay so there's a real good incentives okay so you're gonna get a different result here well what happened though was that the people offered the medium reward did no better than the people offered the small reward but this time around the people offered the top reward they did worst of all higher incentives led to worse performance what's interesting about this is that it actually isn't all that anomalous this has been replicated over and over and over again by psychologists by some extent by sociologists and by economists over and over and over again for simple straightforward tasks those kinds of incentives if you do this then you get that they're great for the task that our algorithmic set of rules where you have to just follow along and get a right answer if then rewards carrots and sticks outstanding but when the task gets more complicated when it requires some conceptual creative thinking those kinds of motivators demonstrably don't work fact money is a motivator at work but in a slightly strange way if you don't pay people enough they won't be motivated what's curious about there's another paradox here which is that the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table pay people enough so that they're not thinking about money and they're thinking about the work now once you do that it turns out there are three factors that the science shows lead to the better performance not to mention personal satisfaction autonomy mastery and purpose autonomy is our desire to be self-directed to direct our own lives now in many ways traditional notions of management run afoul of that management is great if you want compliance but if you want engagement which is what we want in the workforce today as people are doing more complicated sophisticated things self-direction is better let me give you some examples of this almost radical forms of self direction in the workplace that lead to good results let's start with this company right here Atlassian an Australian company it's a software company and they do something really cool once a quarter on a Thursday afternoon they say to their developers for the next 24 hours you can work on anything you want you can work on it the way you want you can work on it with whomever you want all we ask is that you show the results to the company at the end of those 24 hours and this fun kind of meeting not a Star Chamber session but this fun meeting with beer and cake and fun and other things like that it turns out that that one day of pure undiluted autonomy has led to a whole array of fixes for existing software a whole array of ideas for new products that otherwise had never emerged one day now this is not an if-then incentive this is not the sort of thing that I would have done three years ago before I knew this research I would have said you want people to be creative and innovative give them a freaking innovation bonus if you could do something cool I'll give you $2,500 they're not doing this at all they're essentially saying you probably want to do something interesting let me just get out of your way one day of autonomy produces things that had never emerged let's talk about mastery masteries are urged to get better at stuff we like to get better at stuff this is why people play musical instruments on the weekend you got all these people who are acting in ways at sea irrational economically they play musical instruments on weekends why it's not gonna get them a mate it's not gonna make them any money why are they doing it cuz it's fun cuz you get better at it and that's satisfying go back in time a little bit imagine I imagine this if I went to my first economics professor a woman named Mary Alice Shulman and I went to her in 1983 and said professor Shulman can I talk to you after class for a moment yeah just I got this inkling I got this idea for a business model I just want to run it past you here's how it would work you get a bunch of people around the world who are doing highly-skilled work but they're willing to do it for free and volunteer their time 20 sometimes 30 hours a week okay she's looking at you somewhat skeptically there oh but but I'm not done and then what they create they give it away rather than sell it it's gonna be huge I mean she would have she truly would have thought I was insane okay it seemed to fly in the face of so many things but what do you have you have Linux powering one out of four corporate servers and fortune 500 companies Apache powering more than the majority of web servers Wikipedia what's going on why are why are people doing this why are they why are these people many of whom are technically sophisticated highly skilled people who have jobs okay they have jobs they're working at jobs for pay doing challenging doing sophisticated technical technological work and yet during their limited discretionary time they do equally if not more technically sophisticated work not for their employer but for someone else for free that's a strange economic behavior economists would look into it why are they doing this it's overwhelmingly clear challenge and mastery along with making a contribution that's it what you see more and more is a rise of what you might call the purpose motive is that more and more organizations want to have some kind of transcendent purpose partly because it makes coming to work better partly because that's the way to get better talent and what we're saying now is in some ways when the profit motive becomes unmoored from the purpose motive bad things happen bad things ethically sometimes but also bad thing just like not good stuff like crappy products like lame services like uninspiring places to work that when the profit motive is is is paramount or when it becomes completely unhitch from the purpose motive it's just people don't do great thing more and more organizations are realizing this and sort of disturbing the categories between what's profit and what's and what's purpose and and I think that that actually heralds something interesting and I think that the companies that organizations that are flourishing whether they're profit for profit are somewhere in between are animated by this purpose motor let me give you a couple of examples here's the founder of Skype he says our goal is to be disruptive but in the cause of making the world a better place pretty good purpose here's Steve Jobs I want to put a ding in the universe all right that's the kind of thing that might get you up in the morning racing to go to work so I think that um that we our purpose maximizers not only profit maximizers I think the science shows that we care about mastery very very deeply and the science shows that we want to be self-directed and I think that the big takeaway here is that if we start treating people like people and not assuming that they're simply horses you know slower smaller better smelling horses if we get past this kind of ideology of carrots and sticks and look at the science I think we can actually build organizations and work lives that make us better off but I also think they have the promise to make our world just a little bit better you

**Transcript**:
you our motivations are unbelievably interesting I mean I find I've been working on this for a few years and I just find the topic still so amazingly engaging and interesting so I want to tell you about that the science is really surprising the science is a little bit freaky okay if we are not as endlessly manipulable and as predictable as you would think there's a whole set of unbelievably interesting studies I want to give you two that call into question this idea that if you reward something you get more of the behavior you want if you punish something you get less of it so let's talk let's go from London to the mean streets of Cambridge Massachusetts in the northeastern part of the United States and let's talk about a study done at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology here's what they did they took a whole group of students and they gave them a set of challenges things like um memorizing strings of digits solving word puzzles other kinds of spacial puzzles even physical tasks like throwing a ball through a hoop okay they gave him these challenges and they said to incentivize their performance they gave them three levels of rewards okay so if you did pretty well you got a small monetary reward if you did medium-well you've got a medium monetary reward and if you did really well if you were one of the top performers you've got a large cash prize okay we've seen this movie before this is essentially a typical motivation scheme within organizations right we reward the very top performers we ignore the low performers and the other folks kind of in the middle okay you get a little bit so what happens they do the test they have these incentives here's what they found out one as long as the tasks involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better their performance okay that makes sense but here's what happens but once the tasks call for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance now this is strange right a larger reward led to poorer performance how can that possibly be now what's interesting about this is that these folks here who did this are all economists at two at MIT one at the University of Chicago one at Carnegie Mellon okay the top tier of the economics profession they're reaching this conclusion that seems contrary to what a lot of us learned in economics which is which is that the higher the reward the better their performance and they're saying that once you get above rudimentary cognitive skill it's the other way around which seems like this kind of the idea that these rewards don't work that way seems vaguely the left-wing and socialist doesn't it it's kind of this kind of weird socialist conspiracy for those of you who have those conspiracy theories I want to point out the so the notoriously left-wing socialist group that financed the research the Federal Reserve Bank so this is the mainstream of the mainstream coming to a conclusion that's quite surprising seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics so this is strange it's strange funny so what do they do they say let's this is this is freaky let's go test it somewhere else maybe that fifty dollars a sixty dollar prize isn't sufficiently motivating for an MIT student right so let's go to a place where fifty dollars is actually more significant relatively all right so we take the experiment we're gonna go to mathura india rural india where $50 $60 whatever the number was is actually significant sum of money so they replicated the experiment in india roughly as follows small rewards the equivalent of two weeks salary i'm sorry small performance low performance two weeks salary medium performance about a month salary high performance about two months salary okay so there's a real good incentives okay so you're gonna get a different result here well what happened though was that the people offered the medium reward did no better than the people offered the small reward but this time around the people offered the top reward they did worst of all higher incentives led to worse performance what's interesting about this is that it actually isn't all that anomalous this has been replicated over and over and over again by psychologists by some extent by sociologists and by economists over and over and over again for simple straightforward tasks those kinds of incentives if you do this then you get that they're great for the task that our algorithmic set of rules where you have to just follow along and get a right answer if then rewards carrots and sticks outstanding but when the task gets more complicated when it requires some conceptual creative thinking those kinds of motivators demonstrably don't work fact money is a motivator at work but in a slightly strange way if you don't pay people enough they won't be motivated what's curious about there's another paradox here which is that the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table pay people enough so that they're not thinking about money and they're thinking about the work now once you do that it turns out there are three factors that the science shows lead to the better performance not to mention personal satisfaction autonomy mastery and purpose autonomy is our desire to be self-directed to direct our own lives now in many ways traditional notions of management run afoul of that management is great if you want compliance but if you want engagement which is what we want in the workforce today as people are doing more complicated sophisticated things self-direction is better let me give you some examples of this almost radical forms of self direction in the workplace that lead to good results let's start with this company right here Atlassian an Australian company it's a software company and they do something really cool once a quarter on a Thursday afternoon they say to their developers for the next 24 hours you can work on anything you want you can work on it the way you want you can work on it with whomever you want all we ask is that you show the results to the company at the end of those 24 hours and this fun kind of meeting not a Star Chamber session but this fun meeting with beer and cake and fun and other things like that it turns out that that one day of pure undiluted autonomy has led to a whole array of fixes for existing software a whole array of ideas for new products that otherwise had never emerged one day now this is not an if-then incentive this is not the sort of thing that I would have done three years ago before I knew this research I would have said you want people to be creative and innovative give them a freaking innovation bonus if you could do something cool I'll give you $2,500 they're not doing this at all they're essentially saying you probably want to do something interesting let me just get out of your way one day of autonomy produces things that had never emerged let's talk about mastery masteries are urged to get better at stuff we like to get better at stuff this is why people play musical instruments on the weekend you got all these people who are acting in ways at sea irrational economically they play musical instruments on weekends why it's not gonna get them a mate it's not gonna make them any money why are they doing it cuz it's fun cuz you get better at it and that's satisfying go back in time a little bit imagine I imagine this if I went to my first economics professor a woman named Mary Alice Shulman and I went to her in 1983 and said professor Shulman can I talk to you after class for a moment yeah just I got this inkling I got this idea for a business model I just want to run it past you here's how it would work you get a bunch of people around the world who are doing highly-skilled work but they're willing to do it for free and volunteer their time 20 sometimes 30 hours a week okay she's looking at you somewhat skeptically there oh but but I'm not done and then what they create they give it away rather than sell it it's gonna be huge I mean she would have she truly would have thought I was insane okay it seemed to fly in the face of so many things but what do you have you have Linux powering one out of four corporate servers and fortune 500 companies Apache powering more than the majority of web servers Wikipedia what's going on why are why are people doing this why are they why are these people many of whom are technically sophisticated highly skilled people who have jobs okay they have jobs they're working at jobs for pay doing challenging doing sophisticated technical technological work and yet during their limited discretionary time they do equally if not more technically sophisticated work not for their employer but for someone else for free that's a strange economic behavior economists would look into it why are they doing this it's overwhelmingly clear challenge and mastery along with making a contribution that's it what you see more and more is a rise of what you might call the purpose motive is that more and more organizations want to have some kind of transcendent purpose partly because it makes coming to work better partly because that's the way to get better talent and what we're saying now is in some ways when the profit motive becomes unmoored from the purpose motive bad things happen bad things ethically sometimes but also bad thing just like not good stuff like crappy products like lame services like uninspiring places to work that when the profit motive is is is paramount or when it becomes completely unhitch from the purpose motive it's just people don't do great thing more and more organizations are realizing this and sort of disturbing the categories between what's profit and what's and what's purpose and and I think that that actually heralds something interesting and I think that the companies that organizations that are flourishing whether they're profit for profit are somewhere in between are animated by this purpose motor let me give you a couple of examples here's the founder of Skype he says our goal is to be disruptive but in the cause of making the world a better place pretty good purpose here's Steve Jobs I want to put a ding in the universe all right that's the kind of thing that might get you up in the morning racing to go to work so I think that um that we our purpose maximizers not only profit maximizers I think the science shows that we care about mastery very very deeply and the science shows that we want to be self-directed and I think that the big takeaway here is that if we start treating people like people and not assuming that they're simply horses you know slower smaller better smelling horses if we get past this kind of ideology of carrots and sticks and look at the science I think we can actually build organizations and work lives that make us better off but I also think they have the promise to make our world just a little bit better you

**Transcript**:
"1980." The 80s were all about 
big hair, neon, MTV. And then there was this: "Every October a hole appears in the 
ozone layer over the south pole." "...hole in the ozone shield is the size
of the continental United States." "The protective ozone layer is 
being threatened as never before." "We are all at risk." Scientists warned that humanity was on track
to completely destroy the ozone layer by 2050. Without it ecosystems would collapse, skin cancer rates would skyrocket, and life as we knew it would cease to exist. But today, the ozone layer is healing. In an unprecedented act, the world came together
to prevent an environmental catastrophe. So how did we do it? And what can we learn from it? The ozone layer is a sort of “belt” around
the Earth made up of gaseous molecules. It protects every living thing by absorbing two types of 
ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It’s a powerful shield, but 
it’s also fragile. In 1985, scientists discovered a 
massive loss of ozone here:  right over Antarctica. 40% of the layer had dissipated,
creating a “hole”. Scientists realized the hole formed in the
spring and every year it got worse. This was a wake up call. It wasn't small and far in the future. It was now and way bigger 
than anybody ever imagined. That’s Dr. Solomon, an atmospheric chemist. In 1986, she flew to Antarctica, 
along with other scientists to investigate the cause of the ozone hole. “Leading the team is Susan Solomon, a young atmospheric chemist 
from Boulder, Colorado." You know once you step off the plane in Antarctica, if you've never been there before, your main goal is to get out 
without getting frostbite. "Do you want to do the next one?" But what really our goal was to take measurements, not just of ozone, but also of different chemicals
that would help to show why it was going away. Some scientists released balloons in the sky
to take ozone measurements. While others took measurements on the ground. And they all came to the same conclusion. The biggest problem was chlorine from a man-made
compound called Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On the ground CFCs aren’t harmful. But once they float up to the stratosphere
the Sun breaks them down into chlorine. They bind with ozone to make 
oxygen and chlorine monoxide. Then the loose oxygen atoms 
bump the chlorine atom out, freeing it to destroy more ozone molecules. And that causes a chain reaction. The long lifetime of the chlorofluorocarbons
is a big part of the problem. They live anywhere between 50 and 150 years
in our atmosphere so... It means that every year that you use what you use the year before 
is almost entirely still there. So it just builds up and builds up exponentially. And back then we used a lot of CFCs. The US had already moved away 
from CFCs in aerosol cans. But most of the world hadn’t yet. And they were still in everything from refrigerators
and air conditioners and styrofoam. The entire world needed to make a big change
quickly or we’d face-- Catastrophe. Catastrophe. Unmitigated catastrophe. In 1987, ozone levels had dropped 
by 50 percent. This growing threat led to some of the fastest
collective action on climate we've ever seen. So I like to think of it as, there's three
P's that when, they’re met we do very well at addressing environmental problems. So it was personal. It was perceptible and the solutions 
were practical. If you've been sunburned, you know that 
skin cancer is not a good thing. So everybody understands skin cancer. The personal nature of the threat is huge. The perceptible was easy to do 
with satellite measurements. You can just watch it get 
completely destroyed and go to zero where there should have been a lot of ozone. And we have practical solutions. It was easy to find substitutes for 
chlorofluorocarbons in spray cans that took, you know, less than a year to do. It was a very straightforward switch, And I think the main unifying factor 
in all of that is the public. Scientists like Dr. Solomon held 
press conferences to inform the public. "I think we will eventually see large scale
depletions of the ozone layer in other latitudes." The ozone hole started showing up 
in TV shows and movies. “It’s those damn fluorocarbons, they’ve
been kicking the hell out of the ozone.” “Macaroni, it will burn off.” “Well so will the ozone, eventually.” And all this public awareness put pressure
on leaders around the world to act. “We are here today because we recognize
that urgent action is necessary.” And the Montreal Protocol made it official. It recognized “that world-wide emissions
can significantly deplete the ozone layer and result in adverse effects on human health
and the environment." It listed control measures to reduce ozone
depleting substances in a series of steps. Including help for developing countries who need alternative technology 
and substituting products. Every single country eventually 
signed the protocol. Making it the only universal treaty 
to ever be ratified. And the most successful environmental agreement
in human history. Soon after, the world’s largest CFC producer
began to phase them out. Since the protocol went into effect 
on January 1st, 1989 the consumption of ozone-depleting substances  including CFCs, plummeted. Today, more than thirty years after 
the Montreal Protocol was signed the ozone hole has stopped growing 
and is now shrinking. And by 2065 it is expected to 
have recovered completely. But there’s more to be done. After the CFC ban we began using 
Hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs don’t deplete the ozone layer but they
are a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. And it’s the fastest growing one. So in 2016, the Montreal Protocol 
was amended to include HFCs and now they are being phased out too. But they are only one part 
of a larger issue. "Climate change is already happening, 
right here, right now." "Experts say that we have until 2030 
to avoid catastrophe." "People are suffering." "People are dying." "Entire ecosystems are collapsing." "Unprecedented and even irreversible changes
are happening to this planet." "It is beyond any doubt that 
human activity is to blame." Climate change, our most challenging environmental
problem is still in need of big solutions. So I think people in most parts 
of the world, now understand and are concerned about, 
the personal impact. They found it to be perceptible. And we are finding practical solutions. It's not true that we can't do it anymore. We need to keep our eye on the ball 
on climate change. And if we do we will get the environment 
that we demand.

**Transcript**:
"1980." The 80s were all about 
big hair, neon, MTV. And then there was this: "Every October a hole appears in the 
ozone layer over the south pole." "...hole in the ozone shield is the size
of the continental United States." "The protective ozone layer is 
being threatened as never before." "We are all at risk." Scientists warned that humanity was on track
to completely destroy the ozone layer by 2050. Without it ecosystems would collapse, skin cancer rates would skyrocket, and life as we knew it would cease to exist. But today, the ozone layer is healing. In an unprecedented act, the world came together
to prevent an environmental catastrophe. So how did we do it? And what can we learn from it? The ozone layer is a sort of “belt” around
the Earth made up of gaseous molecules. It protects every living thing by absorbing two types of 
ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It’s a powerful shield, but 
it’s also fragile. In 1985, scientists discovered a 
massive loss of ozone here:  right over Antarctica. 40% of the layer had dissipated,
creating a “hole”. Scientists realized the hole formed in the
spring and every year it got worse. This was a wake up call. It wasn't small and far in the future. It was now and way bigger 
than anybody ever imagined. That’s Dr. Solomon, an atmospheric chemist. In 1986, she flew to Antarctica, 
along with other scientists to investigate the cause of the ozone hole. “Leading the team is Susan Solomon, a young atmospheric chemist 
from Boulder, Colorado." You know once you step off the plane in Antarctica, if you've never been there before, your main goal is to get out 
without getting frostbite. "Do you want to do the next one?" But what really our goal was to take measurements, not just of ozone, but also of different chemicals
that would help to show why it was going away. Some scientists released balloons in the sky
to take ozone measurements. While others took measurements on the ground. And they all came to the same conclusion. The biggest problem was chlorine from a man-made
compound called Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On the ground CFCs aren’t harmful. But once they float up to the stratosphere
the Sun breaks them down into chlorine. They bind with ozone to make 
oxygen and chlorine monoxide. Then the loose oxygen atoms 
bump the chlorine atom out, freeing it to destroy more ozone molecules. And that causes a chain reaction. The long lifetime of the chlorofluorocarbons
is a big part of the problem. They live anywhere between 50 and 150 years
in our atmosphere so... It means that every year that you use what you use the year before 
is almost entirely still there. So it just builds up and builds up exponentially. And back then we used a lot of CFCs. The US had already moved away 
from CFCs in aerosol cans. But most of the world hadn’t yet. And they were still in everything from refrigerators
and air conditioners and styrofoam. The entire world needed to make a big change
quickly or we’d face-- Catastrophe. Catastrophe. Unmitigated catastrophe. In 1987, ozone levels had dropped 
by 50 percent. This growing threat led to some of the fastest
collective action on climate we've ever seen. So I like to think of it as, there's three
P's that when, they’re met we do very well at addressing environmental problems. So it was personal. It was perceptible and the solutions 
were practical. If you've been sunburned, you know that 
skin cancer is not a good thing. So everybody understands skin cancer. The personal nature of the threat is huge. The perceptible was easy to do 
with satellite measurements. You can just watch it get 
completely destroyed and go to zero where there should have been a lot of ozone. And we have practical solutions. It was easy to find substitutes for 
chlorofluorocarbons in spray cans that took, you know, less than a year to do. It was a very straightforward switch, And I think the main unifying factor 
in all of that is the public. Scientists like Dr. Solomon held 
press conferences to inform the public. "I think we will eventually see large scale
depletions of the ozone layer in other latitudes." The ozone hole started showing up 
in TV shows and movies. “It’s those damn fluorocarbons, they’ve
been kicking the hell out of the ozone.” “Macaroni, it will burn off.” “Well so will the ozone, eventually.” And all this public awareness put pressure
on leaders around the world to act. “We are here today because we recognize
that urgent action is necessary.” And the Montreal Protocol made it official. It recognized “that world-wide emissions
can significantly deplete the ozone layer and result in adverse effects on human health
and the environment." It listed control measures to reduce ozone
depleting substances in a series of steps. Including help for developing countries who need alternative technology 
and substituting products. Every single country eventually 
signed the protocol. Making it the only universal treaty 
to ever be ratified. And the most successful environmental agreement
in human history. Soon after, the world’s largest CFC producer
began to phase them out. Since the protocol went into effect 
on January 1st, 1989 the consumption of ozone-depleting substances  including CFCs, plummeted. Today, more than thirty years after 
the Montreal Protocol was signed the ozone hole has stopped growing 
and is now shrinking. And by 2065 it is expected to 
have recovered completely. But there’s more to be done. After the CFC ban we began using 
Hydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs don’t deplete the ozone layer but they
are a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. And it’s the fastest growing one. So in 2016, the Montreal Protocol 
was amended to include HFCs and now they are being phased out too. But they are only one part 
of a larger issue. "Climate change is already happening, 
right here, right now." "Experts say that we have until 2030 
to avoid catastrophe." "People are suffering." "People are dying." "Entire ecosystems are collapsing." "Unprecedented and even irreversible changes
are happening to this planet." "It is beyond any doubt that 
human activity is to blame." Climate change, our most challenging environmental
problem is still in need of big solutions. So I think people in most parts 
of the world, now understand and are concerned about, 
the personal impact. They found it to be perceptible. And we are finding practical solutions. It's not true that we can't do it anymore. We need to keep our eye on the ball 
on climate change. And if we do we will get the environment 
that we demand.

February is home to one of the most important
holidays of the year not to forget: Groundhog Day. If you live outside of Can-merica then you
might not know what a groundhog is so... here you go: this is a groundhog. They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who
dig burrows underground. Burrows large enough, in fact, to occasionally
make their comfy home a structural hazard to your comfy home. This explains the first half of their name. The second half is because they're kind of
fat -- though unlike their fellow Can-mericans -- when winter arrives they need their excess
weight to go into hibernation. The story of the holiday is that on February
2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation to peek out of their burrow and look at the
world. If they see their shadow they go back inside
which predicts six more weeks of winter. If they don't, then spring will come early. The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania
Dutch custom of weather prediction and today is celebrated in Canada and 49 of the fifty
states, the exception being Alaska which in 2009 decided to forgo groundhog day in favor
of marmot day. Outside of Alaska, many groundhogs contend
with each other to be the King of Seasonal Weather prediction their their main weapon
in this war being their delightful names such as: Queen Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North
Carolina, Shubenacadie Sam of Nova Scotia Staten Island Chuck from New York French Creek Freddie in West Virginia And... Gus from Athens Georgia though this last groundhog
is somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor, General Beauregard Lee, who one must assume
has stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation home while drinking
Mint Julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again. 1,000 miles north of the General, Wiarton
Willie is the groundhog king of Canada, who throws an annual party to help him stay on
top and make sure that people keep building epic statues of him. But, if there could be only one, Punxsutawney
Phil would be him. Not only is his name the most fun to say but
he also has quite a posse of top-hatted, tuxedoed men who look after him and call themselves
the inner circle. According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been
making predictions since the 1880s. Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this
Punxsutawney Phil who is functionally immortal because of a magic life-extending elixir the
inner circle members prepare for him so that he can continue to make predictions -- and
bring in tourist revenue -- until the end of time. He also speaks a language called groundhogese
that only the president of the inner circle can understand. If you think that Groundhog day is a dumb,
pointless holiday then, there are two things you should consider: 1st: you have no sense of fun and 2nd, you
better be careful on Groundhog day, because in addition to their weather predicting day
jobs, these groundhogs also have the magical power to trap you in a infinite time loop
until you learn to be less of a jerk. Happy Groundhog Day�

bring in tourist revenue -- until the end of time. He also speaks a language called groundhogese
that only the president of the inner circle can understand. If you think that Groundhog day is a dumb,
pointless holiday then, there are two things you should consider: 1st: you have no sense of fun and 2nd, you
better be careful on Groundhog day, because in addition to their weather predicting day
jobs, these groundhogs also have the magical power to trap you in a infinite time loop
until you learn to be less of a jerk. Happy Groundhog Day�

**Transcript**:
With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider
info on AsapSCIENCE and behind the scenes, check it out with the link in the description! Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and Twitter. We also finally got a PO Box, for all of you

And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider

**Transcript**:
With social media sites being used by ⅓ of the entire world, they’ve clearly had an major influence on society. But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media
users to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking
online reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder
for your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle
of productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively
new psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.
In one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.
It would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.
As crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains
are being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine
- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in
people’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as
opposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?
But it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own
experiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain
related to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and
even more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for
talking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,
studies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet
for the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s
because people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there
is a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet
has changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the
ones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us
questions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform
we could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT! So if you feel getting some insider

[MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: Thanks to Curiosity
Stream for supporting PBS Digital Studios.  So stay like this, and
then lift up like this. Use this momentum to kick
your legs up even if you don't go all the way yet. And like bend your legs,
and see if you can go to just the top of your head.  Just kidding. Hey. I'm Diana. You're watching "Physics Girl." And last week, I got to
hang out with contortionist and YouTuber, Sophie Dossi. We did some science
experiments for her channel. And while we were hanging out,
I realized that, as a physicist, I know absolutely
nothing about what stretching does to your
body and whether there is a scientifically-supported
way of becoming more flexible. There is. Stay tuned. I didn't know, so I
headed over to USC to meet with a bio mechanist
to find out the latest science.  I'm Michael Rowley. I am a PhD candidate
in the division of biokinesiology
and physical therapy.  My first question
was, is there something different about Sophie?  I'm just going to
get into a back bend, and like lift up my feet.  Oh my gosh.  Yes, yes. Very different. But I mean, like
biomechanically, does she have a superpower?  There's evidence that people
who are hyper flexible--  Quick pause. Hyper flexible or hypermobile
is actually a scientific term. And there is a test used to
determine whether someone is hyper flexible. It's called the
Beighton score, and I'll link to it in the description
if you want to test yourself. OK. So people who are hypermobile--  Those people have a
little bit more relatively of the more stretchy collagen
than the type I collagen.  Uh-huh. I need a quick refresher on
collagen. Take it away Michael.  So a bone to bone
connection is a ligament. And then a muscle to bone
connection is the tendon. Tendons and
ligaments are made up of mostly collagen, which
is a type of protein. And there's different
types of collagen. So tendons and ligaments have
primarily type I collagen, which is a really strong type,
and then also some type III collagen, which will
be more stretchy, and then may also include
some elastin, which is another type of
connective tissue that's very elastic
and stretchy. So the ratios of those
things can be different.  Got it. So Sophie might actually have
a different material makeup of the tissues in
her body, like she might have more of that
type III collagen, which would allow her to do things
that the average person can't do.  Fact was, I almost can't
overstretch anymore because I'm just completely in half. So it's like I have
pushed the limit on that, like there's just-- I mean you can't--
you're not a ghost. You're not a ghost.  But how flexible is Sophie?  Yeah. Before I started
contortion, I was always more flexible than
that average gymnast.  Oh, than even the
average gymnast.  Yes.  Not even the average person.  Yeah. When I was little,
I use to watch TV with my feet over my head.  Yeah. That's flexible. OK. But how do you get
flexible biomechanically? I guess my first question
is, when you stretch, what parts of your body
are stretching out? Yeah.  So when you stretch, you're
going to increase flexibility and excursion in all those
tissues-- muscles, tendons, ligaments. The most short-term, the
fastest, most acute effects will be in the muscle.  So your tendons
and your ligaments are stretching out too? How does that work? They seem so sturdy. This is getting to the heart
of what I really, really want to know, which is, what
is physically happening to all of these tissues?  The actual pieces
of physiology that change with stretching,
the body will change the water content in the material. That's probably the fastest way. And then you can
also induce some stem cells that still live in
the tendon material themselves. And those can differentiate
into more cells. They can produce more
or slightly different types of febrile or
proteins like that collagen that I talked about.  Humph. So your body can change
the material properties of your tissues by stretching? Cool.  Another way is that you
actually modify sensation. So you might experience some
mild pain the first time you're going to stretch,
but you'll actually desensitize yourself to
that pain over repeated stretching multiple days
a week for multiple weeks.  Hold up. Really?  Yeah.  One way of getting
more flexible is just becoming
more numb to pain?  It actually really feels good. It feels like a
nice, good stretch. It doesn't feel like
a hurt stretch at all.  Crazy. I have no chance.  Another change that
happens physiologically with stretching, our muscles have
an alpha-gamma reflex loop. So when you stretch
your muscle, there's this automatic signal that
gets sent to the spinal cord. It doesn't even go up
to the brain and back. The spinal cord then tells
the muscle to contract. That coactivation would be
bad for stretching, right? If you're stretching the
muscle, and then the muscle's trying to pull back on you. So over time, you can actually
down regulate that reflex loop, and that's been shown to
happen when you stretch for long periods of time. Lastly, you actually add
length to the muscle fibers. And you do that by
adding sarcomeres, which are sort of
the contractile unit producing the active
contraction of muscles.  Wow. Bodies are so complicated. So let's recap. Stretching can change the
water content in your muscles, stem cell differentiation,
how much you feel pain, that alpha-gamma reflex
loop from your muscles to your spinal cord, and the
length of your muscle fibers. That's cool. Now I know what's going on
when you get more flexible. Biomechanics is cool, almost
as awesome as physics-- maybe more useful though-- which
brings me to my last question. What does science have to say
about how to get more flexible? Well, Michael pointed me
to this really interesting meta-analysis, which is like
a big study that actually synthesizes all the
findings from other studies, in this case, 23
other studies, which looked at how to get the best
benefits on improved range of motion, or flexibility. And they found that
static stretching, that is when you
ease into a stretch and then hold it for 30
to 60 seconds, that's the best for improved range
of motion, or flexibility. And as far as how
much to stretch, they found that
five minutes total per week of one muscle group
was sort of the lower limit. But you didn't see much more
of a benefit over 10 minutes a week of stretching. And six days out of the week was
the plateau of seeing returns. So the more you
stretch per day doesn't keep increasing the
benefits, but that frequency, six days a week and
then the five minutes total for that week,
is what's important. So commence operation
stretching muscle group for six days a week,
five minutes total. Now, of course, different
types of stretching have different
benefits, so I will link to some of the other
literature in the description. But more importantly
in the description is the video that I did over
with Sophie on her channel. I channeled my inner YouTuber,
and we did a challenge where all the science
experiments I was doing, Sophie had to do with her feet. She's insane. It was amazing. I had so much fun filming with
her, so check out that video and subscribe to

[MUSIC PLAYING] ANNOUNCER: Thanks to Curiosity
Stream for supporting PBS Digital Studios.  So stay like this, and
then lift up like this. Use this momentum to kick
your legs up even if you don't go all the way yet. And like bend your legs,
and see if you can go to just the top of your head.  Just kidding. Hey. I'm Diana. You're watching "Physics Girl." And last week, I got to
hang out with contortionist and YouTuber, Sophie Dossi. We did some science
experiments for her channel. And while we were hanging out,
I realized that, as a physicist, I know absolutely
nothing about what stretching does to your
body and whether there is a scientifically-supported
way of becoming more flexible. There is. Stay tuned. I didn't know, so I
headed over to USC to meet with a bio mechanist
to find out the latest science.  I'm Michael Rowley. I am a PhD candidate
in the division of biokinesiology
and physical therapy.  My first question
was, is there something different about Sophie?  I'm just going to
get into a back bend, and like lift up my feet.  Oh my gosh.  Yes, yes. Very different. But I mean, like
biomechanically, does she have a superpower?  There's evidence that people
who are hyper flexible--  Quick pause. Hyper flexible or hypermobile
is actually a scientific term. And there is a test used to
determine whether someone is hyper flexible. It's called the
Beighton score, and I'll link to it in the description
if you want to test yourself. OK. So people who are hypermobile--  Those people have a
little bit more relatively of the more stretchy collagen
than the type I collagen.  Uh-huh. I need a quick refresher on
collagen. Take it away Michael.  So a bone to bone
connection is a ligament. And then a muscle to bone
connection is the tendon. Tendons and
ligaments are made up of mostly collagen, which
is a type of protein. And there's different
types of collagen. So tendons and ligaments have
primarily type I collagen, which is a really strong type,
and then also some type III collagen, which will
be more stretchy, and then may also include
some elastin, which is another type of
connective tissue that's very elastic
and stretchy. So the ratios of those
things can be different.  Got it. So Sophie might actually have
a different material makeup of the tissues in
her body, like she might have more of that
type III collagen, which would allow her to do things
that the average person can't do.  Fact was, I almost can't
overstretch anymore because I'm just completely in half. So it's like I have
pushed the limit on that, like there's just-- I mean you can't--
you're not a ghost. You're not a ghost.  But how flexible is Sophie?  Yeah. Before I started
contortion, I was always more flexible than
that average gymnast.  Oh, than even the

**Transcript**:
the history books have glorified Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation for freeing slaves but if we're being real it only applies to slaves who live near Union lines where they could flee his or her plantation or take advantage of opportunities in the north around half a million black people manage to do this these black people freed themselves Juneteenth or June 19th is a powerful moment in black history dating back to June 19 1865 the day Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger went into Galveston Texas with news that the Civil War was over in Texas is 200,000 slaves were now officially free [Music] 1865 that's a whole two and a half years after Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in those two years black people's newfound freedom was rejected by white people but general Granger bossed up and issued an order to the people of Texas proclaiming all slaves are free this involves an absolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves and the connection heretofore existing between them becomes that between employers and hired labor and Juneteenth was born our independence day Howard July 4th of course it wasn't black and white like that we weren't free they just announced it this new freedom sparked a violent backlash from white people surprised former Confederate soldiers still in uniform and with guns intimidated black people continuing a new form of slavery they did this by murdering Lin Shaye and harassing the freed slaves hashtag Reconstruction era but we are a resilient people none of their intimidation tactics to stop our ancestors from accepting and celebrating their freedom and they celebrate it defiantly because you know white people rate the first public June peace event took place in 1866 former slaves read the Emancipation Proclamation something pretty gangsta to do in the 1860 south they also sing spirituals and play games the freed men and women of Texas took their celebrations wherever they went Los Angeles Oakland Seattle Chicago Virginia you name it by the 20th century the Jim Crow laws were in full effect freedom started to feel like a foreign concept in June team celebrations didn't happen as often but the fight to freedom had to continue the poor people's March of 1968 brought new life into the holiday in 1980 Texas recognized it as a state holiday and in 1997 Congress recognized June 19th is Juneteenth Independence Day it's been over 150 years since the first Juneteenth isn't it time Juneteenth became a national holiday to see the blackened holiday ever barbecues music dancing a celebration of being free black men and women June 19th is not just about freedom but the fight of our ancestors the determination and the consideration that one day their children their children's children and their children's children's children would be free [Music]

**Transcript**:
"We are hurtling toward the day when climate
change could be irreversible." "Rising sea levels already altering this nation’s
coast." "China’s capital is choking in its worst
pollution of the year." "5% of species will become extinct." "Sea levels rising, glaciers melting." Okay. Enough. I get it. It’s not like I don’t care about polar
bears and melting ice caps. I’m a conservation scientist, so of course
I care. I’ve dedicated my entire career to this. But over the years, one thing has become clear
to me: We need to change the way we talk about climate change. This doom-and-gloom messaging just isn’t
working; we seem to want to tune it out. And this fear, this guilt, we know from psychology
is not conducive to engagement. It's rather the opposite. It makes people passive, because when I feel
fearful or guilt-full, I will withdraw from the issue and try to think about something
else that makes me feel better. And with a problem this overwhelming, it’s
pretty easy to just turn away and kick the can down the road. Somebody else can deal with it. So it’s no wonder that scientists and policymakers
have been struggling with this issue too. So I like to say that climate change is the
policy problem from hell. You almost couldn't design a worse problem
as a fit with our underlying psychology or the way our institutions make decisions. Many Americans continue to think of climate
change as a distant problem: distant in time, that the impacts won't be felt for a generation
or more; and distant in space, that this is about polar bears or maybe some developing
countries. Again, it’s not like we don’t care about
these things — it’s just such a complicated problem. But the thing is, we’ve faced enormous,
scary climate issues before. Remember the hole in the ozone layer? As insurmountable as that seemed in the 1970s
and ’80s, we were able to wrap our heads around that and take action. People got this very simple, easy to understand,
concrete image of this protective layer around the Earth, kind of like a roof, protecting
us, in this case, from ultraviolet light, which by the way has the direct health consequence
of potentially giving you skin cancer. Okay, so now you've got my attention. And so then they came up with this fabulous
term, the “ozone hole.” Terrible problem, great term. People also got a concrete image of how we
even ended up with this problem. For decades, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,
were the main ingredient in a lot of products, like aerosol spray cans. Then scientists discovered that CFCs were
actually destroying the atmospheric ozone. People could look at their own hairspray and
say, “Do I want to destroy the planet because of my hairspray? I mean, god no.” And so what's interesting is that sales of
hairspray and those kinds of products and underarm aerosols started dropping quite dramatically. People listened to scientists and took action. Now scientists predict that the hole in the
ozone layer will be healed around 2050. That’s actually pretty amazing. And while stopping the use of one product
is actually pretty easy, climate change caused by greenhouse gases … that’s much trickier. Because the sources are more complicated,
and for the most part, they’re totally invisible. Right now, there is CO2 pouring out of tailpipes,
there is CO2 pouring out of buildings, there is CO2 pouring out of smokestacks, but
you can't see it. The fundamental cause of this problem is largely
invisible to most of us. I mean, if CO2 was black, we would have dealt
with this issue a long time ago. So CO2 touches every part of our lives — our
cars, the places we work, the food we eat. For now, let’s just focus on one thing:
our energy use. How do we make that visible? That was the initial goal of UCLA’s Engage
project, one of the nation’s largest behavioral experiments in energy conservation. What we're trying to do is to figure out how
to frame information about electricity usage so that people save energy and conserve electricity. The idea is that electricity is relatively
invisible to people. The research team outfitted part of a student
housing complex with meters that tracked real-time usage of appliances and then sent them weekly
reports. So you can see how much energy the stove used
versus the dishwasher or the fridge. We realized, because of this project, the
fridge was like the monster. So lucky for them, their landlord upgraded
their fridge to an energy-efficient one. They also learned other energy-saving tips,
like unplugging their dishwasher when not in use and air-drying their clothes during
the summer months. And researchers, in turn, discovered where
people were willing to cut back. The Engage project wanted to know what types
of messaging could motivate people to change their behavior. We wanted to see over time over a year and
with repeated messages, how do people, behave? How does that impact the consumer behavior? And what we found is that it's very different. Some households were sent personalized emails
with their energy bill about how they could save money; others learned how their energy
usage impacted the environment and children’s health. Those who received messages about saving money
did nothing. It was totally ineffective because electricity
is relatively cheap. But emails sent that linked the amount of
pollutants produced to rates of childhood asthma and cancer — well, those led to an
8% drop in energy use, and 19% in households with kids. Now, in a separate study, researchers brought
social competition into the mix. First, they hung posters around a dorm building
to publicly showcase how students were really doing: red dots for energy wasters, green
for those doing a good job, and a shiny gold star for those going above and beyond. This social pressure approach led to a 20%
reduction in energy use. This strategy was also used at Paulina’s
complex, and it definitely brought out her competitive streak. For me, the competition was what motivated
me, because seeing your apartment number and telling you that you are doing at the average,
but you are not the best, was like, Why? I’m doing everything you are telling me
to do. I always wanted the gold star, because it
was like, “Oh, my god, I want to be like the less consumption of energy in the whole
building.” And psychology studies have proved this. We are social creatures, and as individualistic
as we can be, turns out we do care about how we compare to others. And yes, we do like to be the best. Some people don’t want to say, Oh, I'm like
the average. No, my usage is different and I want to be
able to act on it. And people can act on it because with these
meters, they can now see their exact impact. A company called Opower is playing with this
idea of social competition. They work with over 100 utility companies
to provide personalized energy reports to millions of customers around the world. Now consumers can not only see their energy
use but how it compares to their neighbors’. Like the UCLA study found, this subtle social
pressure encourages consumers to save energy. It’s been so effective that in 2016, Opower
was able to generate the equivalent of two terawatt-hours of electricity savings. That’s enough to power every home in Miami
for more than a year. And they’re not alone. Even large companies are tapping into behavioral
science to move the dial. Virgin Atlantic Airways gave a select group
of pilots feedback on their fuel use. Over the course of a year, they collectively
saved over 6,800 tons of fuel by making some simple changes:
Adjusting their altitudes, routes, and speed reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by
over 21,000 tons. These behavioral “nudges” do seem to be
advancing how we as a society deal with some pretty complicated climate change issues,
but it turns out we’re just getting started. There is no “quick fix.” We need people changing their companies, changing
their business models, changing the products and services they provide. This is about broader-scale change. And part of this change includes embracing
what makes us human. That it can’t just be a guilt trip about
dying polar bears or driving around in gas guzzlers. We need to talk about our wins, as well — like
how we’re making progress, really being aware of our energy use, and taking advantage
of that competitive spirit we all have in order to really move us from a state of apathy
to action. Global warming is by far the biggest issue
of our time. Climate Lab is a new series from Vox and the
University of California, and we’ll be exploring some surprising ways we can tackle this problem. If you want to learn more, head to climate.universityofcalifornia.edu.

**Transcript**:
When it comes to buying stuff, I’ve often
wondered how did I live without online shopping? I mean literally today anything I want is
available to me 24/7. I can buy anything anytime. In fact 79% of Americans shop online. This happens when they’re laying in bed,
while they’re out with friends having a drink. It turns out actually one in five us shop
online while we’re using the bathroom. All this stuff we’re buying magically appears
on our doorstep. But what effect does all this shopping have
on the planet? Delivery services ship a lot more packages
now because of online shopping. Since 2009 US Postal Service deliveries increased
by 65%. And during the holidays, UPS deliveries have
increased by 260 million packages since 2010. Now for the most part, if you compare online
shopping with driving to the store, online shopping has a smaller carbon footprint. But there’s a catch. It's only better for the environment if you
don't get rushed delivery. Most of us, including me, are choosing faster
delivery like two day shipping because most of the time it's free. Why wouldn’t we want it right away? But it isn’t just a time difference, it’s
an environmental difference. All these faster deliveries mean more trucks
on the road and that’s causing more greenhouse gases. And that means more global warming. When we choose two-day shipping, deliveries
often come in multiple packages. Let’s say I buy some dish soap and a pair
of socks. The shipping warehouse near me might be out
of dish soap, so they fly some in from another state. Meanwhile, those socks, they’re getting
sent to me on a separate truck. Also, the company is trying to get it to me
quickly, so trucks are often sent out only half full -- If there was more flexibility
in timing, they could fill them up all the way. If you know you have five-day delivery window,
you can wait from all the products to come in from different sources, consolidate the
shipment, and send it. And now you can wait for many customers’
orders to come in and consolidate that into, let’s say, a full truckload. This is Miguel Jaller. He studies sustainable transportation at the
University of California, Davis. By picking the longer delivery window, I’m
giving the company more time to find the most efficient way to get a product to me. Another problem is with returns. So one of the things that companies made is
offering this reliable and fast and almost free return option. So now as a customer, I can actually try the
product, even if I don’t have any store to go to, because if I don’t like it or
it doesn’t fit, I can actually return it at no cost. So like with buying clothes, if I shop online
and pick the ‘try before you buy’ option, it would be like saying a delivery truck is
driving back and forth just to find me the right stuff. So what are companies trying to do? When you think of the future of online shipping,
you might imagine drones and driverless cars. But today’s solutions are more about keeping
traffic moving along, like with wifi traffic lights that let truckers know ahead of time
when the light will turn red. This cuts down on idling at the light and
wasting fuel. We’re now starting to transmit the timing
of those traffic lights, in anticipation for that, they might want to speed up a little
bit or slow down or do these certain little velocity changes so that they increase their
chances of getting through that light. This is Matt Barth at the University of California,
Riverside. He’s looking at ways trucks can reduce their
transit footprint. You can essentially smooth out your patterns
of travel. And when you smooth out your travel patterns,
you get those fuel-economy benefits. Cities like San Jose and Las Vegas are already
testing out this traffic light technology. You can save 15 to 20 percent fuel just by
doing those type of activities. And on the highway, trucks are now starting
to talk to each other -- it’s called truck platooning. You can think of it like cruise control except
its transmitting the truck’s speed to the other vehicles following behind. This lets all the trucks drive in unison at
the same speed close behind each other. What they’re doing is trying to reduce the
drag. The narrow gaps they create between each other
shields the trucks that are following from wind resistance. And so there’s been a number of experiments
worldwide that have shown, you know, you can get 10 to 15, 20 percent energy savings, fuel
savings by doing that type of platooning. Now delivery companies have been tackling
fuel use and emissions for decades. Take UPS. Since the 1970s they’ve encouraged drivers
to eliminate left hand turns, reducing their emissions by 100,000 metric tons. That’s like taking 21,000 cars off the road. So there are ways companies can shrink their
carbon footprint, but what if they were better about changing customer behavior – like
getting us to be conscious about how we shop online? I’ve always picked that 2 day option because
to be honest never really thought about it, but what if companies offered a green option? So if you just check a box they would just
ship stuff to you in the most energy efficient way possible. Sure, maybe it takes a little bit longer,
but that’s something I’d actually be willing to do. I mean every now and again, I might need something
right away. But I probably don’t need to overnight a
delivery of socks to my front door. You probably do a lot of your online shopping
with your smartphone. Well watch our other episode to see what kind
of impact these devices have on our planet.

**Transcript**:
When it comes to buying stuff, I’ve often
wondered how did I live without online shopping? I mean literally today anything I want is
available to me 24/7. I can buy anything anytime. In fact 79% of Americans shop online. This happens when they’re laying in bed,
while they’re out with friends having a drink. It turns out actually one in five us shop
online while we’re using the bathroom. All this stuff we’re buying magically appears
on our doorstep. But what effect does all this shopping have
on the planet? Delivery services ship a lot more packages
now because of online shopping. Since 2009 US Postal Service deliveries increased
by 65%. And during the holidays, UPS deliveries have
increased by 260 million packages since 2010. Now for the most part, if you compare online
shopping with driving to the store, online shopping has a smaller carbon footprint. But there’s a catch. It's only better for the environment if you
don't get rushed delivery. Most of us, including me, are choosing faster
delivery like two day shipping because most of the time it's free. Why wouldn’t we want it right away? But it isn’t just a time difference, it’s
an environmental difference. All these faster deliveries mean more trucks
on the road and that’s causing more greenhouse gases. And that means more global warming. When we choose two-day shipping, deliveries
often come in multiple packages. Let’s say I buy some dish soap and a pair
of socks. The shipping warehouse near me might be out
of dish soap, so they fly some in from another state. Meanwhile, those socks, they’re getting
sent to me on a separate truck. Also, the company is trying to get it to me
quickly, so trucks are often sent out only half full -- If there was more flexibility
in timing, they could fill them up all the way. If you know you have five-day delivery window,
you can wait from all the products to come in from different sources, consolidate the
shipment, and send it. And now you can wait for many customers’
orders to come in and consolidate that into, let’s say, a full truckload. This is Miguel Jaller. He studies sustainable transportation at the
University of California, Davis. By picking the longer delivery window, I’m
giving the company more time to find the most efficient way to get a product to me. Another problem is with returns. So one of the things that companies made is

driving back and forth just to find me the right stuff. So what are companies trying to do? When you think of the future of online shipping,
you might imagine drones and driverless cars. But today’s solutions are more about keeping
traffic moving along, like with wifi traffic lights that let truckers know ahead of time
when the light will turn red. This cuts down on idling at the light and
wasting fuel. We’re now starting to transmit the timing
of those traffic lights, in anticipation for that, they might want to speed up a little
bit or slow down or do these certain little velocity changes so that they increase their

Correct Option: D

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.8000 (The generated question is related to the thawing process of the wood frog, but it's broader in scope, asking about the time it takes for the frog to come back to life, rather than specifically focusing on the heart starting to beat.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.5000 (The correct answer option in the generated question contains the correct information about the heart restarting within 30 minutes, but it's combined with additional information about the frog being fully recovered within 2 days, which isn't directly comparable to the ground truth answer.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.6000 (The distractors in the generated question are plausible but lack specificity and direct relation to the heart starting to beat, making them less effective at testing the specific knowledge.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (The generated question and options are clear and understandable, but the correct answer option could be more concise.)
- Total Score: 0.7000
