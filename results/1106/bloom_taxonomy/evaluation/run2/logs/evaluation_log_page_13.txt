**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health 
and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 9 does not directly address the question of how opioid maintenance programs attempt to bring people back to a drug-free lifestyle, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of opioid maintenance programs, I would select Question 9, but with the understanding that it does not fully capture the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not ask about the position of the "th" sound in the word "thunder," it does ask to identify a word that contains the /th/ sound, and "thunder" is one of the options. The other generated MCQs do not specifically address the "th" sound in the word "thunder" or its position.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the most similar in terms of content, as it deals with the "ch" digraph sound. However, the question intent is different, as the ground truth MCQ asks to identify a word that does not use the "ch" digraph, while Question 4 asks about the sound made by the letters "c" and "h" when combined.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks to identify a word that does not use the "ch" digraph, with options including words that use the "ch" digraph and one that does not. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the sound made by the "ph" digraph, while Question 5 asks about the digraph sound in the word "phone", which contains the "ph" digraph.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as they do not ask about the "ph" digraph making the same sound as another letter.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking the test-taker to fill in the blank with the correct digraph to form a real word ("whale"). The correct answer is the /wh/ sound.

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. However, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more similar question is not present, but Question 7 is about the /wh/ sound. However, it does not have the same format as the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the options, Question 3 has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, but it is asking about the /th/ sound.

However, another question (not present in the given list) could be more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the given options, the most similar question would be one that has the same format and is asking about a similar topic. 

In this case, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ, even though it's not asking about the /wh/ sound. However, another question that is asking about the /wh/ sound and has the same format (fill in the blank) could be more similar.

Since there isn't a more similar question, I will choose Question 3's index as the most similar generated MCQ.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 3

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about the contraction of "is not" to "isn't". The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which is about the relationship between the phrases "I am" and "I'm" in the transcript. Both questions deal with the concept of contractions in English grammar.

However, an even more similar generated MCQ is Question 4, which is about the difference between "where is" and "where's" in the given transcript. This question also deals with contractions, and the options provided are similar in structure to the ground truth MCQ.

But the most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 7's analog, if it existed for "is not" instead of "I am". Unfortunately, that question doesn't exist among the options. So we'll go with the closest alternative.

The closest alternative is indeed Question 7. However, another question that is very similar in structure to the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

However, another generated MCQ, Question 7's analog for "does not" instead of "I am" exists: it is not present, but if it did, it would be very similar to question 7. However, another question that is very similar in structure to the ground truth MCQ is indeed Question 7's direct analog for "does not" - and that is not present. However, Question 7's analog for "does not" is very similar to Question 7 itself, and question 7's analog for "does not" would be similar to Question 4's direct analog for "does not" - which is not present but would be similar to Question 4 itself. And that similar question is indeed Question 4 itself, but another similar question to the ground truth is indeed Question 7 itself.

However, if we had to choose the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ between Question 4 and Question 7, it would be more accurate to say that the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is indeed Question 7 itself.

The final answer is: $\boxed{7}$.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

This is because both the ground truth MCQ and Question 1 are asking about the correct punctuation mark to use at the end of a sentence. The ground truth MCQ provides a specific sentence ("My car is red") and asks which punctuation mark is correct, while Question 1 asks more generally about the punctuation mark used to indicate the end of a complete thought. However, the intent and content of the two questions are similar, and the correct answer in both cases is a period (B).

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 1.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the correct punctuation mark for a sentence that is a question ("What is your name"). The correct answer is a question mark (?).

Among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: "What is the primary function of a question mark in a sentence?" Options: A. To indicate strong feelings, B. To list items, C. To pause between thoughts, D. To ask a question. Correct Option: D.

However, an even more similar match is Question 1's option C "What punctuation mark is used to indicate the end of a complete thought?" is not as similar as it is asking about the end of a complete thought, not specifically about a question, but among the options provided, there is an option for a question mark.

But the best match is actually none of the above. However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest.

So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

This question is about the characteristics of lipids, specifically the effect that helps them stick together, which is the hydrophobic effect. Although it does not cover all the characteristics mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about multiple characteristics of lipids (pin-shaped, heads attracted to water, tails repulsed by water, forming a shell in water, and sticking loosely together). If a new MCQ were to be generated that asks about these specific characteristics, it would be a closer match. 

But among the provided options, Question 6 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can infer that the closest match would be a question that mentions the composition of hand sanitizer.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the high concentrations of alcohols in hand sanitizer, specifically mentioning methanol, isopropanol, and ethanol. Among the generated MCQs, none directly address this topic. However, Question 4 mentions hand sanitizer, and Question 3 discusses using hand sanitizer as an alternative for hand hygiene.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that Question 3 or Question 4 might be related, but they do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, since I must provide an index, I will choose the index of the question that is most closely related to hand sanitizer.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the WILD technique and its effects on the body and mind during sleep, while the generated MCQs cover various topics in psychology, statistics, and research methods.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of sleep and consciousness, I would choose Question 8: "A researcher wants to study the relationship between sleep deprivation and cognitive function. What research design would be most suitable for this study?" This question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ, but it is the closest in terms of topic relevance.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

However, the options provided in Question 2 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the effect of removing the "super e" from the word "game". 

Among the provided options, Question 2 is the closest match, but it's not an exact match.

A closer match can be found in the fact that Question 2 talks about the word "GAME" which is the same word used in the ground truth MCQ. But if we consider the content of all the generated MCQs, we can find a pattern in the way the questions are framed and the options provided.

Considering this, we can say that Question 2 and Question 5 provide relevant information about the effect of the "super e" on the word "game". Question 5 provides information about the general rule for finding a "super e" in a word which can be applied to the word "game" to understand its effect.

However, if we were to choose one of the generated MCQs that best matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be Question 2.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ focuses on the phonetic similarity between "Fish" and "wish" and asks about the position of the "SH" sound in the words. Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most relevant, as it discusses the difference between two types of fish mentioned in the transcript, including the fact that one is short. However, it does not directly address the phonetic aspect.

Although there isn't a direct match, I would recommend Question 5 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it deals with the characteristics of the fish mentioned in the transcript, which is related to the context of the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the correct way to write a sentence, specifically focusing on capitalization. Among the generated MCQs, the most similar one is Question 7: "What is the relationship between the size of a letter and its use at the beginning of a sentence?" 

However, an even more similar question is Question 1: "What is the first characteristic of a sentence mentioned in the transcript?" as it also deals with the concept of how a sentence should be written, specifically starting with a capital letter.

But the most similar question in terms of intent and content would be Question 10: "What is the common characteristic among the sentences 'My dog is great', 'Do you like bugs', and 'There's a monster'?" because it is asking about the correct structure of a sentence, which includes starting with a capital letter.

However, none of these questions are asking to identify the correctly written sentence among options, but rather about the characteristics of a sentence.

Considering all the aspects, the closest match would be Question 7, as it deals with the size of the letter at the beginning of the sentence, which is related to the correct way of writing a sentence as shown in the options of the ground truth MCQ.

Can you guess what you’re looking at? Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.

**Transcript**:
Can you guess what you’re looking at? Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.

Our perception of the world around us is
strongly linked to our vision. But how do you know what you're seeing
is real? Can you really trust your eyes? Take for example these two grey
rectangular columns, both of which are different shades of
grey. Or are they? It turns out that they're the exact same. And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there your eyes refused to see them as the
same. Introducing colors produces the same result. I promise no trick photography or
editing effects have been applied. In fact, if you look up the Munker-White
illusion, you'll come across many more examples. Examine them in Photoshop and you can
see that the colors are the exact same. A similar effect can be seen with this
checkerboard illusion. Tile A clearly seems darker than tile B.
But you know better by now, right? Even though your eyes can't see it, you
know when I removed the surrounding imagery the tiles will be the same color. So
what's going on here? The truth is that scientists don't fully
understand this phenomenon, and there are many complex biological
and neurological factors taking place. Ultimately, our brains judge color and
brightness in context. In other words, our brains compare the
surrounding environment in order to create our perception. The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case, is not to provide us with an absolute
color or physical property of our external reality, but to interpret what we see as
efficiently as possible in order to interact with the
environment most appropriately. The tile illusion takes advantage of this
phenomenon. Our brains know that shadows make
objects look darker, as a result the brain compensates by
interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it
becomes obvious. Once again, the darkness of the background has
affected our perception of the bar's color. Our perception is relative. So do you still trust your eyes? Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and Twitter and subscribe for more weekly science
videos.

too, but I love reading comic books and seeing what my favorite superheroes are up to. What about you? Do you like reading comic books? Maybe you like playing video games and you
have to read what is on the screen, to pass on to the next level. No, maybe you like going on the internet and
playing games, or talking to people. Well whether you know it or not you are reading. But what if you weren't allowed to read? I know that sounds like a silly question,
but what if it were against the law for you to read? Well in American history during slavery African
Americans were not allowed to read. It was against the law for slaves to read,
or even have someone teach them how to read. This is where the next person in African American
history I want to talk about stood up as a leader and an abolitionist. An abolitionist is someone who wanted slavery
to be stopped, and they spoke out against people who used African Americans as slaves. Right now that person I want to talk to you
about is one of the most famous African American abolitionists, by the name of Frederick Douglass. Known as the most recognized African American
leader before the civil war, Frederick Douglass was born a slave. He never knew his father, and was separated
from his mother earlier in life. This is where as a slave he moved from plantation
to plantation, until one slave owner’s wife helped him learn the basics of reading. Now like I said before at that time teaching
slaves to read was against the law, and when her husband found out he stopped her from
teaching Frederick. Although he didn't have a teacher Frederick
was still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and
learning how to read. He watched other white children who learned
in school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also
taught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,
because he did not want other slaves to learn reading like Frederick did. Frederick eventually stood up to the beatings,
and one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other
people who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these
people were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking
in front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick
impressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his
life. The biography told about everything he went
through in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but
this put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come
to the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made
enough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during
the civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had
respect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today
is Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama
and he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another
famous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice
to President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons
to African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick
spoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought
why didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t
do. It was not acceptable to just go out and live
a free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against
slavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always
be one of the greats in African American History. Frederick Douglass for Kids(Cartoon Biography)

McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she
may be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would
not be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they
stayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa
to see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their
farm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans
and her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair
either. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students
were not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school
in the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who
was a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't
called African American. They were called, "Colored." She later got her high school degree and became
involved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do
something in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in
the United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the
local buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and
African Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then
leave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign
marked, "Coloreds." On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver
to move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said
Rosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had
her arrested. She was later convicted for not following
the laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked
the Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans
coming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when
many buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,
1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be
one that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward
trying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the
age of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten
and I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is asking about two-letter combinations that make the same sound, which is not related to the content of the transcript or any of the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the presence of similar sounds or words, I would choose Question 4: What sound do the cowboy and his friends hear while searching for a cow? Options: A. A bird chirping, B. A rattlesnake, C. A cow mooing, D. A horse neighing. This question mentions sounds, but it's still not related to the two-letter combinations that make the same sound.

Since there's no direct match, I'll provide the index of the generated MCQ that I considered, but please note that it's not a close match:

Index: 4

Keep in mind that the generated MCQs are focused on the content of the transcript, whereas the ground truth MCQ seems to be a language-related question that doesn't match the topic of the transcript.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent or theme.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a word that rhymes with "found" from the video, and the correct option is "sound." While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 4 mentions a sound (rattlesnake) that the cowboy and his friends hear while searching for a cow.

Although Question 4 is not a perfect match, it is the closest in terms of theme and intent. Therefore, I would suggest:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options, it shares a similar intent and content. Both questions are related to sentence starters, specifically "where" sentence starters in the ground truth MCQ and sentence starters that describe an event at a specific location in Question 3.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them precisely match the ground truth MCQ. But if we had to choose one, Question 3 would be the closest match.

But since it's not an exact match let's try to find another option that could be a match
Another possible match could be Question 5 Options: A. Using a subject and verb, B. Using an ing phrase or an ed word, C. Using an l y word, D. All of the above it does contain some of the location words mentioned in the passage that could be used as "where" sentence starters but it's more focused on the comma usage.

However the passage does mention the following 
"you can start a sentence with words that tell you where something is happening on the beach there was a shipwreck or it could be beside the beach by the beach near the beach"

With that in mind I would say that the best match is actually Question 3

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not specifically ask about the rule to follow when starting a sentence with a subject, its options and correct answer (B. To tell what the subject is doing) closely match the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the rule to follow when using the first strategy of starting a sentence with a subject. 

However, a more precise match can be found in Question 1, which mentions "putting the subject first and the verb second" as the correct option. This matches the ground truth MCQ's correct option, "You must follow your subject with a verb."

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and one of the options (using a comma) align with the ground truth MCQ. Question 5 asks about sentence starters that require a comma before completing the sentence, and one of the correct options (D) includes "Using an ing phrase or an ed word" and also "Using an l y word", but the most relevant detail is that option D also implies that using a "when phrase" would also require a comma as seen in the transcript ("after school, we played computer games" and "before school, don't forget to use a comma").

However, there isn't a perfect match in the options provided for the generated MCQs. But among the available choices, Question 5 has the closest relation to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health 
and Human Services operates a helpline: 800-662-4357 and a database of more than 14,000 
substance abuse facilities in the US: www.hhs.gov/opioids

from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything

larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer 
to get rid of all the extra noradrenaline receptors 
it made. That means there’s a period of time when the body is too sensitive 
to noradrenaline. This oversensitivity causes 
withdrawal symptoms, including muscle aches, stomach pains, 
fever, and vomiting. Though temporary, opioid withdrawal 
can be incredibly debilitating. In serious cases, someone in withdrawal 
can be violently ill for days or even weeks. People who are addicted to opioids 
aren't necessarily using the drugs to get high anymore, 
but rather to avoid being sick. Many risk losing wages or even jobs 
while in withdrawal, or may not have anyone to take care 
of them during withdrawal. If someone goes back 
to using opioids later, they can be at particularly high risk 
for overdose, because what would have been a standard 
dose while their tolerance was high, can now be lethal. Since 1980, accidental deaths 
from opioid overdose have grown exponentially 
in the United States, and opioid addictions have 
also exploded around the world. While opioid painkiller prescriptions 
are becoming more closely regulated, cases of overdose and addiction 
are still increasing, especially among younger people. Many of the early cases of addiction 
were middle-aged people who became addicted to painkillers 
they had been prescribed, or received from friends 
and family members with prescriptions. Today, young people are often introduced 
to prescription opioid drugs in those ways but move on to heroin or illicit 
synthetic opioids that are cheaper and easier to come by. Beyond tighter regulation 
of opioid painkillers, what can we do to reverse the growing 
rates of addiction and overdose? A drug called naloxone is currently 
our best defense against overdose. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors 
but doesn’t activate them. It blocks other opioids 
from binding to the receptors, and even knocks them off the receptors 
to reverse an overdose. Opioid addiction 
is rarely a stand-alone illness; frequently, people with opioid dependence 
are also struggling with a mental health condition. There are both inpatient 
and outpatient programs that combine medication, health services, 
and psychotherapy. But many of these programs 
are very expensive, and the more affordable options 
can have long waiting lists. They also often require complete 
detoxification from opioids before beginning treatment. Both the withdrawal period and the common 
months-long stay in a facility can be impossible for people who risk 
losing jobs and housing in that timeframe. Opioid maintenance programs aim 
to address some of these obstacles and eliminate opioid abuse 
using a combination of medication and behavior therapy. These programs avoid withdrawal symptoms 
with drugs that bind to opioid receptors 
but don’t have the psychoactive effects of painkillers, heroin, 
and other commonly abused opioids. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary opioid maintenance 
drugs available today, but doctors need a special waiver 
to prescribe them— even though no specific training 
or certification is required to prescribe 
opioid painkillers. Buprenorphine can be so scarce that there’s even 
a growing black market for it. There’s still a long way to go 
with combating opioid addiction, but there are great resources 
for making sense of the treatment options. If you or someone you know is struggling 
with opioid use in the United States, the Department of Health

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
More than 3,000 years ago, 
a flower began to appear in remedies in Ancient Egyptian medical texts. Across the Mediterranean, 
the ancient Minoans likely found ways to use 
the same plant for its high. Both ancient civilizations 
were on to something— opium, 
an extract of the poppy in question, can both induce pleasure 
and reduce pain. Though opium has remained 
in use ever since, it wasn’t until the 19th century 
that one of its chemical compounds, morphine, was identified 
and isolated for medical use. Morphine, codeine, and other substances 
made directly from the poppy are called opiates. In the 20th century, drug companies 
created a slew of synthetic substances similar to these opiates, including heroin, hydrocodone, 
oxycodone, and fentanyl. Whether synthetic or derived from opium, these compounds 
are collectively known as opioids. Synthetic or natural, legal or illicit, 
opioid drugs are very effective painkillers,
but they are also highly addictive. In the 1980s and 90s, pharmaceutical companies began 
to market opioid painkillers aggressively, actively downplaying 
their addictive potential to both the medical community 
and the public. The number of opioid painkillers 
prescriptions skyrocketed, and so did cases of opioid addiction, 
beginning a crisis that continues today. To understand why opioids 
are so addictive, it helps to trace how these drugs affect 
the human body from the first dose, through repeated use, 
to what happens when long-term use stops. Each of these drugs 
has slightly different chemistry, but all act on the body’s opioid system by
binding to opioid receptors in the brain. The body’s endorphins temper pain signals 
by binding to these receptors, and opioid drugs bind 
much more strongly, for longer. So opioid drugs can manage much more 
severe pain than endorphins can. Opioid receptors also influence everything
from mood to normal bodily functions. With these functions, too, 
opioids’ binding strength and durability mean their effects 
are more pronounced and widespread than those of the body’s 
natural signaling molecules. When a drug binds to opioid receptors, 
it triggers the release of dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure 
and may be responsible for the sense of euphoria 
that characterizes an opioid high. At the same time, opioids suppress 
the release of noradrenaline, which influences wakefulness, breathing, 
digestion, and blood pressure. A therapeutic dose decreases noradrenaline
enough to cause side effects like constipation. At higher doses opioids can decrease heart
and breathing rates to dangerous levels, causing loss of consciousness 
and even death. Over time, the body starts 
to develop a tolerance for opioids. It may decrease its number 
of opioid receptors, or the receptors may become 
less responsive. To experience the same release of dopamine
and resulting mood effects as before, people have to take 
larger and larger doses— a cycle that leads to physical dependence 
and addiction. As people take more opioids 
to compensate for tolerance, noradrenaline levels 
become lower and lower, to a point that could impact 
basic bodily functions. The body compensates by increasing 
its number of noradrenaline receptors so it can detect much smaller amounts 
of noradrenaline. This increased sensitivity 
to noradrenaline allows the body 
to continue functioning normally— in fact, it becomes dependent on opioids 
to maintain the new balance. When someone who is physically dependent 
on opioids stops taking them abruptly, that balance is disrupted. Noradrenaline levels can increase 
within a day of ceasing opioid use. But the body takes much longer

**Transcript**:
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least 
20 seconds of hand-washing because of the intricate landscape 
that is your hand. Soap and sanitizer need to get everywhere,
including your palms, fingertips, the outsides of your hands, 
and between your fingers, to protect you properly. And when it comes to a 
coronavirus outbreak, doctors recommend washing your hands
with soap and water whenever possible. Even though both approaches are similarly 
effective at killing the virus, soap and water has two benefits: first it washes away any dirt which 
could otherwise hide virus particles. But more importantly, it’s simply easier to fully cover 
your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds. Of course, hand sanitizer 
is more convenient to use on the go. In the absence of a sink, use 
the sanitizer as thoroughly as possible and rub your hands together 
until they’re dry. Unfortunately, there are billions 
of people who don’t have access 
to clean drinking water, which is a huge problem at any time
but especially during an outbreak. Researchers and aid groups are working to
provide solutions for these communities. One example is a device that uses salt,
water, and a car battery to make chlorinated water 
that kills harmful pathogens and is safe for hand-washing. So wherever possible, soap and water 
are recommended for a coronavirus, but does that mean it's best 
for every viral outbreak? Not necessarily. Many common colds are caused 
by rhinoviruses that have a geometric protein structure
called a capsid instead of a lipid membrane. The capsid doesn't have nearly 
as many weak points where soap amphiphiles can pry it apart, so it takes longer 
for soap to be effective. However some of its surface 
proteins are still vulnerable to the destabilizing effect 
of hand sanitizer. In this and similar cases, hand sanitizer
may be more effective, especially if you then wash 
your hands to remove residual particles. The best way to know 
which to use for any given outbreak is to do what's best 
for all things illness-related: follow the advice 
of accredited medical professionals.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your hands, up close, 
are anything but smooth. With peaks and valleys, folds and rifts, there are plenty of hiding places 
for a virus to stick. If you then touch your face, 
the virus can infect you. But there are two extraordinarily simple 
ways you can keep that from happening: soap and water, and hand sanitizer. So which is better? The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of many viruses whose protective
outer surface is made of a lipid bilayer. These lipids are pin shaped molecules 
whose heads are attracted to water, and tails are repulsed by it. So in water-rich environments, 
lipids naturally form a shell like this, with the heads outside 
and the tails inside. Their shared reaction to water makes 
the lipids stick loosely together— this is called the hydrophobic effect. This outer structure helps the molecular
machinery of the virus break through cellular membranes 
and hijack our cells. But it has thousands upon thousands 
of weak points where the right molecules 
could pry it apart. And this is where soap comes in. A single drop of any brand of soap 
contains quadrillions of molecules called amphiphiles, 
which resemble biological lipids. Their tails, which are similarly repulsed
by water, compete for space with the lipids 
that make up the virus’s shell. But they’re just different enough to break
up the regularity of the virus’s membrane, making the whole thing come crashing down. Those amphiphiles then form bubbles 
of their own around particles including the virus’s RNA and proteins. Apply water, and you’ll wash 
that whole bubble away. Hand sanitizers work less like a crowbar, 
and more like an earthquake. When you surround a coronavirus 
with water, the hydrophobic effect gives the bonds 
within the membrane their strength. That same effect also holds 
the big proteins that form coronavirus’s spikes in place and in the shape that enables 
them to infect your cells. If you dry the virus out in air, 
it keeps its stability. But now surround it 
with a high concentration of an alcohol, like the ethanol or isopropanol found 
in most hand-sanitizers. This makes the hydrophobic 
effect disappear, and gives the molecules room 
to move around. The overall effect is like removing all 
of the nails and mortar from a house and then hitting it with an earthquake. The cell’s membrane collapses 
and those spike proteins crumble. In either method, the actual process 
of destroying the virus happens in just a second or two. But doctors recommend at least

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can you guess what you’re looking at? Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Can you guess what you’re looking at? Is it a fuzzy sock? An overripe banana? 
A moldy tube of toothpaste? In fact, this is the humble sea cucumber, 
and while it might look odd, its daily toil paves the way 
for entire ecosystems to thrive. Sea cucumbers are members 
of the phylum Echinodermata, along with sea urchins, starfish 
and other radially symmetrical, “spiny-skinned” marine invertebrates. Some sea cucumbers have feathery tentacles
flowing from their mouths, some are puffed like bloated balloons, and others simply look like 
Headless Chicken Monsters— the actual name given 
to a rare deep-sea species. But they are generally characterized 
by their long, cylindrical shape. A sea cucumber is essentially a brainless,
fleshy form surrounding a digestive tract, bookended by a mouth and an anus. Adhesive tube feet 
run the length of their bodies and allow them to scoot along 
the seafloor. Specialized tube feet can be used 
for feeding and respiration, though many sea cucumbers actually 
breathe through their anuses. Rhythmically contracting and relaxing 
their muscles, they draw water in and out 
over an internal lung-like structure called a respiratory tree
that extracts oxygen from seawater. Certain species of crabs and pearlfish take advantage of this 
rhythmic action and, once the sea cucumber’s anus is dilated,
they shimmy in and take shelter. The rear end of a single sea cucumber can 
harbor up to fifteen pearlfish at a time. However, it seems that not all 
sea cucumbers put up with this intrusive behavior. Some species are equipped with five teeth
around their anus, suggesting that they may have taken
an evolutionary stand against unwanted guests. But even sea cucumbers 
that lack anal teeth are outfitted with tools 
to defend themselves. They evade threats 
and launch counter-attacks using their mutable collagenous tissue, 
or MCT. This gel-like tissue contains 
bundles of collagen, called “fibrils.” Proteins can interact with these fibrils 
to slide them together, stiffening the tissue, or apart, 
softening it. This versatile tissue has many advantages: it aids in efficient locomotion, enables sea cucumbers 
to fit into small spaces, and allows them to reproduce 
asexually by splitting apart. But MCT’s most explosive application 
is employed when a predator attacks. By loosening the attachments 
of internal tissues then quickly softening 
and contracting their muscles, many species are capable of shooting 
a wide range of organs out of their anuses. This act is called “evisceration” and it’s a surprisingly effective 
defense mechanism. In addition to startling 
and distracting predators, the innards of some sea cucumber 
species are sticky and toxic. Evisceration may seem drastic, but sea cucumbers are able to regenerate 
what they’ve lost to their gut reaction in just a few weeks’ time. Aside from the few species 
that have evolved to swim and those that feed without moving, many of these cumbersome creatures 
pass their time grazing the seabed. Sea cucumbers are found everywhere 
from shallow shores to abyssal trenches 6,000 meters 
below sea level. On the deep sea floor, they comprise 
the majority of animal biomass, reaching up to 95% in some areas. As these sausage-shaped wonders 
trudge along, they vacuum up sand, digest the organic matter it contains, 
and excrete the byproduct. In this process, sea cucumbers clean 
and oxygenate the seafloor by breaking down detritus 
and recycling nutrients. This creates the conditions for sea grass 
beds and shellfish to thrive. Sea cucumber excretions can also aid 
in coral formation and may play a role in buffering marine 
environments from ocean acidification. As the ocean’s vacuum cleaners, 
they are very good at their job: about half of the sandy seafloor is thought to have passed through 
the digestive tract of a sea cucumber. So next time you’re rejoicing 
in the feeling of sand crunching between your toes, 
consider this: those very grains of sand might have, 
at one point or another, been excreted by a pickle 
that breathes through its butt.

Our perception of the world around us is
strongly linked to our vision. But how do you know what you're seeing
is real? Can you really trust your eyes? Take for example these two grey
rectangular columns, both of which are different shades of
grey. Or are they? It turns out that they're the exact same. And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there your eyes refused to see them as the
same. Introducing colors produces the same result. I promise no trick photography or
editing effects have been applied. In fact, if you look up the Munker-White
illusion, you'll come across many more examples. Examine them in Photoshop and you can
see that the colors are the exact same. A similar effect can be seen with this
checkerboard illusion. Tile A clearly seems darker than tile B.
But you know better by now, right? Even though your eyes can't see it, you
know when I removed the surrounding imagery the tiles will be the same color. So
what's going on here? The truth is that scientists don't fully
understand this phenomenon, and there are many complex biological
and neurological factors taking place. Ultimately, our brains judge color and
brightness in context. In other words, our brains compare the
surrounding environment in order to create our perception. The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case, is not to provide us with an absolute
color or physical property of our external reality, but to interpret what we see as
efficiently as possible in order to interact with the
environment most appropriately. The tile illusion takes advantage of this
phenomenon. Our brains know that shadows make
objects look darker, as a result the brain compensates by
interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it
becomes obvious. Once again, the darkness of the background has
affected our perception of the bar's color. Our perception is relative. So do you still trust your eyes? Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and Twitter and subscribe for more weekly science

interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it
becomes obvious. Once again, the darkness of the background has
affected our perception of the bar's color. Our perception is relative. So do you still trust your eyes? Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments, or on Facebook and Twitter and subscribe for more weekly science

**Transcript**:
Our perception of the world around us is
strongly linked to our vision. But how do you know what you're seeing
is real? Can you really trust your eyes? Take for example these two grey
rectangular columns, both of which are different shades of
grey. Or are they? It turns out that they're the exact same. And yet, even after knowing the illusion is there your eyes refused to see them as the
same. Introducing colors produces the same result. I promise no trick photography or
editing effects have been applied. In fact, if you look up the Munker-White
illusion, you'll come across many more examples. Examine them in Photoshop and you can
see that the colors are the exact same. A similar effect can be seen with this
checkerboard illusion. Tile A clearly seems darker than tile B.
But you know better by now, right? Even though your eyes can't see it, you
know when I removed the surrounding imagery the tiles will be the same color. So
what's going on here? The truth is that scientists don't fully
understand this phenomenon, and there are many complex biological
and neurological factors taking place. Ultimately, our brains judge color and
brightness in context. In other words, our brains compare the
surrounding environment in order to create our perception. The purpose of our senses or eyes in this case, is not to provide us with an absolute
color or physical property of our external reality, but to interpret what we see as
efficiently as possible in order to interact with the
environment most appropriately. The tile illusion takes advantage of this
phenomenon. Our brains know that shadows make
objects look darker, as a result the brain compensates by
interpreting the tile as being lighter than it appears until we take the shadow away. Perhaps, the most blatant example is this gradient. The middle bar is simply one color. Remove the background gradient and it

It's time for learning with fun facts about
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for kids. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American
Baptist minister, activist humanitarian, and also known for being the leader of the African-American
Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta,
Georgia on January 15th in 1929. Now the world knows him today as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr, but his name wasn't always Martin. He was actually born and given the name Michael,
by his father, but that all changed during a trip to Germany where the theologian Martin
Luther impressed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s father so much that he changed his name and
his son’s name too. Now when it came to education Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was very smart. That's right when he was a kid he literally
skipped two grades the 9th and the 11th to enter Morehouse College at the young age of
15 in 1944. Later on Dr. King entered Boston University. There he completed his school work in 1953
earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. Also while he was there he met his love Coretta
Scott. That's right Coretta Scott was a young singer
from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. They later got married in 1953. Not long thereafter he got involved in the
civil rights movement taking part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, after Rosa Parks had been arrested
by not going to the back of the bus after the bus driver told her she couldn’t sit
at the front. Of course many know Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr from taking part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, where his world famous,
“I have a dream,” speech set a fire to the civil rights movement there can still
be echoed today of people wanting freedom and wanting to be treated equally. From there his name only group and in 1964
dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. Sadly Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life was
cut short being assassinated on April 4 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the
balcony of the Lorraine Motel. Although the nation was sad the voice and
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would still ring loud today. The hard work that he did during the civil
rights movement would soon be listened to and that's when the Civil Rights Act of 1968
was passed by Congress and although many celebrated his birthday around the country in multiple
cities at the White House Rose Garden on November 2nd 1983 President Ronald Reagan signed a
bill creating a federal holiday to honor Dr. King's works and those were fun facts about
dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

**Transcript**:
It's time for learning with fun facts about
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for kids. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was an American
Baptist minister, activist humanitarian, and also known for being the leader of the African-American
Civil Rights Movement. Dr. Martin Luther King was born in Atlanta,
Georgia on January 15th in 1929. Now the world knows him today as Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr, but his name wasn't always Martin. He was actually born and given the name Michael,
by his father, but that all changed during a trip to Germany where the theologian Martin
Luther impressed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s father so much that he changed his name and
his son’s name too. Now when it came to education Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was very smart. That's right when he was a kid he literally
skipped two grades the 9th and the 11th to enter Morehouse College at the young age of
15 in 1944. Later on Dr. King entered Boston University. There he completed his school work in 1953
earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later. Also while he was there he met his love Coretta
Scott. That's right Coretta Scott was a young singer
from Alabama who was studying at the New England Conservatory of Music. They later got married in 1953. Not long thereafter he got involved in the
civil rights movement taking part in the Montgomery Bus Boycott, after Rosa Parks had been arrested
by not going to the back of the bus after the bus driver told her she couldn’t sit
at the front. Of course many know Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr from taking part in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, where his world famous,
“I have a dream,” speech set a fire to the civil rights movement there can still
be echoed today of people wanting freedom and wanting to be treated equally. From there his name only group and in 1964
dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the Nobel
Peace Prize. Sadly Dr. Martin Luther King Jr's life was
cut short being assassinated on April 4 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee, while standing on the
balcony of the Lorraine Motel. Although the nation was sad the voice and
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. would still ring loud today. The hard work that he did during the civil
rights movement would soon be listened to and that's when the Civil Rights Act of 1968
was passed by Congress and although many celebrated his birthday around the country in multiple
cities at the White House Rose Garden on November 2nd 1983 President Ronald Reagan signed a
bill creating a federal holiday to honor Dr. King's works and those were fun facts about
dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

One thing I like to do every week is read
my favorite comic books. Now on't get me wrong, I like to read books
too, but I love reading comic books and seeing what my favorite superheroes are up to. What about you? Do you like reading comic books? Maybe you like playing video games and you
have to read what is on the screen, to pass on to the next level. No, maybe you like going on the internet and
playing games, or talking to people. Well whether you know it or not you are reading. But what if you weren't allowed to read? I know that sounds like a silly question,
but what if it were against the law for you to read? Well in American history during slavery African
Americans were not allowed to read. It was against the law for slaves to read,
or even have someone teach them how to read. This is where the next person in African American
history I want to talk about stood up as a leader and an abolitionist. An abolitionist is someone who wanted slavery
to be stopped, and they spoke out against people who used African Americans as slaves. Right now that person I want to talk to you
about is one of the most famous African American abolitionists, by the name of Frederick Douglass. Known as the most recognized African American
leader before the civil war, Frederick Douglass was born a slave. He never knew his father, and was separated
from his mother earlier in life. This is where as a slave he moved from plantation
to plantation, until one slave owner’s wife helped him learn the basics of reading. Now like I said before at that time teaching
slaves to read was against the law, and when her husband found out he stopped her from
teaching Frederick. Although he didn't have a teacher Frederick
was still smart. Frederick wouldn't be stopped in growing and
learning how to read. He watched other white children who learned
in school, and taught himself how to read later. This got him into trouble because he also
taught other slaves to read. When his master found out he would beat him,
because he did not want other slaves to learn reading like Frederick did. Frederick eventually stood up to the beatings,
and one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other
people who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these
people were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking
in front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick
impressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his
life. The biography told about everything he went
through in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but
this put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come
to the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made
enough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during
the civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had
respect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today
is Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama
and he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another
famous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice
to President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons
to African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick
spoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought
why didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t
do. It was not acceptable to just go out and live
a free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against
slavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always
be one of the greats in African American History. Frederick Douglass for Kids(Cartoon Biography)

and one day borrowed the papers of a free sailor and escaped to the north. When he arrived in the North he found other
people who were against slavery too. Like I talked about in the beginning these
people were called abolitionists. Frederick was really good at talking and speaking
in front of people and when he told the abolitionists about how he was treated as a slave Frederick
impressed them. Frederick later wrote a biography about his
life. The biography told about everything he went
through in life. Many people read Fredrick's biography, but
this put him in danger, because he was afraid that his master from the South would come
to the north and capture him knowing he had escaped. This cost Frederick to escape to Britain. He would return years later once he had made
enough money to purchase his freedom. Upon arriving back Frederick spoke out during
the civil war. When it came to Frederick Douglass he had
respect all the way up to the White House. Think about it like this, the president today
is Barack Obama. Wouldn't it be cool if you could talk to Obama
and he would listen to you? Well Frederick Douglass had the ear of another
famous president who would listen to him. That's right, Frederick Douglass gave advice
to President Abraham Lincoln. Frederick convinced Lincoln to give more weapons
to African Americans to help fight with the Union soldiers in the Civil War. Now being a great leader in history, Frederick
spoke out against the poor treatment of African Americans in the United States. Many looked at Frederick's life and thought
why didn't he just escape slavery and live out his days in peace as a free man. But that wasn’t in the cards for Frederick. This was something that he knew he couldn’t
do. It was not acceptable to just go out and live
a free life while others while others were being treated poorly. So for standing up and speaking out against
slavery and the poor treatment of African Americans, Frederick Douglass will always
be one of the greats in African American History. Frederick Douglass for Kids(Cartoon Biography)

It's time for learning with a fun Rosa Parks
for kids cartoon. Hey history is full of courageous people who
stood up to help us get to where we are today. Right now I want to talk to you about one
of those people named Rosa Parks. Have you ever heard of Rosa Parks? If not that's okay because I am going to give
you a few fun facts about Rosa Parks for kids and her life as a civil rights activist. Starting off Rosa Parks was born Rosa Louise
McCauley on February 4, 1913, in Tuskegee, Alabama. So check this out when Rosa was a kid, she
may be just like you, or a kid you know. At a young age her parents decided they would
not be together anymore and Rosa moved with her mother to Pine Level, Alabama where they
stayed with her grandparents. Living with her grandparents allowed Rosa
to see people do mean things African Americans, but it also showed her how to be strong! Like one day her grandfather protected their
farm from a group of men called the Ku Klux Klan. This group was known for killing African Americans
and her grandfather stood out front protecting their home as the Ku Klux Klan marched by. When it came to school things were not fair
either. As a child the schools Rosa went to were segregated. This meant that African American students
were not allowed to go to school with White Students. Although Rosa enjoyed school, she left school
in the 11th grade to help her sick mom and grandmother. Later in 1929 she married Raymond parks who
was a barber and also a part of the NAACP organization and that the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People. You see back then African America's weren't
called African American. They were called, "Colored." She later got her high school degree and became
involved with the NAACP too as a youth leader. On December 1, 1955, this is when Rosa do
something in history that would spark a change for how African Americans were treated in
the United States of America. During this time in Montgomery, Alabama the
local buses were also segregated. Whites would be in the front of the bus and
African Americans would come to the front of the bus to pay their bus fair but then
leave the bus and go through the back door to sit at the back of the bus with a sign
marked, "Coloreds." On that day Rosa was told by the bus driver
to move so that a white passenger who got on the bus could have her seat. After thinking about what the bus driver said
Rosa was tired of being treated unfairly and refused to move. After refusing to move the bus driver had
her arrested. She was later convicted for not following
the laws. This made a lot of people mad and sparked
the Montgomery Boycott with another major person in African American History, Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr. The Montgomery Boycott saw African Americans
coming together to refuse using the bus to get around town. The boycott lasted several months and when
many buses sat empty the city had to do something. The boycott officially ended on December 20,
1956 after the Supreme Court said they couldn't treat African Americans unfairly. The life and legacy of Rosa Parks will be
one that will be remembered in our hearts and minds as we go forward
trying to create a world that does not judge others on the color of their skin. Rosa parks died on October 24, 2005, at the
age of 92, but although she is gone her resistance to unfair treatment will never be forgotten
and I hope you enjoyed this Rosa Parks Biography for kids.
