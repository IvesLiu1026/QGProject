**Transcript**:
Imagine a police lineup
where ten witnesses are asked to identify a bank robber
they glimpsed fleeing the crime scene. If six of them pick out the same person, there's a good chance 
that's the real culprit, and if all ten make the same choice, you might think the case is rock solid, but you'd be wrong. For most of us, 
this sounds pretty strange. After all, much of our society
relies on majority vote and consensus, whether it's politics, business, or entertainment. So it's natural to think
that more consensus is a good thing. And up until a certain point, 
it usually is. But sometimes, the closer you start to get
to total agreement, the less reliable the result becomes. This is called the paradox of unanimity. The key to understanding 
this apparent paradox is in considering the overall level 
of uncertainty involved in the type of situation 
you're dealing with. If we asked witnesses to identify
the apple in this lineup, for example, we shouldn't be surprised 
by a unanimous verdict. But in cases where we have 
reason to expect some natural variance, we should also expect varied distribution. If you toss a coin one hundred times, you would expect to get heads
somewhere around 50% of the time. But if your results started 
to approach 100% heads, you'd suspect that something was wrong, not with your individual flips, but with the coin itself. Of course, suspect identifications aren't
as random as coin tosses, but they're not as clear cut 
as telling apples from bananas, either. In fact, a 1994 study found 
that up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong 
person out of a lineup, even when many 
are confident in their choice. Memory based on short glimpses
can be unreliable, and we often overestimate 
our own accuracy. Knowing all this, a unanimous identification starts to seem
less like certain guilt, and more like a systemic error, or bias in the lineup. And systemic errors don't just appear
in matters of human judgement. From 1993-2008, the same female DNA was found 
in multiple crime scenes around Europe, incriminating an elusive killer
dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn. But the DNA evidence was so consistent
precisely because it was wrong. It turned out that the cotton swabs
used to collect the DNA samples had all been accidentally contaminated
by a woman working in the swab factory. In other cases, systematic errors arise
through deliberate fraud, like the presidential referendum held
by Saddam Hussein in 2002, which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters
with all 100% supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term. When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually
all that paradoxical. Unanimous agreement 
is still theoretically ideal, especially in cases when you'd expect very
low odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where 
perfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there's probably
some hidden factor affecting the system. Although we may strive for harmony
and consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement
should be naturally expected. And if a perfect result seems too good
to be true, it probably is.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the wording of the question and options are not identical, the intent and content of Question 2 align with the ground truth MCQ. Both questions address the reliability of a unanimous identification of a suspect by witnesses, and both suggest that a systemic error or bias may be present.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 2 do not perfectly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. To make Question 2 more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the options could be revised to include a range of probabilities (e.g., "very likely," "unlikely," etc.) rather than explanations for why a unanimous identification may be less reliable.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: Why might a unanimous identification of a suspect by witnesses be less reliable than expected?**

Although the question phrasing is different, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions deal with the reliability of a unanimous identification of a suspect by witnesses. The ground truth MCQ presents a specific scenario, while the generated MCQ is more general, but both questions aim to assess the test-taker's understanding of the paradox of unanimity in the context of witness identification.

The correct option for the generated MCQ is not explicitly stated, but option C ("Because a unanimous decision may indicate a systemic error or bias in the lineup.") aligns with the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ, which is that a unanimous identification is not necessarily reliable due to potential systemic errors or biases.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is:

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the likelihood of a group being correct when most of them agree on a particular answer.

A possible match could be a generated MCQ that is not present in the list, but if I had to choose from the existing options, I would say that Question 4: Why might a unanimous result in a situation with high uncertainty be suspicious? is the closest in terms of intent, but it does not match the content.

**Transcript**:
Imagine a police lineup
where ten witnesses are asked to identify a bank robber
they glimpsed fleeing the crime scene. If six of them pick out the same person, there's a good chance 
that's the real culprit, and if all ten make the same choice, you might think the case is rock solid, but you'd be wrong. For most of us, 
this sounds pretty strange. After all, much of our society
relies on majority vote and consensus, whether it's politics, business, or entertainment. So it's natural to think
that more consensus is a good thing. And up until a certain point, 
it usually is. But sometimes, the closer you start to get
to total agreement, the less reliable the result becomes. This is called the paradox of unanimity. The key to understanding 
this apparent paradox is in considering the overall level 
of uncertainty involved in the type of situation 
you're dealing with. If we asked witnesses to identify
the apple in this lineup, for example, we shouldn't be surprised 
by a unanimous verdict. But in cases where we have 
reason to expect some natural variance, we should also expect varied distribution. If you toss a coin one hundred times, you would expect to get heads
somewhere around 50% of the time. But if your results started 
to approach 100% heads, you'd suspect that something was wrong, not with your individual flips, but with the coin itself. Of course, suspect identifications aren't
as random as coin tosses, but they're not as clear cut 
as telling apples from bananas, either. In fact, a 1994 study found 
that up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong 
person out of a lineup, even when many 
are confident in their choice. Memory based on short glimpses
can be unreliable, and we often overestimate 
our own accuracy. Knowing all this, a unanimous identification starts to seem
less like certain guilt, and more like a systemic error, or bias in the lineup. And systemic errors don't just appear
in matters of human judgement. From 1993-2008, the same female DNA was found 
in multiple crime scenes around Europe, incriminating an elusive killer
dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn. But the DNA evidence was so consistent
precisely because it was wrong. It turned out that the cotton swabs
used to collect the DNA samples had all been accidentally contaminated
by a woman working in the swab factory. In other cases, systematic errors arise
through deliberate fraud, like the presidential referendum held
by Saddam Hussein in 2002, which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters
with all 100% supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term. When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually
all that paradoxical. Unanimous agreement 
is still theoretically ideal, especially in cases when you'd expect very
low odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where 
perfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there's probably
some hidden factor affecting the system. Although we may strive for harmony
and consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement
should be naturally expected. And if a perfect result seems too good
to be true, it probably is.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What is an example of a situation where a unanimous result might be expected and reliable? Options: A. A coin toss., B. A witness identification., C. A presidential election., D. Identifying an apple in a lineup.**

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with a scenario where a unanimous result is expected and reliable, which is the case with identifying an apple in a lineup. The ground truth MCQ presents a scenario where 100 friends unanimously report that there are nine bananas and one apple in a room, and the correct answer is that it is very likely that there are indeed nine bananas.

Although the generated MCQ does not have the same options as the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content of the question are similar. Therefore, I would identify **Question 6** as the most similar generated MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **6**

**Transcript**:
The human brain is one of the most
sophisticated organs in the world, a supercomputer made of billions
of neurons that processes and controls all
of our senses, thoughts, and actions. But there was something Charles Darwin
found even more impressive: the brain of an ant, which he called one of the most
marvelous atoms of matter in the world. If you find it hard to believe that
something so tiny could have a complex brain, you're not alone. In his project to classify and describe
all living things, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus
assumed insects had no brains at all. He was wrong, but understandably so. Insect brains are not only miniscule, but in many respects, 
they function differently than our own. One of the most noticeable differences is that an insect that loses its head
can still walk, scratch itself, breathe, and even fly. This is because while our nervous system
works like a monarchy, with the brain calling the shots, the insect nervous system works
more like a decentralized federation. Many insect activities,
like walking or breathing, are coordinated by clusters of neurons,
also known as ganglia, along their bodies. Together with the brain, these local 
ganglia form the insect nervous system. While an insect can do a lot with just
its local ganglia, the brain is still crucial 
for its survival. An insect's brain lets it perceive
the world through sight and smell. It also chooses suitable mates, remembers locations of food sources
and hives, regulates communication, and even coordinates navigation
over huge distances. And this vast diversity of behaviors is controlled by an organ 
the size of the head of a pin, with less than one million neurons, compared to our 86 billion. But even though the insect brain
is organized very differently from ours, there are some striking similarities. For example, most insects have
smell detectors on their antennae, similar to those found in human noses. And our primary olfactory brain regions
look and function rather similarly, with clusters of neurons activated
and deactivated in precise timing to code for specific scents. Scientists have been astonished
by these similarities because insects and humans are not
very closely related. In fact, our last common ancestor
was a simple worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million
years ago. So how did we end up
with such similar brain structures when our evolution took almost
entirely different paths? Scientists call this phenomenon
convergent evolution. It's the same principle behind birds,
bats, and bees separately evolving wings. Similar selective pressures can cause
natural selection to favor the same evolutionary strategy in species with vastly different 
evolutionary pasts. By studying the comparison between
insect and human brains, scientists can thus understand which of
our brain functions are unique, and which are general solutions 
to evolutionary problems. But this is not the only reason scientists
are fascinated by insect brains. Their small size and simplicity makes it 
easier to understand exactly how neurons work together 
in the brain. This is also valuable for engineers, who study the insect brain to help design
control systems for everything from self-flying airplanes
to tiny search-and-rescue roach bots. So, size and complexity are not always
the most impressive things. The next time you try to swat a fly, take a moment to marvel at the efficiency
of its tiny nervous system as it outsmarts your fancy brain.

**Transcript**:
The human brain is one of the most
sophisticated organs in the world, a supercomputer made of billions
of neurons that processes and controls all
of our senses, thoughts, and actions. But there was something Charles Darwin
found even more impressive: the brain of an ant, which he called one of the most
marvelous atoms of matter in the world. If you find it hard to believe that
something so tiny could have a complex brain, you're not alone. In his project to classify and describe
all living things, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus
assumed insects had no brains at all. He was wrong, but understandably so. Insect brains are not only miniscule, but in many respects, 
they function differently than our own. One of the most noticeable differences is that an insect that loses its head
can still walk, scratch itself, breathe, and even fly. This is because while our nervous system
works like a monarchy, with the brain calling the shots, the insect nervous system works
more like a decentralized federation. Many insect activities,
like walking or breathing, are coordinated by clusters of neurons,
also known as ganglia, along their bodies. Together with the brain, these local 
ganglia form the insect nervous system. While an insect can do a lot with just
its local ganglia, the brain is still crucial 
for its survival. An insect's brain lets it perceive
the world through sight and smell. It also chooses suitable mates, remembers locations of food sources
and hives, regulates communication, and even coordinates navigation
over huge distances. And this vast diversity of behaviors is controlled by an organ 
the size of the head of a pin, with less than one million neurons, compared to our 86 billion. But even though the insect brain
is organized very differently from ours, there are some striking similarities. For example, most insects have
smell detectors on their antennae, similar to those found in human noses. And our primary olfactory brain regions
look and function rather similarly, with clusters of neurons activated
and deactivated in precise timing to code for specific scents. Scientists have been astonished
by these similarities because insects and humans are not
very closely related. In fact, our last common ancestor
was a simple worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million
years ago. So how did we end up
with such similar brain structures when our evolution took almost
entirely different paths? Scientists call this phenomenon
convergent evolution. It's the same principle behind birds,
bats, and bees separately evolving wings. Similar selective pressures can cause
natural selection to favor the same evolutionary strategy in species with vastly different 
evolutionary pasts. By studying the comparison between
insect and human brains, scientists can thus understand which of
our brain functions are unique, and which are general solutions 
to evolutionary problems. But this is not the only reason scientists
are fascinated by insect brains. Their small size and simplicity makes it 
easier to understand exactly how neurons work together 
in the brain. This is also valuable for engineers, who study the insect brain to help design

**Transcript**:
So you see a few cubes sitting in an art gallery, and you think to yourself, "This is the greatest hoax that anyone has ever pulled off." You immediately walk away, discouraged by the wide gulf between what you hope for when you walk into a museum and what they've presented to you. How did we get here? How could these cubes that the artist didn't even make with their own hands be important? This is the case for minimalism. First off, we're not talking about minimalism as a general sensibility
or the life-changing magic of tidying up. We're talking about the art of a particular moment in time. Namely, the 1960s, when all of a sudden,
there was a lot of geometric, abstract art. Some of it was painting by artists
like Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but most of it was sculpture by artists like Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Anne Truitt, Robert Morris, Tony Smith,
Ronald Bladen, and Sol LeWitt. Art critics called it ABC art, object art, primary structures, and cool art, but the term minimalism prevailed. These artists never called their art minimalist, by the way, nor did they like the term, or the implication that the work
was so reductive that it was minimally art. But minimalism was a rejection of what came before. Specifically, abstract expressionism, which dominated the art market in the 1950s. These new artists wanted to remove expression completely, remove emotion, empty the work of idiosyncratic gesture, make it resistant to biographical reading. Their hard-edged, basic shapes and forms avoided allusion, metaphor, and overt symbolism. The forms were often repeated, one thing after another in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements, rejecting compositional balancing. No artist hemming and hawing over the canvas here. The objects were impersonal, many of them machine-made, fabricated from new and industrial materials. Sometimes this entailed ready-made units, like Andre's bricks, or Flavin's fluorescent tubes. They didn't want you to ooh and ah,
or admire the handling of paint. As LeWitt once said, "It is best that the basic unit "be deliberately uninteresting." Robert Morris wrote that he could
hear a resounding no at the time. "No to transcendence and spiritual values, "heroic scale, anguished decisions, "historicizing narrative, valuable artifact, "intelligent structure, interesting visual experience." But what they were saying yes to
was a new and startling realness. Abandoning the pedestal to dismantle
the separation between you and the art. Judd claimed these works are neither painting nor sculpture, but instead specific objects occupying real space. These objects aren't pointing to anything
or referencing anything. Andre called his work a kind of plastic poetry, in which elements are combined to produce space. So there is no illusion of space, it just is space. Minimalism had its haters from the start. In 1967, art critic Michael Fried
attacked the work for being theatrical. For him it was an object in a room
that had presence before a viewer, but it did not have what good art has, which is presentness, or, "an instant of aesthetic experience "which occurs in no real space or time at all." But Fried really just ended up affirming
exactly what the artists were trying to do: proving how radical it really was. Despite its detractors, minimalism became all the rage. This geometric, unadorned style flowed throughout the worlds of fashion, theater, and design. In short, it was cool. And then because these artists were never trying to be minimalist to begin with, they moved on to other things
and other kinds of art had its day. But minimalism changed things. For centuries, art had been trying to trick you, convince you that the hunk of rock
was something other than a hunk of rock. But not this. You feel like there's gotta be some secret to it, but there isn't. There's nothing to interpret. This is what it is. It wasn't supposed to look like art of the past, and it wasn't supposed to function like it either. With minimalism, meaning doesn't rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context,
and exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art
can still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery
as you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room
shapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate.

and exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art
can still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery
as you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room
shapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate.

**Transcript**:
So you see a few cubes sitting in an art gallery, and you think to yourself, "This is the greatest hoax that anyone has ever pulled off." You immediately walk away, discouraged by the wide gulf between what you hope for when you walk into a museum and what they've presented to you. How did we get here? How could these cubes that the artist didn't even make with their own hands be important? This is the case for minimalism. First off, we're not talking about minimalism as a general sensibility
or the life-changing magic of tidying up. We're talking about the art of a particular moment in time. Namely, the 1960s, when all of a sudden,
there was a lot of geometric, abstract art. Some of it was painting by artists
like Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but most of it was sculpture by artists like Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Anne Truitt, Robert Morris, Tony Smith,
Ronald Bladen, and Sol LeWitt. Art critics called it ABC art, object art, primary structures, and cool art, but the term minimalism prevailed. These artists never called their art minimalist, by the way, nor did they like the term, or the implication that the work
was so reductive that it was minimally art. But minimalism was a rejection of what came before. Specifically, abstract expressionism, which dominated the art market in the 1950s. These new artists wanted to remove expression completely, remove emotion, empty the work of idiosyncratic gesture, make it resistant to biographical reading. Their hard-edged, basic shapes and forms avoided allusion, metaphor, and overt symbolism. The forms were often repeated, one thing after another in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements, rejecting compositional balancing. No artist hemming and hawing over the canvas here. The objects were impersonal, many of them machine-made, fabricated from new and industrial materials. Sometimes this entailed ready-made units, like Andre's bricks, or Flavin's fluorescent tubes. They didn't want you to ooh and ah,
or admire the handling of paint. As LeWitt once said, "It is best that the basic unit "be deliberately uninteresting." Robert Morris wrote that he could
hear a resounding no at the time. "No to transcendence and spiritual values, "heroic scale, anguished decisions, "historicizing narrative, valuable artifact, "intelligent structure, interesting visual experience." But what they were saying yes to
was a new and startling realness. Abandoning the pedestal to dismantle
the separation between you and the art. Judd claimed these works are neither painting nor sculpture, but instead specific objects occupying real space. These objects aren't pointing to anything
or referencing anything. Andre called his work a kind of plastic poetry, in which elements are combined to produce space. So there is no illusion of space, it just is space. Minimalism had its haters from the start. In 1967, art critic Michael Fried
attacked the work for being theatrical. For him it was an object in a room
that had presence before a viewer, but it did not have what good art has, which is presentness, or, "an instant of aesthetic experience "which occurs in no real space or time at all." But Fried really just ended up affirming
exactly what the artists were trying to do: proving how radical it really was. Despite its detractors, minimalism became all the rage. This geometric, unadorned style flowed throughout the worlds of fashion, theater, and design. In short, it was cool. And then because these artists were never trying to be minimalist to begin with, they moved on to other things
and other kinds of art had its day. But minimalism changed things. For centuries, art had been trying to trick you, convince you that the hunk of rock
was something other than a hunk of rock. But not this. You feel like there's gotta be some secret to it, but there isn't. There's nothing to interpret. This is what it is. It wasn't supposed to look like art of the past, and it wasn't supposed to function like it either. With minimalism, meaning doesn't rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context,
and exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art
can still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery
as you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room
shapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate.

**Transcript**:
So you see a few cubes sitting in an art gallery, and you think to yourself, "This is the greatest hoax that anyone has ever pulled off." You immediately walk away, discouraged by the wide gulf between what you hope for when you walk into a museum and what they've presented to you. How did we get here? How could these cubes that the artist didn't even make with their own hands be important? This is the case for minimalism. First off, we're not talking about minimalism as a general sensibility
or the life-changing magic of tidying up. We're talking about the art of a particular moment in time. Namely, the 1960s, when all of a sudden,
there was a lot of geometric, abstract art. Some of it was painting by artists
like Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but most of it was sculpture by artists like Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Anne Truitt, Robert Morris, Tony Smith,
Ronald Bladen, and Sol LeWitt. Art critics called it ABC art, object art, primary structures, and cool art, but the term minimalism prevailed. These artists never called their art minimalist, by the way, nor did they like the term, or the implication that the work
was so reductive that it was minimally art. But minimalism was a rejection of what came before. Specifically, abstract expressionism, which dominated the art market in the 1950s. These new artists wanted to remove expression completely, remove emotion, empty the work of idiosyncratic gesture, make it resistant to biographical reading. Their hard-edged, basic shapes and forms avoided allusion, metaphor, and overt symbolism. The forms were often repeated, one thing after another in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements, rejecting compositional balancing. No artist hemming and hawing over the canvas here. The objects were impersonal, many of them machine-made, fabricated from new and industrial materials. Sometimes this entailed ready-made units, like Andre's bricks, or Flavin's fluorescent tubes. They didn't want you to ooh and ah,
or admire the handling of paint. As LeWitt once said, "It is best that the basic unit "be deliberately uninteresting." Robert Morris wrote that he could
hear a resounding no at the time. "No to transcendence and spiritual values, "heroic scale, anguished decisions, "historicizing narrative, valuable artifact, "intelligent structure, interesting visual experience." But what they were saying yes to
was a new and startling realness. Abandoning the pedestal to dismantle
the separation between you and the art. Judd claimed these works are neither painting nor sculpture, but instead specific objects occupying real space. These objects aren't pointing to anything
or referencing anything. Andre called his work a kind of plastic poetry, in which elements are combined to produce space. So there is no illusion of space, it just is space. Minimalism had its haters from the start. In 1967, art critic Michael Fried
attacked the work for being theatrical. For him it was an object in a room
that had presence before a viewer, but it did not have what good art has, which is presentness, or, "an instant of aesthetic experience "which occurs in no real space or time at all." But Fried really just ended up affirming
exactly what the artists were trying to do: proving how radical it really was. Despite its detractors, minimalism became all the rage. This geometric, unadorned style flowed throughout the worlds of fashion, theater, and design. In short, it was cool. And then because these artists were never trying to be minimalist to begin with, they moved on to other things
and other kinds of art had its day. But minimalism changed things. For centuries, art had been trying to trick you, convince you that the hunk of rock
was something other than a hunk of rock. But not this. You feel like there's gotta be some secret to it, but there isn't. There's nothing to interpret. This is what it is. It wasn't supposed to look like art of the past, and it wasn't supposed to function like it either. With minimalism, meaning doesn't rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context,
and exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art
can still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery
as you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room
shapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate.

**Transcript**:
Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum
of natural history. Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t
there because you need them but because your animal ancestors did.
No longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared,
these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by
natural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your
thumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up.
If you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle
in your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris
longus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing
on one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though.
There’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that
surgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.
You can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those
that use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer
in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a
lot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look
at the three that are attached to our outer ear.
We can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our
mammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds.
Presumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals.
In humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes.
In one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response
to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable.
And you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from
a speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying
(and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial
body parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to
our body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin
to form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised
hair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm.
Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures,
and it’s also part of the fight or flight response.
So it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened.
And it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps.
And then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some
people have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone.
It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our
ancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one
point. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans
embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates.
And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae.
In many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail.
But in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks
after they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the
ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until
they’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s
a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from
the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior. These babies are only 1 month old and you
can see that their inner monkey can support their entire weight.

ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until
they’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s
a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from
the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior. These babies are only 1 month old and you
can see that their inner monkey can support their entire weight.

**Transcript**:
Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum
of natural history. Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t
there because you need them but because your animal ancestors did.
No longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared,
these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by
natural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your
thumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up.
If you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle
in your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris
longus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing
on one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though.
There’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that
surgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.
You can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those
that use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer
in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a
lot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look
at the three that are attached to our outer ear.
We can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our
mammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds.
Presumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals.
In humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes.
In one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response
to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable.
And you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from
a speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying
(and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial
body parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to
our body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin
to form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised
hair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm.
Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures,
and it’s also part of the fight or flight response.
So it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened.
And it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps.
And then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some
people have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone.
It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our
ancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one
point. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans
embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates.
And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae.
In many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail.
But in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks
after they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the
ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until

**Transcript**:
The story of the Buddha’s life, like all
of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century
B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then
called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy
man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called The four noble
truths The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble
eightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of
the importance of facing suffering directly. We must do our best to liberate ourselves
from the grip of our own desires, and recognise that suffering can be viewed
as part of our common connection with others, spurring us to compassion and gentleness.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and options provided, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the meaning of the word "Buddha." While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 3 mentions the concept of Nirvana and the state of enlightenment, which is closely related to the Buddha's teachings.

However, a more relevant question is not available among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, as it asks about the root of all suffering according to the Buddha, and one of the options (B) mentions "Attachment and desire," which is a concept closely related to the Buddha's teachings. Nevertheless, this question does not directly ask about the meaning of the word "Buddha."

If I really had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 6

called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy
man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called The four noble
truths The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble
eightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of
the importance of facing suffering directly. We must do our best to liberate ourselves
from the grip of our own desires, and recognise that suffering can be viewed
as part of our common connection with others, spurring us to compassion and gentleness.

first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble
eightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of
the importance of facing suffering directly. We must do our best to liberate ourselves
from the grip of our own desires, and recognise that suffering can be viewed
as part of our common connection with others, spurring us to compassion and gentleness.

**Transcript**:
The story of the Buddha’s life, like all
of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century
B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then
called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy
man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called The four noble
truths The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering

**Transcript**:
Almost 2000 years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca peered 
at his book through a glass of water. Suddenly, the text below was transformed. The words magically became clear. But it wasn't until a millennium later
that that same principle would be used to create 
the earliest glasses. Today, glasses can help millions of people
with poor vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The key to understanding what that means
lies with the term refraction, the ability of a transparent medium,
like glass, water, or the eye to change the direction
of light passing through it. The eye has two main refractive surfaces: the cornea and the lens. Ideally, these surfaces work together to refract light in a way that accurately
focuses light onto the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue
at the back of the eye that works with the brain
to give rise to vision. But many people develop refractive errors, either during childhood 
as their eyes are growing, or in later life as their eyes age. Imperfections in the cornea and lens cause refracted light to be focused
in front of or behind the retina, making images appear blurry. People with refractive errors
can still see color, movement, and light, but the details of what they're looking at
are out of focus. People experience refractive 
errors in different ways, owing to differences in their eyes. In some, light refracts too much, and in others, too little. Eyes with a focal point 
in front of the retina are called myopic, or short-sighted. They can see close objects clearly, but those far away are out of focus. But when the focus point 
is behind the retina, people are hyperopic,
or long-sighted. For them, objects close up
are unfocused, but distant objects are crystal clear. Finally, some people have a cornea
with a non-spherical shape that causes astigmatism, a form of out-of-focus vision
that makes all objects seem blurred, whether close or far. As we age, our eyes face new challenges. When we're young, the lens of the eye
is flexible and can change shape to bring
images into focus, something called accommodation. This keeps objects in focus when we
shift our gaze from far to near. But as we get older, the lens becomes
less flexible, and can't change shape when we want
to look at near objects. This is called presbyopia, and it affects adults starting
around the age of 40 years. Myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Each of these is a refractive error. Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses
or contact lenses, which work by refocusing light
so it strikes the retina precisely. It's even possible to correct vision
with surgery using lasers that change the shape
of the cornea and alter its refractive properties. But glasses remain the most popular. By using carefully crafted lenses to steer light to exactly 
the right spot on the retina, a person's clear vision can be restored. We've come a long way 
since Seneca's discovery and the crude glasses of yesteryear. In 1727, a British optician named
Edward Scarlett developed the modern style of glasses which are kept in place with arms
which hook over each ear. Today's glasses take their inspiration
from that design, but they're also much more precise
and personal. Each pair is tailored for an individual
to bring out their unique powers of sight. So if you're one of the 500 million people
with a problem with close or far vision, or both, there's a pair of glasses out there
waiting to reveal a whole new world that's hiding in plain view.

at his book through a glass of water. Suddenly, the text below was transformed. The words magically became clear. But it wasn't until a millennium later
that that same principle would be used to create 
the earliest glasses. Today, glasses can help millions of people
with poor vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The key to understanding what that means
lies with the term refraction, the ability of a transparent medium,
like glass, water, or the eye to change the direction
of light passing through it. The eye has two main refractive surfaces: the cornea and the lens. Ideally, these surfaces work together to refract light in a way that accurately
focuses light onto the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue
at the back of the eye that works with the brain
to give rise to vision. But many people develop refractive errors, either during childhood 
as their eyes are growing, or in later life as their eyes age. Imperfections in the cornea and lens cause refracted light to be focused
in front of or behind the retina, making images appear blurry. People with refractive errors
can still see color, movement, and light, but the details of what they're looking at
are out of focus. People experience refractive 
errors in different ways, owing to differences in their eyes. In some, light refracts too much, and in others, too little. Eyes with a focal point 
in front of the retina are called myopic, or short-sighted. They can see close objects clearly, but those far away are out of focus. But when the focus point 
is behind the retina, people are hyperopic,
or long-sighted. For them, objects close up
are unfocused, but distant objects are crystal clear. Finally, some people have a cornea
with a non-spherical shape that causes astigmatism, a form of out-of-focus vision
that makes all objects seem blurred, whether close or far. As we age, our eyes face new challenges. When we're young, the lens of the eye
is flexible and can change shape to bring
images into focus, something called accommodation. This keeps objects in focus when we
shift our gaze from far to near. But as we get older, the lens becomes
less flexible, and can't change shape when we want
to look at near objects. This is called presbyopia, and it affects adults starting
around the age of 40 years. Myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Each of these is a refractive error. Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses
or contact lenses, which work by refocusing light
so it strikes the retina precisely. It's even possible to correct vision
with surgery using lasers that change the shape
of the cornea and alter its refractive properties. But glasses remain the most popular. By using carefully crafted lenses to steer light to exactly 
the right spot on the retina, a person's clear vision can be restored. We've come a long way 
since Seneca's discovery and the crude glasses of yesteryear. In 1727, a British optician named
Edward Scarlett developed the modern style of glasses which are kept in place with arms
which hook over each ear. Today's glasses take their inspiration
from that design, but they're also much more precise
and personal. Each pair is tailored for an individual
to bring out their unique powers of sight. So if you're one of the 500 million people
with a problem with close or far vision, or both, there's a pair of glasses out there
waiting to reveal a whole new world that's hiding in plain view.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs are related to the topic of the transcript, but they do not address the specific question of solutions for correcting refractive errors.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar, but some of the generated MCQs (e.g., Question 5, Question 6, Question 7, Question 8) are related to refractive errors, which is the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ could be:

Question: Which of the following is NOT a common method for correcting refractive errors?
Options: A. Glasses, B. Contact lenses, C. Laser eye surgery, D. Eye exercises

This new generated MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Since none of the original generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index.

How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks 
like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled
by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over
and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties
of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons, you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain, and trillions of connections between
all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated
system like that on, it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things 
like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task
over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron
in the brain is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity, feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits
described earlier. And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options, it is the closest match in terms of question intent. Question 3 asks about the two basic rules that individual fish follow to create the complex swarming behaviors of a school, which is related to the ground truth MCQ that asks what determines how a school of fish will behave.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the factors that influence the behavior of a school of fish, with options that include the number of fish in the school, how closely each fish wants to swim next to its neighbor, and how quickly the fish are swimming.

Since there is no exact match, I will provide the index of the closest match:

**Transcript**:
How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks 
like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled
by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over
and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties
of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons, you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain, and trillions of connections between
all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated
system like that on, it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things 
like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task
over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron
in the brain is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity, feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits
described earlier. And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.

**Transcript**:
Your rich, eccentric uncle 
just passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have
been invited to the reading of his will. He wanted to leave 
all of his money to you, but he knew that if he did,
your relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything 
you need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following 
note in his will: "I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together,
you will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find
the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance 
all to yourself. Good luck." The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives
to a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number
from 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then 
close every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status
of every third locker, specifically if it's open, 
she'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until
all 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain
open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start
down the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer
you know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number
of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors
in the locker number. For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 
are the factors of 6. So when a locker has an even number
of factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open. Most of the lockers 
have an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors
naturally pair up. In fact, the only lockers that have
an odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when
multiplied by itself equals the number. For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it. 3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once. Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open. You know that these ten lockers 
are the solution, so you open them immediately
and read the words inside: "The code is the first five lockers
touched only twice." You realize that the only lockers 
touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. So the code is 2-3-5-7-11. The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance. Too bad your relatives were always
too busy being nasty to each other to pay attention 
to your eccentric uncle's riddles.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5: "Which lockers remained open at the end of the puzzle?" 

Although this question does not directly ask about the first locker to remain open, it is related to the concept of lockers remaining open. To answer the ground truth MCQ, one needs to understand the pattern of lockers remaining open, which is addressed in Question 5.

However, if I had to choose an answer that could lead to the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the answer can be inferred from Question 4 or 6, which provide insight into how to determine the lockers that remain open.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ and only provide related information, I will not provide an index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5: "Which lockers remained open at the end of the puzzle?" 

Although the options do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, the intent of the question is related to identifying the lockers that remain open. To answer the ground truth MCQ, one would need to understand the pattern of the lockers and identify the second perfect square (since perfect squares have an odd number of factors and remain open). 

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, it's essential to note that the similarity is limited.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 5 is the most similar, but with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Your rich, eccentric uncle 
just passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have
been invited to the reading of his will. He wanted to leave 
all of his money to you, but he knew that if he did,
your relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything 
you need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following 
note in his will: "I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together,
you will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find
the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance 
all to yourself. Good luck." The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives
to a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number
from 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then 
close every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status
of every third locker, specifically if it's open, 
she'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until
all 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain
open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start
down the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer
you know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number
of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors
in the locker number. For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 
are the factors of 6. So when a locker has an even number
of factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open. Most of the lockers 
have an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors
naturally pair up. In fact, the only lockers that have
an odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when
multiplied by itself equals the number. For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it. 3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once. Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open. You know that these ten lockers 
are the solution, so you open them immediately
and read the words inside: "The code is the first five lockers
touched only twice." You realize that the only lockers 
touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. So the code is 2-3-5-7-11. The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance. Too bad your relatives were always
too busy being nasty to each other to pay attention 
to your eccentric uncle's riddles.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of lockers that remain open after a certain process. The closest generated MCQ that relates to this concept is Question 5: "Which lockers remained open at the end of the puzzle?" However, this question does not ask about the number of lockers, but rather the type of lockers that remain open.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 5, but with the understanding that it is not a direct match.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the topic of factors, the closest match would be Question 4, which discusses the relationship between the number of times a locker is touched and the number of factors in the locker number.

But since none of the generated MCQs ask about the number of factors for a specific number, I would say that there isn't a direct match.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest in terms of topic, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Many of the inanimate objects around you
probably seem perfectly still. But look deep into the atomic structure
of any of them, and you'll see a world in constant flux. Stretching, contracting, springing, jittering, drifting atoms everywhere. And though that movement may seem chaotic,
it's not random. Atoms that are bonded together, and that describes almost all substances, move according to a set of principles. For example, take molecules,
atoms held together by covalent bonds. There are three basic ways 
molecules can move: rotation, translation, and vibration. Rotation and translation 
move a molecule in space while its atoms stay 
the same distance apart. Vibration, on the other hand, 
changes those distances, actually altering the molecule's shape. For any molecule, you can count up
the number of different ways it can move. That corresponds to 
its degrees of freedom, which in the context of mechanics basically means the number of variables
we need to take into account to understand the full system. Three-dimensional space is defined by
x, y, and z axes. Translation allows the molecule to move
in the direction of any of them. That's three degrees of freedom. It can also rotate around 
any of these three axes. That's three more, unless it's a linear molecule, 
like carbon dioxide. There, one of the rotations just spins
the molecule around its own axis, which doesn't count because it doesn't
change the position of the atoms. Vibration is where it gets a bit tricky. Let's take a simple molecule,
like hydrogen. The length of the bond that holds the two
atoms together is constantly changing as if the atoms were connected 
by a spring. That change in distance is tiny,
less than a billionth of a meter. The more atoms and bonds a molecule has,
the more vibrational modes. For example, a water molecule 
has three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogens,
and two bonds. That gives it three modes of vibration: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. More complicated molecules have even
fancier vibrational modes, like rocking, wagging, and twisting. If you know how many atoms a molecule has,
you can count its vibrational modes. Start with the total degrees of freedom, which is three times the number
of atoms in the molecule. That's because each atom can move
in three different directions. Three of the total correspond 
to translation when all the atoms 
are going in the same direction. And three, or two for linear molecules,
correspond to rotations. All the rest, 3N-6
or 3N-5 for linear molecules, are vibrations. So what's causing all this motion? Molecules move because they absorb
energy from their surroundings, mainly in the form of heat
or electromagnetic radiation. When this energy gets transferred
to the molecules, they vibrate, rotate, or translate faster. Faster motion increases the kinetic energy
of the molecules and atoms. We define this as an increase 
in temperature and thermal energy. This is the phenomenon your microwave oven
uses to heat your food. The oven emits microwave radiation,
which is absorbed by the molecules, especially those of water. They move around faster and faster, bumping into each other and increasing
the food's temperature and thermal energy. The greenhouse effect is another example. Some of the solar radiation 
that hits the Earth's surface is reflected back to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like water vapor
and carbon dioxide absorb this radiation and speed up. These hotter, faster-moving molecules
emit infrared radiation in all directions, including back to Earth, warming it. Does all this molecular motion ever stop? You might think that would happen
at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. No one's ever managed to cool
anything down that much, but even if we could, molecules would still move due to
a quantum mechanical principle called zero-point energy. In other words, everything has been moving
since the universe's very first moments, and will keep going long, 
long after we're gone.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4: How many degrees of freedom does a molecule have for translation in three-dimensional space? Options: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about rotational degrees of freedom. Among the generated MCQs, none directly asks about rotational degrees of freedom. But Question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing degrees of freedom.

**Transcript**:
Many of the inanimate objects around you
probably seem perfectly still. But look deep into the atomic structure
of any of them, and you'll see a world in constant flux. Stretching, contracting, springing, jittering, drifting atoms everywhere. And though that movement may seem chaotic,
it's not random. Atoms that are bonded together, and that describes almost all substances, move according to a set of principles. For example, take molecules,
atoms held together by covalent bonds. There are three basic ways 
molecules can move: rotation, translation, and vibration. Rotation and translation 
move a molecule in space while its atoms stay 
the same distance apart. Vibration, on the other hand, 
changes those distances, actually altering the molecule's shape. For any molecule, you can count up
the number of different ways it can move. That corresponds to 
its degrees of freedom, which in the context of mechanics basically means the number of variables
we need to take into account to understand the full system. Three-dimensional space is defined by
x, y, and z axes. Translation allows the molecule to move
in the direction of any of them. That's three degrees of freedom. It can also rotate around 
any of these three axes. That's three more, unless it's a linear molecule, 
like carbon dioxide. There, one of the rotations just spins
the molecule around its own axis, which doesn't count because it doesn't
change the position of the atoms. Vibration is where it gets a bit tricky. Let's take a simple molecule,
like hydrogen. The length of the bond that holds the two
atoms together is constantly changing as if the atoms were connected 
by a spring. That change in distance is tiny,
less than a billionth of a meter. The more atoms and bonds a molecule has,
the more vibrational modes. For example, a water molecule 
has three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogens,
and two bonds. That gives it three modes of vibration: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. More complicated molecules have even
fancier vibrational modes, like rocking, wagging, and twisting. If you know how many atoms a molecule has,
you can count its vibrational modes. Start with the total degrees of freedom, which is three times the number
of atoms in the molecule. That's because each atom can move
in three different directions. Three of the total correspond 
to translation when all the atoms 
are going in the same direction. And three, or two for linear molecules,
correspond to rotations. All the rest, 3N-6
or 3N-5 for linear molecules, are vibrations. So what's causing all this motion? Molecules move because they absorb
energy from their surroundings, mainly in the form of heat
or electromagnetic radiation. When this energy gets transferred
to the molecules, they vibrate, rotate, or translate faster. Faster motion increases the kinetic energy
of the molecules and atoms. We define this as an increase 
in temperature and thermal energy. This is the phenomenon your microwave oven
uses to heat your food. The oven emits microwave radiation,
which is absorbed by the molecules, especially those of water. They move around faster and faster, bumping into each other and increasing
the food's temperature and thermal energy. The greenhouse effect is another example. Some of the solar radiation 
that hits the Earth's surface is reflected back to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like water vapor
and carbon dioxide absorb this radiation and speed up. These hotter, faster-moving molecules
emit infrared radiation in all directions, including back to Earth, warming it. Does all this molecular motion ever stop? You might think that would happen
at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. No one's ever managed to cool
anything down that much, but even if we could, molecules would still move due to
a quantum mechanical principle called zero-point energy. In other words, everything has been moving
since the universe's very first moments, and will keep going long, 
long after we're gone.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the movement of a molecule around its axes, which is known as rotation. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is about the basic ways molecules can move, which includes rotation. However, it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose the closest match, I would say Question 2 is the most similar, but it's not an exact match. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the movement of a molecule around its axes.

Since I have to provide an index, I will choose the closest match:

Index: 2

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be required to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9: How many years did Bess Houdini hold seances in an attempt to contact her husband after his death? 

However, the question content does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the reason for Bess holding seances. Unfortunately, there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the given options, I would choose Question 4: Why did Harry Houdini visit hundreds of mediums and spiritual gatherings? 

This question is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it deals with the topic of spiritual gatherings and communication with the dead. However, the question content and options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, with an index of 4.

Harry Houdini was without doubt the most famous and talented Illusionist to ever walk the earth few performers have captured the Public's imagination like Houdini did and even today over a hundred years later his legacy continues to live on so here are five things you may not have known about this magnificent showman Houdini escapes from seemingly impossible situations thrilled audiences but his obsession for Perfection and extreme motivation in his prce practice often wasn't seen by his fans in order to perform his mind-blowing stuns Houdini had to train intensely both physically and mentally he trained himself to be ambidextrous making his left hand as able as his right he was said to practice untying knots with his toes so much so that his toes had the dexterity of his fingers he would swallow large objects and regurgitate them back up again he practiced slight of hand and misdirection in front of a large mirror for hours and hours at a time and his practice sessions were so constant that he would frequently forget to eat change and even bathe of course all this dedication consumed most of his time meaning there was hardly time to sleep 4 hours a night was said to be a lion for Houdini but if in his short hours of sleep he did awake with an idea for a new stun or trick there was always a notebook by his bedside in order for him to write it down he even had a large sunken bathtub installed in his house where he could practice his breath holds and would fill it with ice in order to prepare his body for his handcuffed free ing River plunges he built himself into the man he wanted to become and you can't help but respect every ounce of that his bizarre interest in the maab he would study murder cases and used to enjoy performing to inmates on death row he even bought a device that would eventually kill the men he was performing for a real electric chair which was used to kill inmates on death row at the Sing Sing prison he was also very interested in life after death he would visit hundreds of mediums and spiritual GTO togethers in an attempt to to contact his deceased mother who he loved dearly but of course he couldn't just turn up to a seance unnoticed so he would disguise himself with a hat and a fake beard Houdini later said that all mediums were conmen and wrote this in an article in the 25 years of my investigation and the hundreds of seances which I've attended I have never seen or heard anything that could convince me that there is a possibility of communications with the loved ones who have gone beyond despite saying this Houdini still believed in the afterlife he just wasn't convinced that communication was possible Houdini's imaginary son now it's unsure why Houdini and his wife of 32 years Bess didn't have children some say Bess was unable to carry and others say that Houdini was x-rayed many times by his brother who was remarkably New York's first x-ray specialist and the constant exposure to radiation made Houdini sterile but just because they couldn't have a child it didn't mean they couldn't invent one yep they invented a son and he was called mayor Samuel Houdini named after Harry's father while Harry was away he would write letters to Bess asking how his son was getting on and what he'd been up to Bess would let Harry know that mayor was doing well the final letters written about their son was that he was doing well and had now become the president of the United States now lots of people say that they were both just nuts but I see it as a cute way to bring each other closer together and help brighten the fact that he couldn't have children Houdini was killed by one of his own fans Harry died of peritonitis secondary to a ruptured appendix on October the 31st Halloween in 1926 he was aged just 52 his insurance company concluded that the death was due to him being punched in the stomach by a university student called Jay Gordon Whitehead Whitehead was witnessed delivering several heavy blows to Houdini's stomach before he had the chance to prepare after the incident Houdini continued performing his upcoming show in a great deal of pain the pain lasted for 2 days and when he finally visited a doctor he was told he had a fever and acute appendicitis he was advised to have immediate surgery but Houdini being so dedicated to his craft ignored the advice and decided to go on

despite this he took to the stage he was reported to have passed out during the show but was revived and continued to perform afterwards he was hospitalized at Detroit's Grace Hospital where he died shortly after his last words were said to be I am weaker I guess I have lost the fight the Houdini paranormal ritual despite Houdini not seeing any firsthand proof of communication with the afterlife he certainly believed in life after death and always told his wife B that if he died he would attempt to communicate with her if he was able to do so he gave her a secret code that if she heard being whispered one day or if a spiritualist said the secret code was coming through during a seance Bess would know it was her husband every Halloween Bess would haul a seance in an attempt to contact him but after 10 years with no success she gave up incredibly though the Seance still continues to this day every year on October the 31st a group of spiritualists hold a ritual in an attempt to

he certainly believed in life after death and always told his wife B that if he died he would attempt to communicate with her if he was able to do so he gave her a secret code that if she heard being whispered one day or if a spiritualist said the secret code was coming through during a seance Bess would know it was her husband every Halloween Bess would haul a seance in an attempt to contact him but after 10 years with no success she gave up incredibly though the Seance still continues to this day every year on October the 31st a group of spiritualists hold a ritual in an attempt to

**Transcript**:
In the third act of "Swan Lake," the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly
endless series of turns, bobbing up and down on one pointed foot and spinning around, and around,
and around 32 times. It's one of the toughest sequences
in ballet, and for those thirty seconds or so, she's like a human top 
in perpetual motion. Those spectacular turns
are called fouettés, which means "whipped" in French, describing the dancer's incredible
ability to whip around without stopping. But while we're marveling at the fouetté,
can we unravel its physics? The dancer starts the fouetté by pushing
off with her foot to generate torque. But the hard part 
is maintaining the rotation. As she turns, friction between her pointe shoe 
and the floor, and somewhat between her body and the air, reduces her momentum. So how does she keep turning? Between each turn, the dancer pauses
for a split second and faces the audience. Her supporting foot flattens, and then twists as it rises 
back onto pointe, pushing against the floor to generate
a tiny amount of new torque. At the same time, her arms sweep open
to help her keep her balance. The turns are most effective if her center
of gravity stays constant, and a skilled dancer will be able to keep
her turning axis vertical. The extended arms 
and torque-generating foot both help drive the fouetté. But the real secret and the reason
you hardly notice the pause is that her other leg never stops moving. During her momentary pause, the dancer's elevated leg straightens
and moves from the front to the side, before it folds back into her knee. By staying in motion, that leg is storing
some of the momentum of the turn. When the leg comes back in 
towards the body, that stored momentum gets transferred
back to the dancer's body, propelling her around as she rises
back onto pointe. As the ballerina extends and retracts
her leg with each turn, momentum travels back and forth
between leg and body, keeping her in motion. A really good ballerina can get more
than one turn out of every leg extension in one of two ways. First, she can extend her leg sooner. The longer the leg is extended,
the more momentum it stores, and the more momentum it can return
to the body when it's pulled back in. More angular momentum means
she can make more turns before needing to replenish
what was lost to friction. The other option is for the dancer to bring her arms 
or leg in closer to her body once she returns to pointe. Why does this work? Like every other turn in ballet, the fouetté is governed 
by angular momentum, which is equal to the dancer's angular
velocity times her rotational inertia. And except for what's lost to friction, that angular momentum has to stay
constant while the dancer is on pointe. That's called conservation
of angular momentum. Now, rotational inertia can be thought of as a body's resistance 
to rotational motion. It increases when more mass is distributed
further from the axis of rotation, and decreases when the mass is distributed
closer to the axis of rotation. So as she brings her arms closer
to her body, her rotational inertia shrinks. In order to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity,
the speed of her turn, has to increase, allowing the same amount 
of stored momentum to carry her through multiple turns. You've probably seen ice skaters
do the same thing, spinning faster and faster
by drawing in their arms and legs. In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Black Swan
is a sorceress, and her 32 captivating fouettés do seem
almost supernatural. But it's not magic that 
makes them possible. It's physics.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not directly ask for the definition of a fouetté, it does ask for the name of the ballet move described in the passage, which is essentially asking for the term that corresponds to the definition provided. The correct answer to Question 1 is A. Fouetté, which is closely related to the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ, A. Turn.

However, a more precise match can be found in Question 2, which asks for the meaning of the word "fouetté" in French. The passage states that "fouetté" means "whipped" in French, describing the dancer's ability to whip around without stopping. This is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks for the definition of a fouetté. 

But since "whipped" is not among the options of the ground truth MCQ, and "turn" is not among the options of Question 2, the best match is still not perfect.

Considering the options provided, the best match is Question 1.

**Transcript**:
In the third act of "Swan Lake," the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly
endless series of turns, bobbing up and down on one pointed foot and spinning around, and around,
and around 32 times. It's one of the toughest sequences
in ballet, and for those thirty seconds or so, she's like a human top 
in perpetual motion. Those spectacular turns
are called fouettés, which means "whipped" in French, describing the dancer's incredible
ability to whip around without stopping. But while we're marveling at the fouetté,
can we unravel its physics? The dancer starts the fouetté by pushing
off with her foot to generate torque. But the hard part 
is maintaining the rotation. As she turns, friction between her pointe shoe 
and the floor, and somewhat between her body and the air, reduces her momentum. So how does she keep turning? Between each turn, the dancer pauses
for a split second and faces the audience. Her supporting foot flattens, and then twists as it rises 
back onto pointe, pushing against the floor to generate
a tiny amount of new torque. At the same time, her arms sweep open
to help her keep her balance. The turns are most effective if her center
of gravity stays constant, and a skilled dancer will be able to keep
her turning axis vertical. The extended arms 
and torque-generating foot both help drive the fouetté. But the real secret and the reason
you hardly notice the pause is that her other leg never stops moving. During her momentary pause, the dancer's elevated leg straightens
and moves from the front to the side, before it folds back into her knee. By staying in motion, that leg is storing
some of the momentum of the turn. When the leg comes back in 
towards the body, that stored momentum gets transferred
back to the dancer's body, propelling her around as she rises
back onto pointe. As the ballerina extends and retracts
her leg with each turn, momentum travels back and forth
between leg and body, keeping her in motion. A really good ballerina can get more
than one turn out of every leg extension in one of two ways. First, she can extend her leg sooner. The longer the leg is extended,
the more momentum it stores, and the more momentum it can return
to the body when it's pulled back in. More angular momentum means
she can make more turns before needing to replenish
what was lost to friction. The other option is for the dancer to bring her arms 
or leg in closer to her body once she returns to pointe. Why does this work? Like every other turn in ballet, the fouetté is governed 
by angular momentum, which is equal to the dancer's angular
velocity times her rotational inertia. And except for what's lost to friction, that angular momentum has to stay
constant while the dancer is on pointe. That's called conservation
of angular momentum. Now, rotational inertia can be thought of as a body's resistance 
to rotational motion. It increases when more mass is distributed
further from the axis of rotation, and decreases when the mass is distributed
closer to the axis of rotation. So as she brings her arms closer
to her body, her rotational inertia shrinks. In order to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity,
the speed of her turn, has to increase, allowing the same amount 
of stored momentum to carry her through multiple turns. You've probably seen ice skaters
do the same thing, spinning faster and faster
by drawing in their arms and legs. In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Black Swan
is a sorceress, and her 32 captivating fouettés do seem
almost supernatural. But it's not magic that 
makes them possible. It's physics.

**Transcript**:
Among the great poets of literary history, certain names like Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Whitman are instantly recognizable. However, there's an early 20th century
great French poet whose name you may not know: Guillaume Apollinaire. He was a close friend and collaborator
of artists like Picasso, Rousseau, and Chagall. He coined the term surrealism, and he was even suspected of stealing
the Mona Lisa in 1911. During his short lifetime, he created poetry that combined
text and image in a way that seemingly predicted
an artistic revolution to come. In the late 19th 
and early 20th century Paris, the low-rent districts of Montmartre
and Montparnasse were home to every 
kind of starving artist. It was all they could afford. These painters, writers, 
and intellectuals, united in their artistic passion
and counterculture beliefs, made up France's bohemian subculture. And their works of art, literature,
and intellect would shake up the world. At the turn of the 20th century, within this dynamic scene, art critic, poet, 
and champion of the avant-garde, Guillaume Apollinaire 
was a well-known fixture. As an art critic, Apollinaire explained the cubist 
and surrealist movements to the world, and rose to the defense 
of many young artists in the face of what was often
a xenophobic and narrow-minded public. As a poet, Apollinaire was passionate
about all forms of art and a connoisseur of medieval literature, especially calligraphy 
and illuminated initials. As a visionary, Apollinaire saw a gap
between two artistic institutions. On one side was the popular, highly 
lauded traditional art forms of the time. On the other, the forms 
of artistic expression made possible through surrealism, cubism, and new inventions, 
like the cinema and the phonograph. Within that divide, through the creation of his most important
contribution to poetry, the calligram, Guillaume Apollinaire built a bridge. Apollinaire created the calligram
as a poem picture, a written portrait, a thoughts drawing, and he used it to express his modernism and his desire to push poetry beyond
the normal bounds of text and verse and into the 20th century. Some of his calligrams are funny, like the "Lettre-Océan." Some of them are dedicated
to his young dead friends, like "La Colombe Poignardée 
et le jet d'eau." Some of them are the expression
of an emotional moment, as is "Il Pleut": "It's raining women's voices
as if they had died even in memory, and it's raining you as well,
Marvellous encounters of my life, o little drops. Those rearing clouds begin to neigh
a whole universe of auricular cities. Listen if it rains while regret
and disdain weep to an ancient music. Listen to the bonds fall off
which hold you above and below." Each calligram is intended
to allow readers to unchain themselves from the regular experience of poetry, and feel and see something new. "Lettre-Océan" is first an image to be seen
before even the words are read. Text-only elements combine with words
in shapes and forms. Two circular forms, 
one locked in a square, the other, morph beyond
the page in the shape of a spiral. Together they create a picture
that hints towards cubism. Then on closer reading of the text, the descriptive words within suggest the image of an aerial view 
of the Eiffel Tower. They give tribute to electromagnetic waves
of the telegraph, a new form of communication at the time. Undoubtedly, the deeply layered artistic 
expressions in Apollinaire's calligrams are not just a brilliant display
of poetic prowess from a master of the form. Each calligram itself is also
a snapshot in time, encapsulating the passion, the excitement, and the anticipation of all the 
bohemian artists of Paris, including Apollinaire, most of whom are well ahead of their time, and with their innovative work, eagerly grasping for the future.

and surrealist movements to the world, and rose to the defense 
of many young artists in the face of what was often
a xenophobic and narrow-minded public. As a poet, Apollinaire was passionate
about all forms of art and a connoisseur of medieval literature, especially calligraphy 
and illuminated initials. As a visionary, Apollinaire saw a gap
between two artistic institutions. On one side was the popular, highly 
lauded traditional art forms of the time. On the other, the forms 
of artistic expression made possible through surrealism, cubism, and new inventions, 
like the cinema and the phonograph. Within that divide, through the creation of his most important
contribution to poetry, the calligram, Guillaume Apollinaire built a bridge. Apollinaire created the calligram
as a poem picture, a written portrait, a thoughts drawing, and he used it to express his modernism and his desire to push poetry beyond
the normal bounds of text and verse and into the 20th century. Some of his calligrams are funny, like the "Lettre-Océan." Some of them are dedicated
to his young dead friends, like "La Colombe Poignardée 
et le jet d'eau." Some of them are the expression
of an emotional moment, as is "Il Pleut": "It's raining women's voices
as if they had died even in memory, and it's raining you as well,
Marvellous encounters of my life, o little drops. Those rearing clouds begin to neigh
a whole universe of auricular cities. Listen if it rains while regret
and disdain weep to an ancient music. Listen to the bonds fall off
which hold you above and below." Each calligram is intended
to allow readers to unchain themselves from the regular experience of poetry, and feel and see something new. "Lettre-Océan" is first an image to be seen
before even the words are read. Text-only elements combine with words
in shapes and forms. Two circular forms, 
one locked in a square, the other, morph beyond
the page in the shape of a spiral. Together they create a picture
that hints towards cubism. Then on closer reading of the text, the descriptive words within suggest the image of an aerial view 
of the Eiffel Tower. They give tribute to electromagnetic waves
of the telegraph, a new form of communication at the time. Undoubtedly, the deeply layered artistic 
expressions in Apollinaire's calligrams are not just a brilliant display
of poetic prowess from a master of the form. Each calligram itself is also
a snapshot in time, encapsulating the passion, the excitement, and the anticipation of all the 
bohemian artists of Paris, including Apollinaire, most of whom are well ahead of their time, and with their innovative work, eagerly grasping for the future.

Steel and plastic. These two materials are essential to so
much of our infrastructure and technology, and they have a complementary set
of strengths and weaknesses. Steel is strong and hard, but difficult to shape intricately. While plastic can take on 
just about any form, it's weak and soft. So wouldn't it be nice if there
were one material as strong as the strongest steel and as shapeable as plastic? Well, a lot of scientists 
and technologists are getting excited about a relatively
recent invention called metallic glass with both of those properties, and more. Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque,
like metals, and also like metals,
they conduct heat and electricity. But they're way stronger than most metals, which means they can withstand
a lot of force without getting bent or dented, making ultrasharp scalpels, and ultrastrong electronics cases, hinges, screws; the list goes on. Metallic glasses also 
have an incredible ability to store and release elastic energy, which makes them perfect 
for sports equipment, like tennis racquets, golf clubs, and skis. They're resistant to corrosion, and can be cast into complex shapes
with mirror-like surfaces in a single molding step. Despite their strength 
at room temperature, if you go up a few hundred 
degrees Celsius, they soften significantly, and can be deformed into
any shape you like. Cool them back down, and they regain the strength. So where do all of these wondrous
attributes come from? In essence, they have to do with
metallic glass' unique atomic structure. Most metals are crystalline as solids. That means that if you zoomed in
close enough to see the individual atoms, they'd be neatly lined up
in an orderly, repeating pattern that extends throughout 
the whole material. Ice is crystalline, and so are diamonds, and salt. If you heat these materials up enough
and melt them, the atoms can jiggle freely
and move randomly, but when you cool them back down, the atoms reorganize themselves, reestablishing the crystal. But what if you could cool 
a molten metal so fast that the atoms couldn't 
find their places again, so that the material was solid, but with the chaotic, amorphous internal
structure of a liquid? That's metallic glass. This structure has the added benefit
of lacking the grain boundaries that most metals have. Those are weak spots where the material
is more susceptible to scratches or corrosion. The first metallic glass was made
in 1960 from gold and silicon. It wasn't easy to make. Because metal atoms 
crystallize so rapidly, scientists had to cool the alloy down
incredibly fast, a million degrees Kelvin per second, by shooting tiny droplets
at cold copper plates, or spinning ultrathin ribbons. At that time, metallic glasses could
only be tens or hundreds of microns thick, which was too thin 
for most practical applications. But since then, 
scientists have figured out that if you blend several metals
that mix with each other freely, but can't easily crystallize together, usually because they have very different
atomic sizes, the mixture crystallizes much more slowly. That means you don't have to cool
it down as fast, so the material can be thicker, centimeters instead of micrometers. These materials are called bulk
metallic glasses, or BMGs. Now there are hundreds of different BMGs, so why aren't all of our bridges
and cars made out of them? Many of the BMGs currently available
are made from expensive metals, like palladium and zirconium, and they have to be really pure because any impurities 
can cause crystallization. So a BMG skyscraper or space shuttle
would be astronomically expensive. And despite their strength, they're not yet tough enough
for load-bearing applications. When the stresses get high,
they can fracture without warning, which isn't ideal for, say, a bridge. But when engineers figure out
how to make BMGs from cheaper metals, and how to make them even tougher, for these super materials, the sky's the limit.

is more susceptible to scratches or corrosion. The first metallic glass was made
in 1960 from gold and silicon. It wasn't easy to make. Because metal atoms 
crystallize so rapidly, scientists had to cool the alloy down
incredibly fast, a million degrees Kelvin per second, by shooting tiny droplets
at cold copper plates, or spinning ultrathin ribbons. At that time, metallic glasses could
only be tens or hundreds of microns thick, which was too thin 
for most practical applications. But since then, 
scientists have figured out that if you blend several metals
that mix with each other freely, but can't easily crystallize together, usually because they have very different
atomic sizes, the mixture crystallizes much more slowly. That means you don't have to cool
it down as fast, so the material can be thicker, centimeters instead of micrometers. These materials are called bulk
metallic glasses, or BMGs. Now there are hundreds of different BMGs, so why aren't all of our bridges
and cars made out of them? Many of the BMGs currently available
are made from expensive metals, like palladium and zirconium, and they have to be really pure because any impurities 
can cause crystallization. So a BMG skyscraper or space shuttle
would be astronomically expensive. And despite their strength, they're not yet tough enough
for load-bearing applications. When the stresses get high,
they can fracture without warning, which isn't ideal for, say, a bridge. But when engineers figure out
how to make BMGs from cheaper metals, and how to make them even tougher, for these super materials, the sky's the limit.

Steel and plastic. These two materials are essential to so
much of our infrastructure and technology, and they have a complementary set
of strengths and weaknesses. Steel is strong and hard, but difficult to shape intricately. While plastic can take on 
just about any form, it's weak and soft. So wouldn't it be nice if there
were one material as strong as the strongest steel and as shapeable as plastic? Well, a lot of scientists 
and technologists are getting excited about a relatively
recent invention called metallic glass with both of those properties, and more. Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque,
like metals, and also like metals,
they conduct heat and electricity. But they're way stronger than most metals, which means they can withstand
a lot of force without getting bent or dented, making ultrasharp scalpels, and ultrastrong electronics cases, hinges, screws; the list goes on. Metallic glasses also 
have an incredible ability to store and release elastic energy, which makes them perfect 
for sports equipment, like tennis racquets, golf clubs, and skis. They're resistant to corrosion, and can be cast into complex shapes
with mirror-like surfaces in a single molding step. Despite their strength 
at room temperature, if you go up a few hundred 
degrees Celsius, they soften significantly, and can be deformed into
any shape you like. Cool them back down, and they regain the strength. So where do all of these wondrous
attributes come from? In essence, they have to do with
metallic glass' unique atomic structure. Most metals are crystalline as solids. That means that if you zoomed in
close enough to see the individual atoms, they'd be neatly lined up
in an orderly, repeating pattern that extends throughout 
the whole material. Ice is crystalline, and so are diamonds, and salt. If you heat these materials up enough
and melt them, the atoms can jiggle freely
and move randomly, but when you cool them back down, the atoms reorganize themselves, reestablishing the crystal. But what if you could cool 
a molten metal so fast that the atoms couldn't 
find their places again, so that the material was solid, but with the chaotic, amorphous internal
structure of a liquid? That's metallic glass. This structure has the added benefit
of lacking the grain boundaries that most metals have. Those are weak spots where the material
is more susceptible to scratches or corrosion. The first metallic glass was made

**Transcript**:
When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions
and frightening mutations, but that's not the full story. Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray. So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry
about its effects? The answer begins with understanding
that the word radiation describes two very different 
scientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical
and magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the spectrum,
there's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Modern society is shaped by sending
and detecting electromagnetic radiation. We might download an email to our phone
via radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen
emits visible light. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other
due to their mutually positive charges. A phenomenon known as
the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact. However, some combinations
of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive. They will randomly eject matter
and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability. Nuclear radiation comes from natural
sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. Even bananas contain trace amounts
of a radioactive potassium isotope. So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects? To start, not all radiation is hazardous. Radiation becomes risky when it rips
atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion. All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy 
electromagnetic radiation is. That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet. That's why as an extra precaution
during X-rays, doctors shield body parts 
they don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen. In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation
from their use. The biggest health risk occurs
when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's
natural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death. Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources. Scientists have a harder time quantifying
these risks. Your body often repairs damage
from small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest
for a decade or more. One way scientists compare ionizing
radiation exposure is a unit called the sievert. An acute exposure to one sievert
will probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal. However, our normal daily exposures
are far lower. The average person receives 
6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more 
than 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage. And remember that banana? If you could absorb 
all the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day
to hit your annual dosage. We live in a world of radiation. However, much of that radiation
is non-ionizing. For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home
tested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce 
the associated health risks. Marie Curie, 
one of the early radiation pioneers, summed up the challenge as follows: "Nothing in life is to be feared,
it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more,
so that we may fear less."

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8: What is the name of the phenomenon that struggles to overcome the repulsion between protons in the atomic nucleus? However, the options provided do not directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the reason for nuclear radiation. Although not a perfect match, Question 8 is related to the atomic nucleus, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

However, upon closer inspection, Question 9's option A (Radon) and the correct option explanation mention unstable nuclei (isotopes), which relates to the reason for nuclear radiation.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, the closest match would be a question that addresses unstable nuclei as the reason for nuclear radiation. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would choose Question 9, as it mentions a natural source of nuclear radiation (Radon), which is related to unstable nuclei.

**Transcript**:
When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions
and frightening mutations, but that's not the full story. Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray. So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry
about its effects? The answer begins with understanding
that the word radiation describes two very different 
scientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical
and magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the spectrum,
there's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Modern society is shaped by sending
and detecting electromagnetic radiation. We might download an email to our phone
via radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen
emits visible light. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other
due to their mutually positive charges. A phenomenon known as
the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact. However, some combinations
of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive. They will randomly eject matter
and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability. Nuclear radiation comes from natural
sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. Even bananas contain trace amounts
of a radioactive potassium isotope. So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects? To start, not all radiation is hazardous. Radiation becomes risky when it rips
atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion. All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy 
electromagnetic radiation is. That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet. That's why as an extra precaution
during X-rays, doctors shield body parts 
they don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen. In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation
from their use. The biggest health risk occurs
when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's
natural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death. Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources. Scientists have a harder time quantifying
these risks. Your body often repairs damage
from small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest
for a decade or more. One way scientists compare ionizing
radiation exposure is a unit called the sievert. An acute exposure to one sievert
will probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal. However, our normal daily exposures
are far lower. The average person receives 
6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more 
than 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage. And remember that banana? If you could absorb

saint patrick was born not in ireland but in britain around a.d 35. well actually he wasn't called saint patrick at the time or even patrick but was referred to as maewyn sukkat good thing he changed his name later saint maywen's day just doesn't have the same ring we'll stick with patrick just in case i'm slaughtering that pronunciation patrick was quite far from being a saint growing up until he was 16 he considered himself a pagan or maybe even an atheist by today's definition it was at that age when he was taken into slavery by a group of irish moraiders that attacked his village patrick was sold to his master a druid chief in ireland and served him for six years it was during his captivity that he became a christian one day he heard what he described as a voice compelling him in his sleep to leave his master and find a ship that awaited him he fled to the coast of ireland and eventually made it back to his home he then decided to study in the monastery and stayed there for 12 years during which he decided that his calling was to convert the pagans to christianity eventually he adopted his christian name patricius or patrick as we now know it and returned to ireland after being appointed a bishop patrick was very successful at winning converse which upsetted the celtic druids who had him arrested several times but he managed to escape each arrest patrick traveled through ireland establishing monasteries schools and churches throughout the land eventually patrick returned to where he had once been a slave to pay his ransom to his former master despite being treated cruelly patrick didn't hold a grudge against him as patrick approached his master's old homestead to his horror he saw that it was in flames patrick found out that the stories people told about him had preceded him and in a fit of frenzy his old master gathered all his treasures into his mansion set them on fire and then threw himself into the flames an ancient record adds that his pride could not endure the thought of being vanquished by his former slave there are a lot of legends surrounding saint patrick some say that he raised people from the dead others say that he drove snakes out of ireland but since there aren't any fossil records of snakes in ireland at that time it's highly unlikely unless he drove out the fossils as well many think that snakes was a metaphor for the conversion of the pagans meaning that he drove paganism out from ireland green wasn't the original color associated with st patrick it was first blue it eventually changed for various reasons probably because of being used in various irish flags and how green is associated with ireland itself patrick worked in ireland for 30 years afterwards he retired and then died on march 17th in ad-461 there wasn't a canonization process when patrick died that didn't come up until the 12th century he would have been declared his same by acclamation and his sainthood approved by a local bishop soon after he died st patrick's day was originally a catholic holiday and still is but has also evolved into a secular holiday being celebrated by non-irish non-catholics and ironically enough even atheists today when people think of st patrick they imagine a leprechaun in a green jacket hat pipe clover and a pot of gold not a man who devoted 30 years of his life to teaching and helping the irish hopefully you now know a little more about the history of st patrick you

**Transcript**:
On first glance, this painting might not
seem terribly special, but it's actually one of the most analyzed
paintings in the history of art. It's called "Las Meninas,"
or "The Maids of Honor," painted by Diego Velázquez in 1656, and it depicts a scene in the life
of the Spanish Royal Court. A well-dressed child princess refuses
a glass of water from a handmaid, while a dwarf teases a dog. A second dwarf stands next to them, while the artist himself 
pauses at his canvas. Two more people whisper in the background, while a third appears 
to be exiting the room, and why wouldn't he when there seems
to be so little going on? Even the dog looks bored. But look more closely. The two people reflected
in the blurry mirror at the back, easily missed at first glance, are none other than
King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, seemingly changing the scene from a simple
depiction of court life to that of a royal portrait. And with this piece of information, we can begin to understand far more
about the painting and why it has captivated viewers
for centuries. First, there's the historical context. When "Las Meninas" was painted
at the end of Philip's reign, the Spanish Empire 
was in a period of decline, having suffered defeat in
The Thirty Years War, as well as economic 
and political difficulties. The King himself had also 
suffered misfortune, losing both his first wife and his only 
heir to the throne before remarrying. But the painting obscures their struggle
to provide food for their household. Even the monarch's advanced 
age is concealed through the blurring of the mirror. What we do see in the geometric center
of the canvas, brightly illuminated by the light
from the window, in the Infanta Margarita Teresa, the King's only living legitimate child
at the time. Her glowing and healthy appearance is an idealized view of the struggling
empire's future. However, the Infanta is not the only
center of the painting. Through the clever use of perspective, as well as painting the work life-sized,
on a 10.5 x 9 foot canvas, Velázquez blurs the boundary
between art and reality, creating the sense of a three-dimensional
picture that we can walk into. The line between the ceiling and the wall
converges to the open door, further creating the perception
of the painting as a physical space seen from the viewer's perspective. In this sense, the audience
and the real world are the focus, underlined by the three figures
looking straight at the viewer. But there is still another focal point. The line formed by the light fixtures
leads to the center of the back wall to the mirror reflecting the royal couple. And its positioning relative to the viewer has led to radically different 
interpretations of the entire work. The mirror could be reflecting the King
and Queen posing for their portrait, or is it reflecting the canvas? And what do we make of the fact that Velázquez never painted
the royal portrait implied here? Could the painting actually be
depicting its own creation instead? With the incorporation of the mirror
into his work, Velázquez elevated the art of painting from its perception as a simple craft to an intellectual endeavor. With its three competing center points, "Las Meninas" captures the contrast 
between the ideal, the real, and the reflected worlds, maintaining an unresolved tension
between them to tell a more complex story than any mirror can provide.

**Transcript**:
On first glance, this painting might not
seem terribly special, but it's actually one of the most analyzed
paintings in the history of art. It's called "Las Meninas,"
or "The Maids of Honor," painted by Diego Velázquez in 1656, and it depicts a scene in the life
of the Spanish Royal Court. A well-dressed child princess refuses
a glass of water from a handmaid, while a dwarf teases a dog. A second dwarf stands next to them, while the artist himself 
pauses at his canvas. Two more people whisper in the background, while a third appears 
to be exiting the room, and why wouldn't he when there seems
to be so little going on? Even the dog looks bored. But look more closely. The two people reflected
in the blurry mirror at the back, easily missed at first glance, are none other than
King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, seemingly changing the scene from a simple
depiction of court life to that of a royal portrait. And with this piece of information, we can begin to understand far more
about the painting and why it has captivated viewers
for centuries. First, there's the historical context. When "Las Meninas" was painted
at the end of Philip's reign, the Spanish Empire 
was in a period of decline, having suffered defeat in
The Thirty Years War, as well as economic 
and political difficulties. The King himself had also 
suffered misfortune, losing both his first wife and his only 
heir to the throne before remarrying. But the painting obscures their struggle
to provide food for their household. Even the monarch's advanced 
age is concealed through the blurring of the mirror. What we do see in the geometric center
of the canvas, brightly illuminated by the light
from the window, in the Infanta Margarita Teresa, the King's only living legitimate child
at the time. Her glowing and healthy appearance is an idealized view of the struggling
empire's future. However, the Infanta is not the only
center of the painting. Through the clever use of perspective, as well as painting the work life-sized,
on a 10.5 x 9 foot canvas, Velázquez blurs the boundary
between art and reality, creating the sense of a three-dimensional
picture that we can walk into. The line between the ceiling and the wall
converges to the open door, further creating the perception
of the painting as a physical space seen from the viewer's perspective. In this sense, the audience
and the real world are the focus, underlined by the three figures
looking straight at the viewer. But there is still another focal point. The line formed by the light fixtures
leads to the center of the back wall to the mirror reflecting the royal couple. And its positioning relative to the viewer has led to radically different 
interpretations of the entire work. The mirror could be reflecting the King
and Queen posing for their portrait, or is it reflecting the canvas? And what do we make of the fact that Velázquez never painted
the royal portrait implied here? Could the painting actually be
depicting its own creation instead? With the incorporation of the mirror
into his work, Velázquez elevated the art of painting from its perception as a simple craft to an intellectual endeavor. With its three competing center points, "Las Meninas" captures the contrast 
between the ideal, the real, and the reflected worlds, maintaining an unresolved tension
between them to tell a more complex story than any mirror can provide.

**Transcript**:
Scientific breakthrough, the kind that can potentially save lives, can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover, in the evolved, accumulated body of human anecdote, for example, or in the time-tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation, but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence, isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do, the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years, unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that in July of this year, Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western
Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide, and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey, but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process, we were looking, it was about three years ago, and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia, and by chance, in a previous role, I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler, who most Australians
would know is a famous naturalist, had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like, to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be, the answer was quite surprising. He said, "Take a black wetsuit, band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee, and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species." I didn't think about that much at the time, and it wasn't until the next three
fatal shark attacks happened, and it caused me to think, maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically, there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns, warning patterns, to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked, not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer, has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s, and anthropologically, Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here? Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define? We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage, particularly for attack, but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target, and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention
to the biological anecdote because that's time-tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts, the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important, passed down from generation to generation, so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior? I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence, because if science could support this concept, then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that, I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology, and a worldwide search, again, led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us, confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white, or grayscale. So I called up Nathan, a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and
mitigate the risk of shark attack, and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics, the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks, so the great white, tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand, using complex computer modeling, what that eye can see at different depths, distances, light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean. And from there, we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics: what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic, and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear, and to that end, I invited Ray Smith, a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer, and in fact the guy that designed
the original Quiksilver logo, to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that
people might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea, takes that banding idea, it's highly visible, provides a highly disruptive profile, and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food, and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front, and it's particularly better for the surface, where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit, or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit, and in any given conditions, one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially, leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration, so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew, if you wanted to stand out, you needed to look stripy, and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic, you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be, how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. (Laughter) So we have to bait the rig, because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence, and by baiting the rig, we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless, we started the testing process in January of this year, initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait, wrap it in a neoprene skin, and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark
actually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo, we can capture all the statistics
on how big the shark is, what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves, and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to
preserve the scientific method, we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the, what we call, SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting, but very encouraging, and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig, which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged, or encountered this SAMS rig, which is the Elude SAMS rig, about eight minutes before, and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it, looking for what it could
smell and sense but not see, and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more
confident than the tigers, and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig, so a black neoprene wetsuit, and going straight to the bottom, coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig, this is the banded one, where it's more tactile, it's more investigative, it's more apprehensive, and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. (Applause) So, it's important for us that all 
the testing is done independently, and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark 
Attack Mitigation Systems, we're a biotechnology licensing company, so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end, for the first time, live, worldwide -- (Laughter) — I can show you what biological adaptation, science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam, the surfer, from this side. Where are you, Sam? (Applause) And Eduardo. (Applause) Cheers, mate. Cheers. Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause) So what have we done here? Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention, we've paid attention to the biological evidence, we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence, and we've used science as a tool for translation, translation of something that was already there into something that we can 
use for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all, did the Wright brothers discover manned flight, or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically, replicate it in a way that humans could use? As for the humble wetsuit, who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time, in five years' time or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking, I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Can you imagine a party
where every movement, from the slightest gesture
to walking across the room, and every visual detail, from furniture to hemline length, were governed by a complex system
of rules and procedures? For centuries, such rituals
were commonplace for European nobility. And while they've gone out of fashion, we recognize the components
under a familiar label: ballet. Ballet, from Italian "balletto,"
or little dance, originated in Renaissance Italy
as a combination of social dance and choreographed display
at aristocratic gatherings. In many aspects, it was a way
of controlling people in court with acceptable forms of behavior, such as the manner in which people
stepped, bowed, or took someone's hand. It also involved rules governing
everything from attire to where one could walk or sit
in relation to the King. Over time, the study of ballet became
a central element of court life, and proper grasp of the etiquette could
make or break one's success as a courtier. Many of these court gestures can still
be seen in modern ballet techniques. Ballet was brought to France
in the 16th century by Catherine de' Medici, the Italian wife of King Henry II. As celebrations became more lavish,
so did the dance, with dancing masters teaching
elaborate steps to young nobles and story elements providing
a unifying theme. The focus shifted from participation
to performance, and the form acquired 
more theatrical trappings, such as professionally designed sets and a slightly raised platform or stage
with curtains and wings. But it was in the 17th century court
of Louis XIV that ballet was refined into the art
we know today. Louis himself had been trained
in ballet from childhood. His early role as the sun god
Apollo at age fifteen cemented the central role ballet
would play during his reign. It also earned him the title
of Sun King, with his splendid golden costume
and choreography that promoted the idea of the king
as a divinely ordained ruler. Louis would go on to perform
80 roles in 40 major ballets, either as a majestic lead, or sometimes playing minor 
or comedic parts before emerging in the lead role
as the end. He trained daily in ballet, as well as fencing and riding, and through his example, dancing became an essential skill
for all gentlemen of the era. But Louis XIV's main contribution 
to ballet was not as a performer. His founding of 
the Royal Academy of Dance in 1661 shifted control of ballet
from local guilds to the royal court. As director, he appointed his personal ballet master 
and frequent performance partner Pierre Beauchamp, who codified the five main positions 
of the body still used today. Through is collaborations
with Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Royal Music Academy, and famed playwright Molière, Beauchamp helped establish ballet
as a grand spectacle. And in 1669, a separate ballet academy
was founded. The Paris Opera Ballet survives today
as the oldest ballet company in the world. Ballet moved away from the royal court
to the theater and survived the democratic revolutions
and reforms that followed over the next century. With the advent of the romantic movement, fantasy and folklore themes 
became common motifs. And though the influence of ballet
in France would decline, other countries, such as Russia, would play a major role 
in its further development. Fortunately, today most of us don't
have to learn a complicated set of steps just to socialize at a wedding. Instead, we can go to the theater
to see professionals who spend their lives training rigorously to perform feats that would have been
unimagineable in Louis XIV's day.

**Transcript**:
Can you imagine a party
where every movement, from the slightest gesture
to walking across the room, and every visual detail, from furniture to hemline length, were governed by a complex system
of rules and procedures? For centuries, such rituals
were commonplace for European nobility. And while they've gone out of fashion, we recognize the components
under a familiar label: ballet. Ballet, from Italian "balletto,"
or little dance, originated in Renaissance Italy
as a combination of social dance and choreographed display
at aristocratic gatherings. In many aspects, it was a way
of controlling people in court with acceptable forms of behavior, such as the manner in which people
stepped, bowed, or took someone's hand. It also involved rules governing
everything from attire to where one could walk or sit
in relation to the King. Over time, the study of ballet became
a central element of court life, and proper grasp of the etiquette could
make or break one's success as a courtier. Many of these court gestures can still
be seen in modern ballet techniques. Ballet was brought to France
in the 16th century by Catherine de' Medici, the Italian wife of King Henry II. As celebrations became more lavish,
so did the dance, with dancing masters teaching
elaborate steps to young nobles and story elements providing
a unifying theme. The focus shifted from participation
to performance, and the form acquired 
more theatrical trappings, such as professionally designed sets and a slightly raised platform or stage
with curtains and wings. But it was in the 17th century court
of Louis XIV that ballet was refined into the art
we know today. Louis himself had been trained
in ballet from childhood. His early role as the sun god
Apollo at age fifteen cemented the central role ballet
would play during his reign. It also earned him the title
of Sun King, with his splendid golden costume
and choreography that promoted the idea of the king
as a divinely ordained ruler. Louis would go on to perform
80 roles in 40 major ballets, either as a majestic lead, or sometimes playing minor 
or comedic parts before emerging in the lead role
as the end. He trained daily in ballet, as well as fencing and riding, and through his example, dancing became an essential skill
for all gentlemen of the era. But Louis XIV's main contribution 
to ballet was not as a performer. His founding of 
the Royal Academy of Dance in 1661 shifted control of ballet
from local guilds to the royal court. As director, he appointed his personal ballet master 
and frequent performance partner Pierre Beauchamp, who codified the five main positions 
of the body still used today. Through is collaborations
with Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Royal Music Academy, and famed playwright Molière, Beauchamp helped establish ballet
as a grand spectacle. And in 1669, a separate ballet academy
was founded. The Paris Opera Ballet survives today
as the oldest ballet company in the world. Ballet moved away from the royal court
to the theater and survived the democratic revolutions
and reforms that followed over the next century. With the advent of the romantic movement, fantasy and folklore themes 
became common motifs. And though the influence of ballet
in France would decline, other countries, such as Russia, would play a major role 
in its further development. Fortunately, today most of us don't

**Transcript**:
So you're stranded in a huge rainforest,
and you've eaten a poisonous mushroom. To save your life, you need the antidote
excreted by a certain species of frog. Unfortunately, only the female 
of the species produces the antidote, and to make matters worse, the male and female occur in equal
numbers and look identical, with no way for you to tell them apart, except that the male 
has a distinctive croak. And it may just be your lucky day. To your left, you've spotted a frog
on a tree stump, but before you start running to it, you're startled by the croak
of a male frog coming from a clearing 
in the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one 
made the sound. You feel yourself starting 
to lose consciousness, and realize you only have time to go
in one direction before you collapse. What are your chances of survival
if you head for the clearing and lick both of the frogs there? What about if you go to the tree stump? Which way should you go? Press pause now
to calculate odds yourself. 3 2 1 If you chose to go to the clearing,
you're right, but the hard part is correctly 
calculating your odds. There are two common incorrect ways
of solving this problem. Wrong answer number one: Assuming there's a roughly equal
number of males and females, the probability of any one frog being
either sex is one in two, which is 0.5, or 50%. And since all frogs are independent
of each other, the chance of any one of them being female
should still be 50% each time you choose. This logic actually is correct 
for the tree stump, but not for the clearing. Wrong answer two: First, you saw two frogs in the clearing. Now you've learned that at least
one of them is male, but what are the chances that both are? If the probability of each individual frog
being male is 0.5, then multiplying the two together
will give you 0.25, which is one in four, or 25%. So, you have a 75% chance 
of getting at least one female and receiving the antidote. So here's the right answer. Going for the clearing gives you
a two in three chance of survival, or about 67%. If you're wondering how this 
could possibly be right, it's because of something called
conditional probability. Let's see how it unfolds. When we first see the two frogs, there are several possible combinations
of male and female. If we write out the full list, we have what mathematicians call
the sample space, and as we can see, out of the four possible combinations,
only one has two males. So why was the answer of 75% wrong? Because the croak gives 
us additional information. As soon as we know 
that one of the frogs is male, that tells us there can't be 
a pair of females, which means we can eliminate
that possibility from the sample space, leaving us with 
three possible combinations. Of them, one still has two males, giving us our two in three,
or 67% chance of getting a female. This is how conditional probability works. You start off with a large sample space
that includes every possibility. But every additional piece of information
allows you to eliminate possibilities, shrinking the sample space and increasing the probability 
of getting a particular combination. The point is that information
affects probability. And conditional probability isn't just
the stuff of abstract mathematical games. It pops up in the real world, as well. Computers and other devices use
conditional probability to detect likely errors in the strings
of 1's and 0's that all our data consists of. And in many of our own life decisions, we use information gained from 
past experience and our surroundings to narrow down our choices
to the best options so that maybe next time, we can avoid eating that poisonous 
mushroom in the first place.

**Transcript**:
So you're stranded in a huge rainforest,
and you've eaten a poisonous mushroom. To save your life, you need the antidote
excreted by a certain species of frog. Unfortunately, only the female 
of the species produces the antidote, and to make matters worse, the male and female occur in equal
numbers and look identical, with no way for you to tell them apart, except that the male 
has a distinctive croak. And it may just be your lucky day. To your left, you've spotted a frog
on a tree stump, but before you start running to it, you're startled by the croak
of a male frog coming from a clearing 
in the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one 
made the sound. You feel yourself starting 
to lose consciousness, and realize you only have time to go
in one direction before you collapse. What are your chances of survival
if you head for the clearing and lick both of the frogs there? What about if you go to the tree stump? Which way should you go? Press pause now
to calculate odds yourself. 3 2 1 If you chose to go to the clearing,
you're right, but the hard part is correctly 
calculating your odds. There are two common incorrect ways
of solving this problem. Wrong answer number one: Assuming there's a roughly equal
number of males and females, the probability of any one frog being
either sex is one in two, which is 0.5, or 50%. And since all frogs are independent
of each other, the chance of any one of them being female
should still be 50% each time you choose. This logic actually is correct 
for the tree stump, but not for the clearing. Wrong answer two: First, you saw two frogs in the clearing. Now you've learned that at least
one of them is male, but what are the chances that both are? If the probability of each individual frog
being male is 0.5, then multiplying the two together
will give you 0.25, which is one in four, or 25%. So, you have a 75% chance 
of getting at least one female and receiving the antidote. So here's the right answer. Going for the clearing gives you
a two in three chance of survival, or about 67%. If you're wondering how this 
could possibly be right, it's because of something called
conditional probability. Let's see how it unfolds. When we first see the two frogs, there are several possible combinations
of male and female. If we write out the full list, we have what mathematicians call
the sample space, and as we can see, out of the four possible combinations,
only one has two males. So why was the answer of 75% wrong? Because the croak gives 
us additional information. As soon as we know 
that one of the frogs is male, that tells us there can't be 
a pair of females, which means we can eliminate
that possibility from the sample space, leaving us with 
three possible combinations. Of them, one still has two males, giving us our two in three,
or 67% chance of getting a female. This is how conditional probability works. You start off with a large sample space
that includes every possibility. But every additional piece of information
allows you to eliminate possibilities, shrinking the sample space and increasing the probability 
of getting a particular combination. The point is that information
affects probability. And conditional probability isn't just
the stuff of abstract mathematical games. It pops up in the real world, as well. Computers and other devices use
conditional probability to detect likely errors in the strings
of 1's and 0's that all our data consists of. And in many of our own life decisions, we use information gained from 
past experience and our surroundings to narrow down our choices
to the best options so that maybe next time, we can avoid eating that poisonous 
mushroom in the first place.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: How many possible combinations of male and female frogs are there in the clearing? Options: A. 2, B. 3, C. 4, D. 5**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options. But among the given options, it is the closest one.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the probability of both frogs being female, which is not present in the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match.

If I had to choose a question that matches the probability aspect, I would say that **Question 7: What is the probability of finding a female frog in the clearing after the croak of the male frog is heard? Options: A. 25%, B. 50%, C. 67%, D. 75%** is a close match, but it does not ask about the probability of both frogs being female.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **6** (with some caveats as mentioned above).

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the concept and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the probability of the frog on the left being female, given that the frog on the right is definitely male. This scenario is similar to the original problem, but with a different condition.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match in terms of intent and concept. It asks about the probability of finding a female frog in the clearing after the croak of the male frog is heard. Although the condition is different (the croak of the male frog vs. the frog on the right being definitely male), the underlying concept of conditional probability is the same.

However, please note that the options and the specific scenario in Question 7 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match, but with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

Index: 7 (with reservations)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine a police lineup
where ten witnesses are asked to identify a bank robber
they glimpsed fleeing the crime scene. If six of them pick out the same person, there's a good chance 
that's the real culprit, and if all ten make the same choice, you might think the case is rock solid, but you'd be wrong. For most of us, 
this sounds pretty strange. After all, much of our society
relies on majority vote and consensus, whether it's politics, business, or entertainment. So it's natural to think
that more consensus is a good thing. And up until a certain point, 
it usually is. But sometimes, the closer you start to get
to total agreement, the less reliable the result becomes. This is called the paradox of unanimity. The key to understanding 
this apparent paradox is in considering the overall level 
of uncertainty involved in the type of situation 
you're dealing with. If we asked witnesses to identify
the apple in this lineup, for example, we shouldn't be surprised 
by a unanimous verdict. But in cases where we have 
reason to expect some natural variance, we should also expect varied distribution. If you toss a coin one hundred times, you would expect to get heads
somewhere around 50% of the time. But if your results started 
to approach 100% heads, you'd suspect that something was wrong, not with your individual flips, but with the coin itself. Of course, suspect identifications aren't
as random as coin tosses, but they're not as clear cut 
as telling apples from bananas, either. In fact, a 1994 study found 
that up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong 
person out of a lineup, even when many 
are confident in their choice. Memory based on short glimpses
can be unreliable, and we often overestimate 
our own accuracy. Knowing all this, a unanimous identification starts to seem
less like certain guilt, and more like a systemic error, or bias in the lineup. And systemic errors don't just appear
in matters of human judgement. From 1993-2008, the same female DNA was found 
in multiple crime scenes around Europe, incriminating an elusive killer
dubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn. But the DNA evidence was so consistent
precisely because it was wrong. It turned out that the cotton swabs
used to collect the DNA samples had all been accidentally contaminated
by a woman working in the swab factory. In other cases, systematic errors arise
through deliberate fraud, like the presidential referendum held
by Saddam Hussein in 2002, which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters
with all 100% supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term. When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually
all that paradoxical. Unanimous agreement 
is still theoretically ideal, especially in cases when you'd expect very
low odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where 
perfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there's probably
some hidden factor affecting the system. Although we may strive for harmony
and consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement
should be naturally expected. And if a perfect result seems too good
to be true, it probably is.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Consider a bank robber fleeing from a bank and jumping into a car. Twenty witnesses on the sidewalk get a fleeting glimpse of the man for about 10 seconds each. Three days later, during a police lineup all 20 witnesses agree the same suspect is the bank robber. What is the likelihood they have correctly identified the criminal?
Options: A. No chance, B. Unlikely, C. 50:50, D. Very likely
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why might a unanimous identification of a suspect by witnesses be less reliable than expected?
Options: A. Because witnesses are always unreliable., B. Because the suspect is likely to be innocent., C. Because a unanimous decision may indicate a systemic error or bias in the lineup., D. Because the witnesses are not confident in their choice.
Correct Option: None

low odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where 
perfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there's probably
some hidden factor affecting the system. Although we may strive for harmony
and consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement
should be naturally expected. And if a perfect result seems too good
to be true, it probably is.

**Transcript**:
The human brain is one of the most
sophisticated organs in the world, a supercomputer made of billions
of neurons that processes and controls all
of our senses, thoughts, and actions. But there was something Charles Darwin
found even more impressive: the brain of an ant, which he called one of the most
marvelous atoms of matter in the world. If you find it hard to believe that
something so tiny could have a complex brain, you're not alone. In his project to classify and describe
all living things, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus
assumed insects had no brains at all. He was wrong, but understandably so. Insect brains are not only miniscule, but in many respects, 
they function differently than our own. One of the most noticeable differences is that an insect that loses its head
can still walk, scratch itself, breathe, and even fly. This is because while our nervous system
works like a monarchy, with the brain calling the shots, the insect nervous system works
more like a decentralized federation. Many insect activities,
like walking or breathing, are coordinated by clusters of neurons,
also known as ganglia, along their bodies. Together with the brain, these local 
ganglia form the insect nervous system. While an insect can do a lot with just
its local ganglia, the brain is still crucial 
for its survival. An insect's brain lets it perceive
the world through sight and smell. It also chooses suitable mates, remembers locations of food sources
and hives, regulates communication, and even coordinates navigation
over huge distances. And this vast diversity of behaviors is controlled by an organ 
the size of the head of a pin, with less than one million neurons, compared to our 86 billion. But even though the insect brain
is organized very differently from ours, there are some striking similarities. For example, most insects have
smell detectors on their antennae, similar to those found in human noses. And our primary olfactory brain regions
look and function rather similarly, with clusters of neurons activated
and deactivated in precise timing to code for specific scents. Scientists have been astonished
by these similarities because insects and humans are not
very closely related. In fact, our last common ancestor
was a simple worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million
years ago. So how did we end up
with such similar brain structures when our evolution took almost
entirely different paths? Scientists call this phenomenon
convergent evolution. It's the same principle behind birds,
bats, and bees separately evolving wings. Similar selective pressures can cause
natural selection to favor the same evolutionary strategy in species with vastly different 
evolutionary pasts. By studying the comparison between
insect and human brains, scientists can thus understand which of
our brain functions are unique, and which are general solutions 
to evolutionary problems. But this is not the only reason scientists
are fascinated by insect brains. Their small size and simplicity makes it 
easier to understand exactly how neurons work together 
in the brain. This is also valuable for engineers, who study the insect brain to help design
control systems for everything from self-flying airplanes
to tiny search-and-rescue roach bots. So, size and complexity are not always
the most impressive things. The next time you try to swat a fly, take a moment to marvel at the efficiency
of its tiny nervous system as it outsmarts your fancy brain.

very closely related. In fact, our last common ancestor
was a simple worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million
years ago. So how did we end up
with such similar brain structures when our evolution took almost
entirely different paths? Scientists call this phenomenon
convergent evolution. It's the same principle behind birds,
bats, and bees separately evolving wings. Similar selective pressures can cause
natural selection to favor the same evolutionary strategy in species with vastly different 
evolutionary pasts. By studying the comparison between
insect and human brains, scientists can thus understand which of
our brain functions are unique, and which are general solutions 
to evolutionary problems. But this is not the only reason scientists
are fascinated by insect brains. Their small size and simplicity makes it 
easier to understand exactly how neurons work together 
in the brain. This is also valuable for engineers, who study the insect brain to help design
control systems for everything from self-flying airplanes
to tiny search-and-rescue roach bots. So, size and complexity are not always
the most impressive things. The next time you try to swat a fly, take a moment to marvel at the efficiency
of its tiny nervous system as it outsmarts your fancy brain.

**Transcript**:
The human brain is one of the most
sophisticated organs in the world, a supercomputer made of billions
of neurons that processes and controls all
of our senses, thoughts, and actions. But there was something Charles Darwin
found even more impressive: the brain of an ant, which he called one of the most
marvelous atoms of matter in the world. If you find it hard to believe that
something so tiny could have a complex brain, you're not alone. In his project to classify and describe
all living things, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus
assumed insects had no brains at all. He was wrong, but understandably so. Insect brains are not only miniscule, but in many respects, 
they function differently than our own. One of the most noticeable differences is that an insect that loses its head
can still walk, scratch itself, breathe, and even fly. This is because while our nervous system
works like a monarchy, with the brain calling the shots, the insect nervous system works
more like a decentralized federation. Many insect activities,
like walking or breathing, are coordinated by clusters of neurons,
also known as ganglia, along their bodies. Together with the brain, these local 
ganglia form the insect nervous system. While an insect can do a lot with just
its local ganglia, the brain is still crucial 
for its survival. An insect's brain lets it perceive
the world through sight and smell. It also chooses suitable mates, remembers locations of food sources
and hives, regulates communication, and even coordinates navigation
over huge distances. And this vast diversity of behaviors is controlled by an organ 
the size of the head of a pin, with less than one million neurons, compared to our 86 billion. But even though the insect brain
is organized very differently from ours, there are some striking similarities. For example, most insects have
smell detectors on their antennae, similar to those found in human noses. And our primary olfactory brain regions
look and function rather similarly, with clusters of neurons activated
and deactivated in precise timing to code for specific scents. Scientists have been astonished
by these similarities because insects and humans are not
very closely related. In fact, our last common ancestor
was a simple worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million
years ago. So how did we end up
with such similar brain structures when our evolution took almost
entirely different paths? Scientists call this phenomenon
convergent evolution. It's the same principle behind birds,
bats, and bees separately evolving wings. Similar selective pressures can cause
natural selection to favor the same evolutionary strategy in species with vastly different 
evolutionary pasts. By studying the comparison between

**Transcript**:
So you see a few cubes sitting in an art gallery, and you think to yourself, "This is the greatest hoax that anyone has ever pulled off." You immediately walk away, discouraged by the wide gulf between what you hope for when you walk into a museum and what they've presented to you. How did we get here? How could these cubes that the artist didn't even make with their own hands be important? This is the case for minimalism. First off, we're not talking about minimalism as a general sensibility
or the life-changing magic of tidying up. We're talking about the art of a particular moment in time. Namely, the 1960s, when all of a sudden,
there was a lot of geometric, abstract art. Some of it was painting by artists
like Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but most of it was sculpture by artists like Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Anne Truitt, Robert Morris, Tony Smith,
Ronald Bladen, and Sol LeWitt. Art critics called it ABC art, object art, primary structures, and cool art, but the term minimalism prevailed. These artists never called their art minimalist, by the way, nor did they like the term, or the implication that the work
was so reductive that it was minimally art. But minimalism was a rejection of what came before. Specifically, abstract expressionism, which dominated the art market in the 1950s. These new artists wanted to remove expression completely, remove emotion, empty the work of idiosyncratic gesture, make it resistant to biographical reading. Their hard-edged, basic shapes and forms avoided allusion, metaphor, and overt symbolism. The forms were often repeated, one thing after another in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements, rejecting compositional balancing. No artist hemming and hawing over the canvas here. The objects were impersonal, many of them machine-made, fabricated from new and industrial materials. Sometimes this entailed ready-made units, like Andre's bricks, or Flavin's fluorescent tubes. They didn't want you to ooh and ah,
or admire the handling of paint. As LeWitt once said, "It is best that the basic unit "be deliberately uninteresting." Robert Morris wrote that he could
hear a resounding no at the time. "No to transcendence and spiritual values, "heroic scale, anguished decisions, "historicizing narrative, valuable artifact, "intelligent structure, interesting visual experience." But what they were saying yes to
was a new and startling realness. Abandoning the pedestal to dismantle
the separation between you and the art. Judd claimed these works are neither painting nor sculpture, but instead specific objects occupying real space. These objects aren't pointing to anything
or referencing anything. Andre called his work a kind of plastic poetry, in which elements are combined to produce space. So there is no illusion of space, it just is space. Minimalism had its haters from the start. In 1967, art critic Michael Fried
attacked the work for being theatrical. For him it was an object in a room
that had presence before a viewer, but it did not have what good art has, which is presentness, or, "an instant of aesthetic experience "which occurs in no real space or time at all." But Fried really just ended up affirming
exactly what the artists were trying to do: proving how radical it really was. Despite its detractors, minimalism became all the rage. This geometric, unadorned style flowed throughout the worlds of fashion, theater, and design. In short, it was cool. And then because these artists were never trying to be minimalist to begin with, they moved on to other things
and other kinds of art had its day. But minimalism changed things. For centuries, art had been trying to trick you, convince you that the hunk of rock
was something other than a hunk of rock. But not this. You feel like there's gotta be some secret to it, but there isn't. There's nothing to interpret. This is what it is. It wasn't supposed to look like art of the past, and it wasn't supposed to function like it either. With minimalism, meaning doesn't rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context,
and exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art
can still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery
as you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room
shapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate.

**Transcript**:
So you see a few cubes sitting in an art gallery, and you think to yourself, "This is the greatest hoax that anyone has ever pulled off." You immediately walk away, discouraged by the wide gulf between what you hope for when you walk into a museum and what they've presented to you. How did we get here? How could these cubes that the artist didn't even make with their own hands be important? This is the case for minimalism. First off, we're not talking about minimalism as a general sensibility
or the life-changing magic of tidying up. We're talking about the art of a particular moment in time. Namely, the 1960s, when all of a sudden,
there was a lot of geometric, abstract art. Some of it was painting by artists
like Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but most of it was sculpture by artists like Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Anne Truitt, Robert Morris, Tony Smith,
Ronald Bladen, and Sol LeWitt. Art critics called it ABC art, object art, primary structures, and cool art, but the term minimalism prevailed. These artists never called their art minimalist, by the way, nor did they like the term, or the implication that the work
was so reductive that it was minimally art. But minimalism was a rejection of what came before. Specifically, abstract expressionism, which dominated the art market in the 1950s. These new artists wanted to remove expression completely, remove emotion, empty the work of idiosyncratic gesture, make it resistant to biographical reading. Their hard-edged, basic shapes and forms avoided allusion, metaphor, and overt symbolism. The forms were often repeated, one thing after another in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements, rejecting compositional balancing. No artist hemming and hawing over the canvas here. The objects were impersonal, many of them machine-made, fabricated from new and industrial materials. Sometimes this entailed ready-made units, like Andre's bricks, or Flavin's fluorescent tubes. They didn't want you to ooh and ah,
or admire the handling of paint. As LeWitt once said, "It is best that the basic unit "be deliberately uninteresting." Robert Morris wrote that he could
hear a resounding no at the time. "No to transcendence and spiritual values, "heroic scale, anguished decisions, "historicizing narrative, valuable artifact, "intelligent structure, interesting visual experience." But what they were saying yes to
was a new and startling realness. Abandoning the pedestal to dismantle
the separation between you and the art. Judd claimed these works are neither painting nor sculpture, but instead specific objects occupying real space. These objects aren't pointing to anything
or referencing anything. Andre called his work a kind of plastic poetry, in which elements are combined to produce space. So there is no illusion of space, it just is space. Minimalism had its haters from the start. In 1967, art critic Michael Fried
attacked the work for being theatrical. For him it was an object in a room
that had presence before a viewer, but it did not have what good art has, which is presentness, or, "an instant of aesthetic experience "which occurs in no real space or time at all." But Fried really just ended up affirming
exactly what the artists were trying to do: proving how radical it really was. Despite its detractors, minimalism became all the rage. This geometric, unadorned style flowed throughout the worlds of fashion, theater, and design. In short, it was cool. And then because these artists were never trying to be minimalist to begin with, they moved on to other things
and other kinds of art had its day. But minimalism changed things. For centuries, art had been trying to trick you, convince you that the hunk of rock
was something other than a hunk of rock. But not this. You feel like there's gotta be some secret to it, but there isn't. There's nothing to interpret. This is what it is. It wasn't supposed to look like art of the past, and it wasn't supposed to function like it either. With minimalism, meaning doesn't rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context,
and exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art
can still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery
as you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room
shapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum
of natural history. Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t
there because you need them but because your animal ancestors did.
No longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared,
these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by
natural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your
thumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up.
If you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle
in your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris
longus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing
on one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though.
There’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that
surgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.
You can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those
that use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer
in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a
lot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look
at the three that are attached to our outer ear.
We can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our
mammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds.
Presumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals.
In humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes.
In one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response
to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable.
And you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from
a speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying
(and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial
body parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to
our body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin
to form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised
hair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm.
Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures,
and it’s also part of the fight or flight response.
So it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened.
And it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps.
And then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some
people have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone.
It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our
ancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one
point. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans
embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates.
And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae.
In many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail.
But in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks
after they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the
ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until
they’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s
a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from
the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior. These babies are only 1 month old and you
can see that their inner monkey can support their entire weight.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: According to this video, how is the Palmaris Longus currently most useful?
Options: A. In replacing tendons during reconstructive or cosmetic surgery, B. In helping humans grip things more tightly

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum
of natural history. Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t
there because you need them but because your animal ancestors did.
No longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared,
these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by
natural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your
thumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up.
If you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle
in your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris
longus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing
on one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though.
There’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that
surgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.
You can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those
that use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer
in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a
lot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look
at the three that are attached to our outer ear.
We can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our
mammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds.
Presumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals.
In humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes.
In one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response
to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable.
And you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from
a speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying
(and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial
body parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to
our body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin
to form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised
hair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm.
Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures,
and it’s also part of the fight or flight response.
So it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened.
And it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps.
And then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some
people have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone.
It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our
ancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one
point. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans
embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates.
And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae.
In many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail.
But in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks
after they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the
ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until
they’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s
a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from
the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior. These babies are only 1 month old and you
can see that their inner monkey can support their entire weight.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum
of natural history. Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t
there because you need them but because your animal ancestors did.
No longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared,
these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by
natural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your
thumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up.
If you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle
in your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris
longus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing
on one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though.
There’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that
surgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.
You can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those
that use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer
in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a
lot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look
at the three that are attached to our outer ear.
We can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our
mammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds.
Presumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals.
In humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes.
In one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response
to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable.
And you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from
a speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying
(and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial
body parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to
our body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin
to form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised
hair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm.
Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day.
Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures,
and it’s also part of the fight or flight response.
So it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened.
And it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps.
And then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some
people have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone.
It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our
ancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one
point. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans
embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates.
And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae.
In many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail.
But in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks
after they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the
ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until
they’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s
a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from
the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior. These babies are only 1 month old and you
can see that their inner monkey can support their entire weight.

**Transcript**:
The story of the Buddha’s life, like all
of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century
B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then
called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy
man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called The four noble
truths The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble
eightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of
the importance of facing suffering directly. We must do our best to liberate ourselves
from the grip of our own desires, and recognise that suffering can be viewed
as part of our common connection with others, spurring us to compassion and gentleness.

**Transcript**:
The story of the Buddha’s life, like all
of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century
B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then
called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy
man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called The four noble
truths The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble
eightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of
the importance of facing suffering directly. We must do our best to liberate ourselves
from the grip of our own desires, and recognise that suffering can be viewed
as part of our common connection with others, spurring us to compassion and gentleness.

**Transcript**:
The story of the Buddha’s life, like all
of Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century
B.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then
called Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy
man. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted
him to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:
jewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected
from the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick
man, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them
to the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate
people represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day
touch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth
trip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual
life in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the
palace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding
all physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him
solace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a
small boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for
the tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He
ate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the
flames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,
“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of
creation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how
to best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating
compassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha
described a path to transcending suffering called The four noble
truths The first noble truth is the realisation that
first prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction
in the world. The second is that this suffering is caused
by our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering
by removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have
enough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting
our mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles
or use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now
term a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions
and states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into
generosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha
uncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble
eightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects
of behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right
action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion
that wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler
impulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding
is only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers
collected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide
followers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during
the Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon
in India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,
meditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian
king named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across
Asia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main
schools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and
a half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and
seeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are
important regardless of our spiritual identification. Like the Buddha, we are all born into the
world not realising how much suffering it contains, and unable to fully comprehend that
misfortune, sickness, and death will come to us too. As we grow older, this reality often feels
overwhelming, and we may seek to avoid it altogether. But the Buddha’s teachings remind us of

**Transcript**:
Almost 2000 years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca peered 
at his book through a glass of water. Suddenly, the text below was transformed. The words magically became clear. But it wasn't until a millennium later
that that same principle would be used to create 
the earliest glasses. Today, glasses can help millions of people
with poor vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The key to understanding what that means
lies with the term refraction, the ability of a transparent medium,
like glass, water, or the eye to change the direction
of light passing through it. The eye has two main refractive surfaces: the cornea and the lens. Ideally, these surfaces work together to refract light in a way that accurately
focuses light onto the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue
at the back of the eye that works with the brain
to give rise to vision. But many people develop refractive errors, either during childhood 
as their eyes are growing, or in later life as their eyes age. Imperfections in the cornea and lens cause refracted light to be focused
in front of or behind the retina, making images appear blurry. People with refractive errors
can still see color, movement, and light, but the details of what they're looking at
are out of focus. People experience refractive 
errors in different ways, owing to differences in their eyes. In some, light refracts too much, and in others, too little. Eyes with a focal point 
in front of the retina are called myopic, or short-sighted. They can see close objects clearly, but those far away are out of focus. But when the focus point 
is behind the retina, people are hyperopic,
or long-sighted. For them, objects close up
are unfocused, but distant objects are crystal clear. Finally, some people have a cornea
with a non-spherical shape that causes astigmatism, a form of out-of-focus vision
that makes all objects seem blurred, whether close or far. As we age, our eyes face new challenges. When we're young, the lens of the eye
is flexible and can change shape to bring
images into focus, something called accommodation. This keeps objects in focus when we
shift our gaze from far to near. But as we get older, the lens becomes
less flexible, and can't change shape when we want
to look at near objects. This is called presbyopia, and it affects adults starting
around the age of 40 years. Myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Each of these is a refractive error. Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses
or contact lenses, which work by refocusing light
so it strikes the retina precisely. It's even possible to correct vision
with surgery using lasers that change the shape
of the cornea and alter its refractive properties. But glasses remain the most popular. By using carefully crafted lenses to steer light to exactly 
the right spot on the retina, a person's clear vision can be restored. We've come a long way 
since Seneca's discovery and the crude glasses of yesteryear. In 1727, a British optician named
Edward Scarlett developed the modern style of glasses which are kept in place with arms
which hook over each ear. Today's glasses take their inspiration
from that design, but they're also much more precise
and personal. Each pair is tailored for an individual
to bring out their unique powers of sight. So if you're one of the 500 million people
with a problem with close or far vision, or both, there's a pair of glasses out there
waiting to reveal a whole new world that's hiding in plain view.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 7, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 8
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Almost 2000 years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca peered 
at his book through a glass of water. Suddenly, the text below was transformed. The words magically became clear. But it wasn't until a millennium later
that that same principle would be used to create 
the earliest glasses. Today, glasses can help millions of people
with poor vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The key to understanding what that means
lies with the term refraction, the ability of a transparent medium,
like glass, water, or the eye to change the direction
of light passing through it. The eye has two main refractive surfaces: the cornea and the lens. Ideally, these surfaces work together to refract light in a way that accurately
focuses light onto the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue
at the back of the eye that works with the brain
to give rise to vision. But many people develop refractive errors, either during childhood 
as their eyes are growing, or in later life as their eyes age. Imperfections in the cornea and lens cause refracted light to be focused
in front of or behind the retina, making images appear blurry. People with refractive errors
can still see color, movement, and light, but the details of what they're looking at
are out of focus. People experience refractive 
errors in different ways, owing to differences in their eyes. In some, light refracts too much, and in others, too little. Eyes with a focal point 
in front of the retina are called myopic, or short-sighted. They can see close objects clearly, but those far away are out of focus. But when the focus point 
is behind the retina, people are hyperopic,
or long-sighted. For them, objects close up
are unfocused, but distant objects are crystal clear. Finally, some people have a cornea
with a non-spherical shape that causes astigmatism, a form of out-of-focus vision
that makes all objects seem blurred, whether close or far. As we age, our eyes face new challenges. When we're young, the lens of the eye
is flexible and can change shape to bring
images into focus, something called accommodation. This keeps objects in focus when we
shift our gaze from far to near. But as we get older, the lens becomes
less flexible, and can't change shape when we want
to look at near objects. This is called presbyopia, and it affects adults starting
around the age of 40 years. Myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Each of these is a refractive error. Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses
or contact lenses, which work by refocusing light
so it strikes the retina precisely. It's even possible to correct vision
with surgery using lasers that change the shape
of the cornea and alter its refractive properties. But glasses remain the most popular. By using carefully crafted lenses to steer light to exactly 
the right spot on the retina, a person's clear vision can be restored. We've come a long way 
since Seneca's discovery and the crude glasses of yesteryear. In 1727, a British optician named
Edward Scarlett developed the modern style of glasses which are kept in place with arms
which hook over each ear. Today's glasses take their inspiration
from that design, but they're also much more precise
and personal. Each pair is tailored for an individual
to bring out their unique powers of sight. So if you're one of the 500 million people
with a problem with close or far vision, or both, there's a pair of glasses out there
waiting to reveal a whole new world that's hiding in plain view.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks 
like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled
by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over
and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties
of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons, you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain, and trillions of connections between
all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated
system like that on, it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things 
like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task
over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron
in the brain is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity, feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits
described earlier. And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.

**Transcript**:
How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain
give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have
the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of
sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, 
fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because
they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit 
complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out
as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader
is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly
twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks 
like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually
just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close
to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on
the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,
something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish 
is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own
unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled
by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish
following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over
and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean
to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many
complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which
millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same
basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes
in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties
of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices
that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it
by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step
to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish
to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain 
to individual neurons, you're left with something that is
notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about
right now isn't reliant on a single neuron
lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from
the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons 
in the human brain, and trillions of connections between
all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated
system like that on, it could behave in all sorts
of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow
simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity
self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things 
like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task
over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits
that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules 
when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron
in the brain is to either excite or inhibit
other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together
into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns
of activity, feedback loops that ramp up
or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons
can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns 
of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting
in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity
cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits
described earlier. And yet, from this chaos,
patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again
in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent
patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying
their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena
at vastly different scales is that same remarkable
characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require
someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into
the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium
that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons
that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and
economies of our cities across the planet.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your rich, eccentric uncle 
just passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have
been invited to the reading of his will. He wanted to leave 
all of his money to you, but he knew that if he did,
your relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything 
you need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following 
note in his will: "I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together,
you will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find
the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance 
all to yourself. Good luck." The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives
to a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number
from 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then 
close every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status
of every third locker, specifically if it's open, 
she'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until
all 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain
open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start
down the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer
you know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number
of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors
in the locker number. For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 
are the factors of 6. So when a locker has an even number
of factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open. Most of the lockers 
have an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors
naturally pair up. In fact, the only lockers that have
an odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when
multiplied by itself equals the number. For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it. 3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once. Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open. You know that these ten lockers 
are the solution, so you open them immediately
and read the words inside: "The code is the first five lockers
touched only twice." You realize that the only lockers 
touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. So the code is 2-3-5-7-11. The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance. Too bad your relatives were always
too busy being nasty to each other to pay attention 
to your eccentric uncle's riddles.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your rich, eccentric uncle 
just passed away, and you and your 99 nasty relatives have
been invited to the reading of his will. He wanted to leave 
all of his money to you, but he knew that if he did,
your relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything 
you need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following 
note in his will: "I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together,
you will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find
the pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance 
all to yourself. Good luck." The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives
to a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number
from 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then 
close every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status
of every third locker, specifically if it's open, 
she'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until
all 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain
open at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start
down the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer
you know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number
of times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors
in the locker number. For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 
are the factors of 6. So when a locker has an even number
of factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open. Most of the lockers 
have an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors
naturally pair up. In fact, the only lockers that have
an odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when
multiplied by itself equals the number. For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it. 3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once. Therefore, every locker that is 
a perfect square will remain open. You know that these ten lockers 
are the solution, so you open them immediately
and read the words inside: "The code is the first five lockers
touched only twice." You realize that the only lockers 
touched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. So the code is 2-3-5-7-11. The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance. Too bad your relatives were always
too busy being nasty to each other to pay attention

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Many of the inanimate objects around you
probably seem perfectly still. But look deep into the atomic structure
of any of them, and you'll see a world in constant flux. Stretching, contracting, springing, jittering, drifting atoms everywhere. And though that movement may seem chaotic,
it's not random. Atoms that are bonded together, and that describes almost all substances, move according to a set of principles. For example, take molecules,
atoms held together by covalent bonds. There are three basic ways 
molecules can move: rotation, translation, and vibration. Rotation and translation 
move a molecule in space while its atoms stay 
the same distance apart. Vibration, on the other hand, 
changes those distances, actually altering the molecule's shape. For any molecule, you can count up
the number of different ways it can move. That corresponds to 
its degrees of freedom, which in the context of mechanics basically means the number of variables
we need to take into account to understand the full system. Three-dimensional space is defined by
x, y, and z axes. Translation allows the molecule to move
in the direction of any of them. That's three degrees of freedom. It can also rotate around 
any of these three axes. That's three more, unless it's a linear molecule, 
like carbon dioxide. There, one of the rotations just spins
the molecule around its own axis, which doesn't count because it doesn't
change the position of the atoms. Vibration is where it gets a bit tricky. Let's take a simple molecule,
like hydrogen. The length of the bond that holds the two
atoms together is constantly changing as if the atoms were connected 
by a spring. That change in distance is tiny,
less than a billionth of a meter. The more atoms and bonds a molecule has,
the more vibrational modes. For example, a water molecule 
has three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogens,
and two bonds. That gives it three modes of vibration: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. More complicated molecules have even
fancier vibrational modes, like rocking, wagging, and twisting. If you know how many atoms a molecule has,
you can count its vibrational modes. Start with the total degrees of freedom, which is three times the number
of atoms in the molecule. That's because each atom can move
in three different directions. Three of the total correspond 
to translation when all the atoms 
are going in the same direction. And three, or two for linear molecules,
correspond to rotations. All the rest, 3N-6
or 3N-5 for linear molecules, are vibrations. So what's causing all this motion? Molecules move because they absorb
energy from their surroundings, mainly in the form of heat
or electromagnetic radiation. When this energy gets transferred
to the molecules, they vibrate, rotate, or translate faster. Faster motion increases the kinetic energy
of the molecules and atoms. We define this as an increase 
in temperature and thermal energy. This is the phenomenon your microwave oven
uses to heat your food. The oven emits microwave radiation,
which is absorbed by the molecules, especially those of water. They move around faster and faster, bumping into each other and increasing
the food's temperature and thermal energy. The greenhouse effect is another example. Some of the solar radiation 
that hits the Earth's surface is reflected back to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like water vapor
and carbon dioxide absorb this radiation and speed up. These hotter, faster-moving molecules
emit infrared radiation in all directions, including back to Earth, warming it. Does all this molecular motion ever stop? You might think that would happen
at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. No one's ever managed to cool
anything down that much, but even if we could, molecules would still move due to
a quantum mechanical principle called zero-point energy. In other words, everything has been moving
since the universe's very first moments, and will keep going long, 
long after we're gone.

the molecule around its own axis, which doesn't count because it doesn't
change the position of the atoms. Vibration is where it gets a bit tricky. Let's take a simple molecule,
like hydrogen. The length of the bond that holds the two
atoms together is constantly changing as if the atoms were connected 
by a spring. That change in distance is tiny,
less than a billionth of a meter. The more atoms and bonds a molecule has,
the more vibrational modes. For example, a water molecule 
has three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogens,
and two bonds. That gives it three modes of vibration: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. More complicated molecules have even
fancier vibrational modes, like rocking, wagging, and twisting. If you know how many atoms a molecule has,
you can count its vibrational modes. Start with the total degrees of freedom, which is three times the number
of atoms in the molecule. That's because each atom can move
in three different directions. Three of the total correspond 
to translation when all the atoms 
are going in the same direction. And three, or two for linear molecules,
correspond to rotations. All the rest, 3N-6
or 3N-5 for linear molecules, are vibrations. So what's causing all this motion? Molecules move because they absorb
energy from their surroundings, mainly in the form of heat
or electromagnetic radiation. When this energy gets transferred
to the molecules, they vibrate, rotate, or translate faster. Faster motion increases the kinetic energy
of the molecules and atoms. We define this as an increase 
in temperature and thermal energy. This is the phenomenon your microwave oven
uses to heat your food. The oven emits microwave radiation,
which is absorbed by the molecules, especially those of water. They move around faster and faster, bumping into each other and increasing
the food's temperature and thermal energy. The greenhouse effect is another example. Some of the solar radiation 
that hits the Earth's surface is reflected back to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like water vapor
and carbon dioxide absorb this radiation and speed up. These hotter, faster-moving molecules
emit infrared radiation in all directions, including back to Earth, warming it. Does all this molecular motion ever stop? You might think that would happen
at absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. No one's ever managed to cool
anything down that much, but even if we could, molecules would still move due to
a quantum mechanical principle called zero-point energy. In other words, everything has been moving
since the universe's very first moments, and will keep going long, 
long after we're gone.

**Transcript**:
Many of the inanimate objects around you
probably seem perfectly still. But look deep into the atomic structure
of any of them, and you'll see a world in constant flux. Stretching, contracting, springing, jittering, drifting atoms everywhere. And though that movement may seem chaotic,
it's not random. Atoms that are bonded together, and that describes almost all substances, move according to a set of principles. For example, take molecules,
atoms held together by covalent bonds. There are three basic ways 
molecules can move: rotation, translation, and vibration. Rotation and translation 
move a molecule in space while its atoms stay 
the same distance apart. Vibration, on the other hand, 
changes those distances, actually altering the molecule's shape. For any molecule, you can count up
the number of different ways it can move. That corresponds to 
its degrees of freedom, which in the context of mechanics basically means the number of variables
we need to take into account to understand the full system. Three-dimensional space is defined by
x, y, and z axes. Translation allows the molecule to move
in the direction of any of them. That's three degrees of freedom. It can also rotate around

Harry Houdini was without doubt the most famous and talented Illusionist to ever walk the earth few performers have captured the Public's imagination like Houdini did and even today over a hundred years later his legacy continues to live on so here are five things you may not have known about this magnificent showman Houdini escapes from seemingly impossible situations thrilled audiences but his obsession for Perfection and extreme motivation in his prce practice often wasn't seen by his fans in order to perform his mind-blowing stuns Houdini had to train intensely both physically and mentally he trained himself to be ambidextrous making his left hand as able as his right he was said to practice untying knots with his toes so much so that his toes had the dexterity of his fingers he would swallow large objects and regurgitate them back up again he practiced slight of hand and misdirection in front of a large mirror for hours and hours at a time and his practice sessions were so constant that he would frequently forget to eat change and even bathe of course all this dedication consumed most of his time meaning there was hardly time to sleep 4 hours a night was said to be a lion for Houdini but if in his short hours of sleep he did awake with an idea for a new stun or trick there was always a notebook by his bedside in order for him to write it down he even had a large sunken bathtub installed in his house where he could practice his breath holds and would fill it with ice in order to prepare his body for his handcuffed free ing River plunges he built himself into the man he wanted to become and you can't help but respect every ounce of that his bizarre interest in the maab he would study murder cases and used to enjoy performing to inmates on death row he even bought a device that would eventually kill the men he was performing for a real electric chair which was used to kill inmates on death row at the Sing Sing prison he was also very interested in life after death he would visit hundreds of mediums and spiritual GTO togethers in an attempt to to contact his deceased mother who he loved dearly but of course he couldn't just turn up to a seance unnoticed so he would disguise himself with a hat and a fake beard Houdini later said that all mediums were conmen and wrote this in an article in the 25 years of my investigation and the hundreds of seances which I've attended I have never seen or heard anything that could convince me that there is a possibility of communications with the loved ones who have gone beyond despite saying this Houdini still believed in the afterlife he just wasn't convinced that communication was possible Houdini's imaginary son now it's unsure why Houdini and his wife of 32 years Bess didn't have children some say Bess was unable to carry and others say that Houdini was x-rayed many times by his brother who was remarkably New York's first x-ray specialist and the constant exposure to radiation made Houdini sterile but just because they couldn't have a child it didn't mean they couldn't invent one yep they invented a son and he was called mayor Samuel Houdini named after Harry's father while Harry was away he would write letters to Bess asking how his son was getting on and what he'd been up to Bess would let Harry know that mayor was doing well the final letters written about their son was that he was doing well and had now become the president of the United States now lots of people say that they were both just nuts but I see it as a cute way to bring each other closer together and help brighten the fact that he couldn't have children Houdini was killed by one of his own fans Harry died of peritonitis secondary to a ruptured appendix on October the 31st Halloween in 1926 he was aged just 52 his insurance company concluded that the death was due to him being punched in the stomach by a university student called Jay Gordon Whitehead Whitehead was witnessed delivering several heavy blows to Houdini's stomach before he had the chance to prepare after the incident Houdini continued performing his upcoming show in a great deal of pain the pain lasted for 2 days and when he finally visited a doctor he was told he had a fever and acute appendicitis he was advised to have immediate surgery but Houdini being so dedicated to his craft ignored the advice and decided to go on with another show when Houdini arrived at the Garrick theater in Detroit Michigan on October the 24th 1926 for what would be his last performance he had a fever of 104 and must have felt awful but despite this he took to the stage he was reported to have passed out during the show but was revived and continued to perform afterwards he was hospitalized at Detroit's Grace Hospital where he died shortly after his last words were said to be I am weaker I guess I have lost the fight the Houdini paranormal ritual despite Houdini not seeing any firsthand proof of communication with the afterlife he certainly believed in life after death and always told his wife B that if he died he would attempt to communicate with her if he was able to do so he gave her a secret code that if she heard being whispered one day or if a spiritualist said the secret code was coming through during a seance Bess would know it was her husband every Halloween Bess would haul a seance in an attempt to contact him but after 10 years with no success she gave up incredibly though the Seance still continues to this day every year on October the 31st a group of spiritualists hold a ritual in an attempt to communicate with Houdini unfortunately communication with him hasn't yet been successful so that's five little known facts about the most famous escape artist who has ever lived thanks for watching and catch you next week for another video

Harry Houdini was without doubt the most famous and talented Illusionist to ever walk the earth few performers have captured the Public's imagination like Houdini did and even today over a hundred

his obsession for Perfection and extreme motivation in his prce practice often wasn't seen by his fans in order to perform his mind-blowing stuns Houdini had to train intensely both physically and mentally he trained himself to be ambidextrous making his left hand as able as his right he was said to practice untying knots with his toes so much so that his toes had the dexterity of his fingers he would swallow large objects and regurgitate them back up again he practiced slight of hand and misdirection in front of a large mirror for hours and hours at a time and his practice sessions were so constant that he would frequently forget to eat change and even bathe of course all this dedication consumed most of his time meaning there was hardly time to sleep 4 hours a night was said to be a lion for Houdini but if in his short hours of sleep he did awake with an idea for a new stun or trick there was always a notebook by his bedside in order for him to write it down he even had a large sunken bathtub installed in his house where he could practice his breath holds and would fill it with ice in order to prepare his body for his handcuffed free ing River plunges he built himself into the man he wanted to become and you can't help but respect every ounce of that his bizarre interest in the maab he would study murder cases and used to enjoy performing to inmates on death row he even bought a device that would eventually kill the men he was performing for a real electric chair which was used to kill inmates on death row at the Sing Sing prison he was also very interested in life after death he would visit hundreds of mediums and spiritual GTO togethers in an attempt to to contact his deceased mother who he loved dearly but of course he couldn't just turn up to a seance unnoticed so he would disguise himself with a hat and a fake beard Houdini later said that all mediums were conmen and wrote this in an article in the 25 years of my investigation and the hundreds of seances which I've attended I have never seen or heard anything that could convince me that there is a possibility of communications with the loved ones who have gone beyond despite saying this Houdini still believed in the afterlife he just wasn't convinced that communication was possible Houdini's imaginary son now it's unsure why Houdini and his wife of 32 years Bess didn't have children some say Bess was unable to carry and others say that Houdini was x-rayed many times by his brother who was remarkably New York's first x-ray specialist and the constant exposure to radiation made Houdini sterile but just because they couldn't have a child it didn't mean they couldn't invent one yep they invented a son and he was called mayor Samuel Houdini named after Harry's father while Harry was away he would write letters to Bess asking how his son was getting on and what he'd been up to Bess would let Harry know that mayor was doing well the final letters written about their son was that he was doing well and had now become the president of the United States now lots of people say that they were both just nuts but I see it as a cute way to bring each other closer together and help brighten the fact that he couldn't have children Houdini was killed by one of his own fans Harry died of peritonitis secondary to a ruptured appendix on October the 31st Halloween in 1926 he was aged just 52 his insurance company concluded that the death was due to him being punched in the stomach by a university student called Jay Gordon Whitehead Whitehead was witnessed delivering several heavy blows to Houdini's stomach before he had the chance to prepare after the incident Houdini continued performing his upcoming show in a great deal of pain the pain lasted for 2 days and when he finally visited a doctor he was told he had a fever and acute appendicitis he was advised to have immediate surgery but Houdini being so dedicated to his craft ignored the advice and decided to go on

**Transcript**:
In the third act of "Swan Lake," the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly
endless series of turns, bobbing up and down on one pointed foot and spinning around, and around,
and around 32 times. It's one of the toughest sequences
in ballet, and for those thirty seconds or so, she's like a human top 
in perpetual motion. Those spectacular turns
are called fouettés, which means "whipped" in French, describing the dancer's incredible
ability to whip around without stopping. But while we're marveling at the fouetté,
can we unravel its physics? The dancer starts the fouetté by pushing
off with her foot to generate torque. But the hard part 
is maintaining the rotation. As she turns, friction between her pointe shoe 
and the floor, and somewhat between her body and the air, reduces her momentum. So how does she keep turning? Between each turn, the dancer pauses
for a split second and faces the audience. Her supporting foot flattens, and then twists as it rises 
back onto pointe, pushing against the floor to generate
a tiny amount of new torque. At the same time, her arms sweep open
to help her keep her balance. The turns are most effective if her center
of gravity stays constant, and a skilled dancer will be able to keep
her turning axis vertical. The extended arms 
and torque-generating foot both help drive the fouetté. But the real secret and the reason
you hardly notice the pause is that her other leg never stops moving. During her momentary pause, the dancer's elevated leg straightens
and moves from the front to the side, before it folds back into her knee. By staying in motion, that leg is storing
some of the momentum of the turn. When the leg comes back in 
towards the body, that stored momentum gets transferred
back to the dancer's body, propelling her around as she rises
back onto pointe. As the ballerina extends and retracts
her leg with each turn, momentum travels back and forth
between leg and body, keeping her in motion. A really good ballerina can get more
than one turn out of every leg extension in one of two ways. First, she can extend her leg sooner. The longer the leg is extended,
the more momentum it stores, and the more momentum it can return
to the body when it's pulled back in. More angular momentum means
she can make more turns before needing to replenish
what was lost to friction. The other option is for the dancer to bring her arms 
or leg in closer to her body once she returns to pointe. Why does this work? Like every other turn in ballet, the fouetté is governed 
by angular momentum, which is equal to the dancer's angular
velocity times her rotational inertia. And except for what's lost to friction, that angular momentum has to stay
constant while the dancer is on pointe. That's called conservation
of angular momentum. Now, rotational inertia can be thought of as a body's resistance 
to rotational motion. It increases when more mass is distributed
further from the axis of rotation, and decreases when the mass is distributed
closer to the axis of rotation. So as she brings her arms closer
to her body, her rotational inertia shrinks. In order to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity,
the speed of her turn, has to increase, allowing the same amount 
of stored momentum to carry her through multiple turns. You've probably seen ice skaters
do the same thing, spinning faster and faster
by drawing in their arms and legs. In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Black Swan
is a sorceress, and her 32 captivating fouettés do seem
almost supernatural. But it's not magic that 
makes them possible. It's physics.

to rotational motion. It increases when more mass is distributed
further from the axis of rotation, and decreases when the mass is distributed
closer to the axis of rotation. So as she brings her arms closer
to her body, her rotational inertia shrinks. In order to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity,
the speed of her turn, has to increase, allowing the same amount 
of stored momentum to carry her through multiple turns. You've probably seen ice skaters
do the same thing, spinning faster and faster
by drawing in their arms and legs. In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Black Swan
is a sorceress, and her 32 captivating fouettés do seem
almost supernatural. But it's not magic that 
makes them possible. It's physics.

**Transcript**:
In the third act of "Swan Lake," the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly
endless series of turns, bobbing up and down on one pointed foot and spinning around, and around,
and around 32 times. It's one of the toughest sequences
in ballet, and for those thirty seconds or so, she's like a human top 
in perpetual motion. Those spectacular turns
are called fouettés, which means "whipped" in French, describing the dancer's incredible
ability to whip around without stopping. But while we're marveling at the fouetté,
can we unravel its physics? The dancer starts the fouetté by pushing
off with her foot to generate torque. But the hard part 
is maintaining the rotation. As she turns, friction between her pointe shoe 
and the floor, and somewhat between her body and the air, reduces her momentum. So how does she keep turning? Between each turn, the dancer pauses
for a split second and faces the audience. Her supporting foot flattens, and then twists as it rises 
back onto pointe, pushing against the floor to generate
a tiny amount of new torque. At the same time, her arms sweep open
to help her keep her balance. The turns are most effective if her center
of gravity stays constant, and a skilled dancer will be able to keep
her turning axis vertical. The extended arms 
and torque-generating foot both help drive the fouetté. But the real secret and the reason
you hardly notice the pause is that her other leg never stops moving. During her momentary pause, the dancer's elevated leg straightens
and moves from the front to the side, before it folds back into her knee. By staying in motion, that leg is storing
some of the momentum of the turn. When the leg comes back in 
towards the body, that stored momentum gets transferred
back to the dancer's body, propelling her around as she rises
back onto pointe. As the ballerina extends and retracts
her leg with each turn, momentum travels back and forth
between leg and body, keeping her in motion. A really good ballerina can get more
than one turn out of every leg extension in one of two ways. First, she can extend her leg sooner. The longer the leg is extended,
the more momentum it stores, and the more momentum it can return
to the body when it's pulled back in. More angular momentum means
she can make more turns before needing to replenish
what was lost to friction. The other option is for the dancer to bring her arms 
or leg in closer to her body once she returns to pointe. Why does this work? Like every other turn in ballet, the fouetté is governed 
by angular momentum, which is equal to the dancer's angular
velocity times her rotational inertia. And except for what's lost to friction, that angular momentum has to stay
constant while the dancer is on pointe. That's called conservation
of angular momentum. Now, rotational inertia can be thought of as a body's resistance 
to rotational motion. It increases when more mass is distributed
further from the axis of rotation, and decreases when the mass is distributed
closer to the axis of rotation. So as she brings her arms closer

**Transcript**:
Among the great poets of literary history, certain names like Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Whitman are instantly recognizable. However, there's an early 20th century
great French poet whose name you may not know: Guillaume Apollinaire. He was a close friend and collaborator
of artists like Picasso, Rousseau, and Chagall. He coined the term surrealism, and he was even suspected of stealing
the Mona Lisa in 1911. During his short lifetime, he created poetry that combined
text and image in a way that seemingly predicted
an artistic revolution to come. In the late 19th 
and early 20th century Paris, the low-rent districts of Montmartre
and Montparnasse were home to every 
kind of starving artist. It was all they could afford. These painters, writers, 
and intellectuals, united in their artistic passion
and counterculture beliefs, made up France's bohemian subculture. And their works of art, literature,
and intellect would shake up the world. At the turn of the 20th century, within this dynamic scene, art critic, poet, 
and champion of the avant-garde, Guillaume Apollinaire 
was a well-known fixture. As an art critic, Apollinaire explained the cubist 
and surrealist movements to the world, and rose to the defense 
of many young artists in the face of what was often
a xenophobic and narrow-minded public. As a poet, Apollinaire was passionate
about all forms of art and a connoisseur of medieval literature, especially calligraphy 
and illuminated initials. As a visionary, Apollinaire saw a gap
between two artistic institutions. On one side was the popular, highly 
lauded traditional art forms of the time. On the other, the forms 
of artistic expression made possible through surrealism, cubism, and new inventions, 
like the cinema and the phonograph. Within that divide, through the creation of his most important
contribution to poetry, the calligram, Guillaume Apollinaire built a bridge. Apollinaire created the calligram
as a poem picture, a written portrait, a thoughts drawing, and he used it to express his modernism and his desire to push poetry beyond
the normal bounds of text and verse and into the 20th century. Some of his calligrams are funny, like the "Lettre-Océan." Some of them are dedicated
to his young dead friends, like "La Colombe Poignardée 
et le jet d'eau." Some of them are the expression
of an emotional moment, as is "Il Pleut": "It's raining women's voices
as if they had died even in memory, and it's raining you as well,
Marvellous encounters of my life, o little drops. Those rearing clouds begin to neigh
a whole universe of auricular cities. Listen if it rains while regret
and disdain weep to an ancient music. Listen to the bonds fall off
which hold you above and below." Each calligram is intended
to allow readers to unchain themselves from the regular experience of poetry, and feel and see something new. "Lettre-Océan" is first an image to be seen
before even the words are read. Text-only elements combine with words
in shapes and forms. Two circular forms, 
one locked in a square, the other, morph beyond
the page in the shape of a spiral. Together they create a picture
that hints towards cubism. Then on closer reading of the text, the descriptive words within suggest the image of an aerial view 
of the Eiffel Tower. They give tribute to electromagnetic waves
of the telegraph, a new form of communication at the time. Undoubtedly, the deeply layered artistic 
expressions in Apollinaire's calligrams are not just a brilliant display
of poetic prowess from a master of the form. Each calligram itself is also
a snapshot in time, encapsulating the passion, the excitement, and the anticipation of all the 
bohemian artists of Paris, including Apollinaire, most of whom are well ahead of their time, and with their innovative work, eagerly grasping for the future.

and champion of the avant-garde, Guillaume Apollinaire 
was a well-known fixture. As an art critic, Apollinaire explained the cubist 
and surrealist movements to the world, and rose to the defense 
of many young artists in the face of what was often
a xenophobic and narrow-minded public. As a poet, Apollinaire was passionate
about all forms of art and a connoisseur of medieval literature, especially calligraphy 
and illuminated initials. As a visionary, Apollinaire saw a gap
between two artistic institutions. On one side was the popular, highly 
lauded traditional art forms of the time. On the other, the forms 
of artistic expression made possible through surrealism, cubism, and new inventions, 
like the cinema and the phonograph. Within that divide, through the creation of his most important
contribution to poetry, the calligram, Guillaume Apollinaire built a bridge. Apollinaire created the calligram
as a poem picture, a written portrait, a thoughts drawing, and he used it to express his modernism and his desire to push poetry beyond
the normal bounds of text and verse and into the 20th century. Some of his calligrams are funny, like the "Lettre-Océan." Some of them are dedicated
to his young dead friends, like "La Colombe Poignardée 
et le jet d'eau." Some of them are the expression
of an emotional moment, as is "Il Pleut": "It's raining women's voices
as if they had died even in memory, and it's raining you as well,
Marvellous encounters of my life, o little drops. Those rearing clouds begin to neigh
a whole universe of auricular cities. Listen if it rains while regret
and disdain weep to an ancient music. Listen to the bonds fall off
which hold you above and below." Each calligram is intended
to allow readers to unchain themselves from the regular experience of poetry, and feel and see something new. "Lettre-Océan" is first an image to be seen
before even the words are read. Text-only elements combine with words
in shapes and forms. Two circular forms, 
one locked in a square, the other, morph beyond
the page in the shape of a spiral. Together they create a picture
that hints towards cubism. Then on closer reading of the text, the descriptive words within suggest the image of an aerial view 
of the Eiffel Tower. They give tribute to electromagnetic waves
of the telegraph, a new form of communication at the time. Undoubtedly, the deeply layered artistic 
expressions in Apollinaire's calligrams are not just a brilliant display
of poetic prowess from a master of the form. Each calligram itself is also
a snapshot in time, encapsulating the passion, the excitement, and the anticipation of all the 
bohemian artists of Paris, including Apollinaire, most of whom are well ahead of their time, and with their innovative work, eagerly grasping for the future.

**Transcript**:
Among the great poets of literary history, certain names like Homer, Shakespeare, Milton, and Whitman are instantly recognizable. However, there's an early 20th century
great French poet whose name you may not know: Guillaume Apollinaire. He was a close friend and collaborator
of artists like Picasso, Rousseau, and Chagall. He coined the term surrealism, and he was even suspected of stealing
the Mona Lisa in 1911. During his short lifetime, he created poetry that combined
text and image in a way that seemingly predicted
an artistic revolution to come. In the late 19th 
and early 20th century Paris, the low-rent districts of Montmartre
and Montparnasse were home to every 
kind of starving artist. It was all they could afford. These painters, writers, 
and intellectuals, united in their artistic passion
and counterculture beliefs, made up France's bohemian subculture. And their works of art, literature,
and intellect would shake up the world. At the turn of the 20th century, within this dynamic scene, art critic, poet, 
and champion of the avant-garde, Guillaume Apollinaire 
was a well-known fixture. As an art critic, Apollinaire explained the cubist 
and surrealist movements to the world, and rose to the defense 
of many young artists in the face of what was often

**Transcript**:
Steel and plastic. These two materials are essential to so
much of our infrastructure and technology, and they have a complementary set
of strengths and weaknesses. Steel is strong and hard, but difficult to shape intricately. While plastic can take on 
just about any form, it's weak and soft. So wouldn't it be nice if there
were one material as strong as the strongest steel and as shapeable as plastic? Well, a lot of scientists 
and technologists are getting excited about a relatively
recent invention called metallic glass with both of those properties, and more. Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque,
like metals, and also like metals,
they conduct heat and electricity. But they're way stronger than most metals, which means they can withstand
a lot of force without getting bent or dented, making ultrasharp scalpels, and ultrastrong electronics cases, hinges, screws; the list goes on. Metallic glasses also 
have an incredible ability to store and release elastic energy, which makes them perfect 
for sports equipment, like tennis racquets, golf clubs, and skis. They're resistant to corrosion, and can be cast into complex shapes
with mirror-like surfaces in a single molding step. Despite their strength 
at room temperature, if you go up a few hundred 
degrees Celsius, they soften significantly, and can be deformed into
any shape you like. Cool them back down, and they regain the strength. So where do all of these wondrous
attributes come from? In essence, they have to do with
metallic glass' unique atomic structure. Most metals are crystalline as solids. That means that if you zoomed in
close enough to see the individual atoms, they'd be neatly lined up
in an orderly, repeating pattern that extends throughout 
the whole material. Ice is crystalline, and so are diamonds, and salt. If you heat these materials up enough
and melt them, the atoms can jiggle freely
and move randomly, but when you cool them back down, the atoms reorganize themselves, reestablishing the crystal. But what if you could cool 
a molten metal so fast that the atoms couldn't 
find their places again, so that the material was solid, but with the chaotic, amorphous internal
structure of a liquid? That's metallic glass. This structure has the added benefit
of lacking the grain boundaries that most metals have. Those are weak spots where the material
is more susceptible to scratches or corrosion. The first metallic glass was made
in 1960 from gold and silicon. It wasn't easy to make. Because metal atoms 
crystallize so rapidly, scientists had to cool the alloy down
incredibly fast, a million degrees Kelvin per second, by shooting tiny droplets
at cold copper plates, or spinning ultrathin ribbons. At that time, metallic glasses could
only be tens or hundreds of microns thick, which was too thin 
for most practical applications. But since then, 
scientists have figured out that if you blend several metals
that mix with each other freely, but can't easily crystallize together, usually because they have very different
atomic sizes, the mixture crystallizes much more slowly. That means you don't have to cool
it down as fast, so the material can be thicker, centimeters instead of micrometers. These materials are called bulk
metallic glasses, or BMGs. Now there are hundreds of different BMGs, so why aren't all of our bridges
and cars made out of them? Many of the BMGs currently available
are made from expensive metals, like palladium and zirconium, and they have to be really pure because any impurities 
can cause crystallization. So a BMG skyscraper or space shuttle
would be astronomically expensive. And despite their strength, they're not yet tough enough
for load-bearing applications. When the stresses get high,
they can fracture without warning, which isn't ideal for, say, a bridge. But when engineers figure out
how to make BMGs from cheaper metals, and how to make them even tougher, for these super materials, the sky's the limit.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the key structural difference between metallic glasses and metals in general?
Options: A. Most metals are crystalline whereas metallic glasses have disordered atomic structure, B. Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity whereas metallic glasses are not, C.

**Transcript**:
Steel and plastic. These two materials are essential to so
much of our infrastructure and technology, and they have a complementary set
of strengths and weaknesses. Steel is strong and hard, but difficult to shape intricately. While plastic can take on 
just about any form, it's weak and soft. So wouldn't it be nice if there
were one material as strong as the strongest steel and as shapeable as plastic? Well, a lot of scientists 
and technologists are getting excited about a relatively
recent invention called metallic glass with both of those properties, and more. Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque,
like metals, and also like metals,
they conduct heat and electricity. But they're way stronger than most metals, which means they can withstand
a lot of force without getting bent or dented, making ultrasharp scalpels, and ultrastrong electronics cases, hinges, screws; the list goes on. Metallic glasses also 
have an incredible ability to store and release elastic energy, which makes them perfect 
for sports equipment, like tennis racquets, golf clubs, and skis. They're resistant to corrosion, and can be cast into complex shapes
with mirror-like surfaces in a single molding step. Despite their strength 
at room temperature, if you go up a few hundred 
degrees Celsius, they soften significantly, and can be deformed into
any shape you like. Cool them back down, and they regain the strength. So where do all of these wondrous
attributes come from? In essence, they have to do with
metallic glass' unique atomic structure. Most metals are crystalline as solids. That means that if you zoomed in
close enough to see the individual atoms, they'd be neatly lined up
in an orderly, repeating pattern that extends throughout 
the whole material. Ice is crystalline, and so are diamonds, and salt. If you heat these materials up enough
and melt them, the atoms can jiggle freely
and move randomly, but when you cool them back down, the atoms reorganize themselves, reestablishing the crystal. But what if you could cool 
a molten metal so fast that the atoms couldn't 
find their places again, so that the material was solid, but with the chaotic, amorphous internal
structure of a liquid? That's metallic glass. This structure has the added benefit
of lacking the grain boundaries that most metals have. Those are weak spots where the material
is more susceptible to scratches or corrosion. The first metallic glass was made
in 1960 from gold and silicon. It wasn't easy to make. Because metal atoms 
crystallize so rapidly, scientists had to cool the alloy down
incredibly fast, a million degrees Kelvin per second, by shooting tiny droplets
at cold copper plates, or spinning ultrathin ribbons. At that time, metallic glasses could
only be tens or hundreds of microns thick, which was too thin 
for most practical applications. But since then, 
scientists have figured out that if you blend several metals
that mix with each other freely, but can't easily crystallize together, usually because they have very different
atomic sizes, the mixture crystallizes much more slowly. That means you don't have to cool
it down as fast, so the material can be thicker, centimeters instead of micrometers. These materials are called bulk
metallic glasses, or BMGs. Now there are hundreds of different BMGs, so why aren't all of our bridges
and cars made out of them? Many of the BMGs currently available
are made from expensive metals, like palladium and zirconium, and they have to be really pure because any impurities 
can cause crystallization. So a BMG skyscraper or space shuttle
would be astronomically expensive. And despite their strength, they're not yet tough enough
for load-bearing applications. When the stresses get high,
they can fracture without warning, which isn't ideal for, say, a bridge. But when engineers figure out
how to make BMGs from cheaper metals, and how to make them even tougher, for these super materials, the sky's the limit.

**Transcript**:
When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions
and frightening mutations, but that's not the full story. Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray. So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry
about its effects? The answer begins with understanding
that the word radiation describes two very different 
scientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical
and magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the spectrum,
there's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Modern society is shaped by sending
and detecting electromagnetic radiation. We might download an email to our phone
via radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen
emits visible light. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other
due to their mutually positive charges. A phenomenon known as
the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact. However, some combinations
of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive. They will randomly eject matter
and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability. Nuclear radiation comes from natural
sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. Even bananas contain trace amounts
of a radioactive potassium isotope. So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects? To start, not all radiation is hazardous. Radiation becomes risky when it rips
atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion. All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy 
electromagnetic radiation is. That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet. That's why as an extra precaution
during X-rays, doctors shield body parts 
they don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen. In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation
from their use. The biggest health risk occurs
when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's
natural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death. Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources. Scientists have a harder time quantifying
these risks. Your body often repairs damage
from small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest
for a decade or more. One way scientists compare ionizing
radiation exposure is a unit called the sievert. An acute exposure to one sievert
will probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal. However, our normal daily exposures
are far lower. The average person receives 
6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more 
than 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage. And remember that banana? If you could absorb 
all the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day
to hit your annual dosage. We live in a world of radiation. However, much of that radiation
is non-ionizing. For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home
tested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce 
the associated health risks. Marie Curie, 
one of the early radiation pioneers, summed up the challenge as follows: "Nothing in life is to be feared,
it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more,
so that we may fear less."

via radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen
emits visible light. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other
due to their mutually positive charges. A phenomenon known as
the strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact. However, some combinations
of protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive. They will randomly eject matter
and/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability. Nuclear radiation comes from natural
sources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. We also refine naturally occurring
radioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. Even bananas contain trace amounts
of a radioactive potassium isotope. So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects? To start, not all radiation is hazardous. Radiation becomes risky when it rips
atoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost
or gained electrons is called an ion. All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy 
electromagnetic radiation is. That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet. That's why as an extra precaution
during X-rays, doctors shield body parts 
they don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen. In comparison, cell phones and microwaves
operate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation
from their use. The biggest health risk occurs
when lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's
natural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death. Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels
of ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources. Scientists have a harder time quantifying
these risks. Your body often repairs damage
from small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest
for a decade or more. One way scientists compare ionizing
radiation exposure is a unit called the sievert. An acute exposure to one sievert
will probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal. However, our normal daily exposures
are far lower. The average person receives 
6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more 
than 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage. And remember that banana? If you could absorb 
all the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day
to hit your annual dosage. We live in a world of radiation. However, much of that radiation
is non-ionizing. For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home
tested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce 
the associated health risks. Marie Curie, 
one of the early radiation pioneers, summed up the challenge as follows: "Nothing in life is to be feared,
it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more,
so that we may fear less."

**Transcript**:
When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions
and frightening mutations, but that's not the full story. Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray. So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry
about its effects? The answer begins with understanding
that the word radiation describes two very different 
scientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical
and magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the spectrum,
there's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Modern society is shaped by sending
and detecting electromagnetic radiation. We might download an email to our phone

**Transcript**:
saint patrick was born not in ireland but in britain around a.d 35. well actually he wasn't called saint patrick at the time or even patrick but was referred to as maewyn sukkat good thing he changed his name later saint maywen's day just doesn't have the same ring we'll stick with patrick just in case i'm slaughtering that pronunciation patrick was quite far from being a saint growing up until he was 16 he considered himself a pagan or maybe even an atheist by today's definition it was at that age when he was taken into slavery by a group of irish moraiders that attacked his village patrick was sold to his master a druid chief in ireland and served him for six years it was during his captivity that he became a christian one day he heard what he described as a voice compelling him in his sleep to leave his master and find a ship that awaited him he fled to the coast of ireland and eventually made it back to his home he then decided to study in the monastery and stayed there for 12 years during which he decided that his calling was to convert the pagans to christianity eventually he adopted his christian name patricius or patrick as we now know it and returned to ireland after being appointed a bishop patrick was very successful at winning converse which upsetted the celtic druids who had him arrested several times but he managed to escape each arrest patrick traveled through ireland establishing monasteries schools and churches throughout the land eventually patrick returned to where he had once been a slave to pay his ransom to his former master despite being treated cruelly patrick didn't hold a grudge against him as patrick approached his master's old homestead to his horror he saw that it was in flames patrick found out that the stories people told about him had preceded him and in a fit of frenzy his old master gathered all his treasures into his mansion set them on fire and then threw himself into the flames an ancient record adds that his pride could not endure the thought of being vanquished by his former slave there are a lot of legends surrounding saint patrick some say that he raised people from the dead others say that he drove snakes out of ireland but since there aren't any fossil records of snakes in ireland at that time it's highly unlikely unless he drove out the fossils as well many think that snakes was a metaphor for the conversion of the pagans meaning that he drove paganism out from ireland green wasn't the original color associated with st patrick it was first blue it eventually changed for various reasons probably because of being used in various irish flags and how green is associated with ireland itself patrick worked in ireland for 30 years afterwards he retired and then died on march 17th in ad-461 there wasn't a canonization process when patrick died that didn't come up until the 12th century he would have been declared his same by acclamation and his sainthood approved by a local bishop soon after he died st patrick's day was originally a catholic holiday and still is but has also evolved into a secular holiday being celebrated by non-irish non-catholics and ironically enough even atheists today when people think of st patrick they imagine a leprechaun in a green jacket hat pipe clover and a pot of gold not a man who devoted 30 years of his life to teaching and helping the irish hopefully you now know a little more about the history of st patrick you

**Transcript**:
On first glance, this painting might not
seem terribly special, but it's actually one of the most analyzed
paintings in the history of art. It's called "Las Meninas,"
or "The Maids of Honor," painted by Diego Velázquez in 1656, and it depicts a scene in the life
of the Spanish Royal Court. A well-dressed child princess refuses
a glass of water from a handmaid, while a dwarf teases a dog. A second dwarf stands next to them, while the artist himself 
pauses at his canvas. Two more people whisper in the background, while a third appears 
to be exiting the room, and why wouldn't he when there seems
to be so little going on? Even the dog looks bored. But look more closely. The two people reflected
in the blurry mirror at the back, easily missed at first glance, are none other than
King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, seemingly changing the scene from a simple
depiction of court life to that of a royal portrait. And with this piece of information, we can begin to understand far more
about the painting and why it has captivated viewers
for centuries. First, there's the historical context. When "Las Meninas" was painted
at the end of Philip's reign, the Spanish Empire 
was in a period of decline, having suffered defeat in
The Thirty Years War, as well as economic 
and political difficulties. The King himself had also 
suffered misfortune, losing both his first wife and his only 
heir to the throne before remarrying. But the painting obscures their struggle
to provide food for their household. Even the monarch's advanced 
age is concealed through the blurring of the mirror. What we do see in the geometric center
of the canvas, brightly illuminated by the light
from the window, in the Infanta Margarita Teresa, the King's only living legitimate child
at the time. Her glowing and healthy appearance is an idealized view of the struggling
empire's future. However, the Infanta is not the only
center of the painting. Through the clever use of perspective, as well as painting the work life-sized,
on a 10.5 x 9 foot canvas, Velázquez blurs the boundary
between art and reality, creating the sense of a three-dimensional
picture that we can walk into. The line between the ceiling and the wall
converges to the open door, further creating the perception
of the painting as a physical space seen from the viewer's perspective. In this sense, the audience
and the real world are the focus, underlined by the three figures
looking straight at the viewer. But there is still another focal point. The line formed by the light fixtures
leads to the center of the back wall to the mirror reflecting the royal couple. And its positioning relative to the viewer has led to radically different 
interpretations of the entire work. The mirror could be reflecting the King
and Queen posing for their portrait, or is it reflecting the canvas? And what do we make of the fact that Velázquez never painted
the royal portrait implied here? Could the painting actually be
depicting its own creation instead? With the incorporation of the mirror
into his work, Velázquez elevated the art of painting from its perception as a simple craft to an intellectual endeavor. With its three competing center points, "Las Meninas" captures the contrast 
between the ideal, the real, and the reflected worlds, maintaining an unresolved tension
between them to tell a more complex story than any mirror can provide.

**Transcript**:
On first glance, this painting might not
seem terribly special, but it's actually one of the most analyzed
paintings in the history of art. It's called "Las Meninas,"
or "The Maids of Honor," painted by Diego Velázquez in 1656, and it depicts a scene in the life
of the Spanish Royal Court. A well-dressed child princess refuses
a glass of water from a handmaid, while a dwarf teases a dog. A second dwarf stands next to them, while the artist himself 
pauses at his canvas. Two more people whisper in the background, while a third appears 
to be exiting the room, and why wouldn't he when there seems
to be so little going on? Even the dog looks bored. But look more closely. The two people reflected
in the blurry mirror at the back, easily missed at first glance, are none other than
King Philip IV and Queen Mariana, seemingly changing the scene from a simple
depiction of court life to that of a royal portrait. And with this piece of information, we can begin to understand far more
about the painting and why it has captivated viewers
for centuries. First, there's the historical context. When "Las Meninas" was painted
at the end of Philip's reign, the Spanish Empire 
was in a period of decline, having suffered defeat in
The Thirty Years War, as well as economic 
and political difficulties. The King himself had also 
suffered misfortune, losing both his first wife and his only 
heir to the throne before remarrying. But the painting obscures their struggle
to provide food for their household. Even the monarch's advanced 
age is concealed through the blurring of the mirror. What we do see in the geometric center
of the canvas, brightly illuminated by the light
from the window, in the Infanta Margarita Teresa, the King's only living legitimate child
at the time. Her glowing and healthy appearance is an idealized view of the struggling
empire's future. However, the Infanta is not the only
center of the painting. Through the clever use of perspective, as well as painting the work life-sized,
on a 10.5 x 9 foot canvas, Velázquez blurs the boundary
between art and reality, creating the sense of a three-dimensional
picture that we can walk into. The line between the ceiling and the wall
converges to the open door, further creating the perception
of the painting as a physical space seen from the viewer's perspective. In this sense, the audience
and the real world are the focus, underlined by the three figures
looking straight at the viewer. But there is still another focal point. The line formed by the light fixtures
leads to the center of the back wall to the mirror reflecting the royal couple. And its positioning relative to the viewer has led to radically different 
interpretations of the entire work. The mirror could be reflecting the King
and Queen posing for their portrait, or is it reflecting the canvas? And what do we make of the fact that Velázquez never painted
the royal portrait implied here? Could the painting actually be
depicting its own creation instead? With the incorporation of the mirror
into his work, Velázquez elevated the art of painting from its perception as a simple craft to an intellectual endeavor. With its three competing center points, "Las Meninas" captures the contrast 
between the ideal, the real, and the reflected worlds, maintaining an unresolved tension
between them to tell a more complex story than any mirror can provide.

**Transcript**:
Scientific breakthrough, the kind that can potentially save lives, can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover, in the evolved, accumulated body of human anecdote, for example, or in the time-tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation, but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence, isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do, the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years, unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that in July of this year, Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western
Australia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide, and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey, but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process, we were looking, it was about three years ago, and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia, and by chance, in a previous role, I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler, who most Australians
would know is a famous naturalist, had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like, to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be, the answer was quite surprising. He said, "Take a black wetsuit, band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee, and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species." I didn't think about that much at the time, and it wasn't until the next three
fatal shark attacks happened, and it caused me to think, maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically, there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns, warning patterns, to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked, not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer, has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s, and anthropologically, Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here? Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define? We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage, particularly for attack, but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target, and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention
to the biological anecdote because that's time-tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts, the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important, passed down from generation to generation, so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior? I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence, because if science could support this concept, then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that, I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology, and a worldwide search, again, led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us, confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white, or grayscale. So I called up Nathan, a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and
mitigate the risk of shark attack, and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics, the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks, so the great white, tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand, using complex computer modeling, what that eye can see at different depths, distances, light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean. And from there, we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics: what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic, and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear, and to that end, I invited Ray Smith, a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer, and in fact the guy that designed
the original Quiksilver logo, to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that
people might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a "don't eat me" wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea, takes that banding idea, it's highly visible, provides a highly disruptive profile, and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food, and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front, and it's particularly better for the surface, where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit, or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit, and in any given conditions, one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially, leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration, so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew, if you wanted to stand out, you needed to look stripy, and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic, you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be, how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. (Laughter) So we have to bait the rig, because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence, and by baiting the rig, we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless, we started the testing process in January of this year, initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait, wrap it in a neoprene skin, and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark
actually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo, we can capture all the statistics
on how big the shark is, what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves, and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to
preserve the scientific method, we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the, what we call, SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting, but very encouraging, and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig, which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged, or encountered this SAMS rig, which is the Elude SAMS rig, about eight minutes before, and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it, looking for what it could
smell and sense but not see, and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more
confident than the tigers, and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig, so a black neoprene wetsuit, and going straight to the bottom, coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig, this is the banded one, where it's more tactile, it's more investigative, it's more apprehensive, and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. (Applause) So, it's important for us that all 
the testing is done independently, and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark 
Attack Mitigation Systems, we're a biotechnology licensing company, so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end, for the first time, live, worldwide -- (Laughter) — I can show you what biological adaptation, science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam, the surfer, from this side. Where are you, Sam? (Applause) And Eduardo. (Applause) Cheers, mate. Cheers. Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause) So what have we done here? Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention, we've paid attention to the biological evidence, we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence, and we've used science as a tool for translation, translation of something that was already there into something that we can 
use for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all, did the Wright brothers discover manned flight, or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically, replicate it in a way that humans could use? As for the humble wetsuit, who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time, in five years' time or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking, I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Can you imagine a party
where every movement, from the slightest gesture
to walking across the room, and every visual detail, from furniture to hemline length, were governed by a complex system
of rules and procedures? For centuries, such rituals
were commonplace for European nobility. And while they've gone out of fashion, we recognize the components
under a familiar label: ballet. Ballet, from Italian "balletto,"
or little dance, originated in Renaissance Italy
as a combination of social dance and choreographed display
at aristocratic gatherings. In many aspects, it was a way
of controlling people in court with acceptable forms of behavior, such as the manner in which people
stepped, bowed, or took someone's hand. It also involved rules governing
everything from attire to where one could walk or sit
in relation to the King. Over time, the study of ballet became
a central element of court life, and proper grasp of the etiquette could
make or break one's success as a courtier. Many of these court gestures can still
be seen in modern ballet techniques. Ballet was brought to France
in the 16th century by Catherine de' Medici, the Italian wife of King Henry II. As celebrations became more lavish,
so did the dance, with dancing masters teaching
elaborate steps to young nobles and story elements providing
a unifying theme. The focus shifted from participation
to performance, and the form acquired 
more theatrical trappings, such as professionally designed sets and a slightly raised platform or stage
with curtains and wings. But it was in the 17th century court
of Louis XIV that ballet was refined into the art
we know today. Louis himself had been trained
in ballet from childhood. His early role as the sun god
Apollo at age fifteen cemented the central role ballet
would play during his reign. It also earned him the title
of Sun King, with his splendid golden costume
and choreography that promoted the idea of the king
as a divinely ordained ruler. Louis would go on to perform
80 roles in 40 major ballets, either as a majestic lead, or sometimes playing minor 
or comedic parts before emerging in the lead role
as the end. He trained daily in ballet, as well as fencing and riding, and through his example, dancing became an essential skill
for all gentlemen of the era. But Louis XIV's main contribution 
to ballet was not as a performer. His founding of 
the Royal Academy of Dance in 1661 shifted control of ballet
from local guilds to the royal court. As director, he appointed his personal ballet master 
and frequent performance partner Pierre Beauchamp, who codified the five main positions 
of the body still used today. Through is collaborations
with Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Royal Music Academy, and famed playwright Molière, Beauchamp helped establish ballet
as a grand spectacle. And in 1669, a separate ballet academy
was founded. The Paris Opera Ballet survives today
as the oldest ballet company in the world. Ballet moved away from the royal court
to the theater and survived the democratic revolutions
and reforms that followed over the next century. With the advent of the romantic movement, fantasy and folklore themes 
became common motifs. And though the influence of ballet
in France would decline, other countries, such as Russia, would play a major role 
in its further development. Fortunately, today most of us don't
have to learn a complicated set of steps just to socialize at a wedding. Instead, we can go to the theater
to see professionals who spend their lives training rigorously to perform feats that would have been
unimagineable in Louis XIV's day.

a unifying theme. The focus shifted from participation
to performance, and the form acquired 
more theatrical trappings, such as professionally designed sets and a slightly raised platform or stage
with curtains and wings. But it was in the 17th century court
of Louis XIV that ballet was refined into the art
we know today. Louis himself had been trained
in ballet from childhood. His early role as the sun god
Apollo at age fifteen cemented the central role ballet
would play during his reign. It also earned him the title
of Sun King, with his splendid golden costume
and choreography that promoted the idea of the king
as a divinely ordained ruler. Louis would go on to perform
80 roles in 40 major ballets, either as a majestic lead, or sometimes playing minor 
or comedic parts before emerging in the lead role
as the end. He trained daily in ballet, as well as fencing and riding, and through his example, dancing became an essential skill
for all gentlemen of the era. But Louis XIV's main contribution 
to ballet was not as a performer. His founding of 
the Royal Academy of Dance in 1661 shifted control of ballet
from local guilds to the royal court. As director, he appointed his personal ballet master 
and frequent performance partner Pierre Beauchamp, who codified the five main positions 
of the body still used today. Through is collaborations
with Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Royal Music Academy, and famed playwright Molière, Beauchamp helped establish ballet
as a grand spectacle. And in 1669, a separate ballet academy
was founded. The Paris Opera Ballet survives today
as the oldest ballet company in the world. Ballet moved away from the royal court
to the theater and survived the democratic revolutions
and reforms that followed over the next century. With the advent of the romantic movement, fantasy and folklore themes 
became common motifs. And though the influence of ballet
in France would decline, other countries, such as Russia, would play a major role 
in its further development. Fortunately, today most of us don't
have to learn a complicated set of steps just to socialize at a wedding. Instead, we can go to the theater
to see professionals who spend their lives training rigorously to perform feats that would have been
unimagineable in Louis XIV's day.

**Transcript**:
So you're stranded in a huge rainforest,
and you've eaten a poisonous mushroom. To save your life, you need the antidote
excreted by a certain species of frog. Unfortunately, only the female 
of the species produces the antidote, and to make matters worse, the male and female occur in equal
numbers and look identical, with no way for you to tell them apart, except that the male 
has a distinctive croak. And it may just be your lucky day. To your left, you've spotted a frog
on a tree stump, but before you start running to it, you're startled by the croak
of a male frog coming from a clearing 
in the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one 
made the sound. You feel yourself starting 
to lose consciousness, and realize you only have time to go
in one direction before you collapse. What are your chances of survival
if you head for the clearing and lick both of the frogs there? What about if you go to the tree stump? Which way should you go? Press pause now
to calculate odds yourself. 3 2 1 If you chose to go to the clearing,
you're right, but the hard part is correctly 
calculating your odds. There are two common incorrect ways
of solving this problem. Wrong answer number one: Assuming there's a roughly equal
number of males and females, the probability of any one frog being
either sex is one in two, which is 0.5, or 50%. And since all frogs are independent
of each other, the chance of any one of them being female
should still be 50% each time you choose. This logic actually is correct 
for the tree stump, but not for the clearing. Wrong answer two: First, you saw two frogs in the clearing. Now you've learned that at least
one of them is male, but what are the chances that both are? If the probability of each individual frog
being male is 0.5, then multiplying the two together
will give you 0.25, which is one in four, or 25%. So, you have a 75% chance 
of getting at least one female and receiving the antidote. So here's the right answer. Going for the clearing gives you
a two in three chance of survival, or about 67%. If you're wondering how this 
could possibly be right, it's because of something called
conditional probability. Let's see how it unfolds. When we first see the two frogs, there are several possible combinations
of male and female. If we write out the full list, we have what mathematicians call
the sample space, and as we can see, out of the four possible combinations,
only one has two males. So why was the answer of 75% wrong? Because the croak gives 
us additional information. As soon as we know 
that one of the frogs is male, that tells us there can't be 
a pair of females, which means we can eliminate
that possibility from the sample space, leaving us with 
three possible combinations. Of them, one still has two males, giving us our two in three,
or 67% chance of getting a female. This is how conditional probability works. You start off with a large sample space
that includes every possibility. But every additional piece of information
allows you to eliminate possibilities, shrinking the sample space and increasing the probability 
of getting a particular combination. The point is that information
affects probability. And conditional probability isn't just
the stuff of abstract mathematical games. It pops up in the real world, as well. Computers and other devices use
conditional probability to detect likely errors in the strings
of 1's and 0's that all our data consists of. And in many of our own life decisions, we use information gained from 
past experience and our surroundings to narrow down our choices
to the best options so that maybe next time, we can avoid eating that poisonous 
mushroom in the first place.

in the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one 
made the sound. You feel yourself starting 
to lose consciousness, and realize you only have time to go
in one direction before you collapse. What are your chances of survival
if you head for the clearing and lick both of the frogs there? What about if you go to the tree stump? Which way should you go? Press pause now
to calculate odds yourself. 3 2 1 If you chose to go to the clearing,
you're right, but the hard part is correctly 
calculating your odds. There are two common incorrect ways
of solving this problem. Wrong answer number one: Assuming there's a roughly equal
number of males and females, the probability of any one frog being
either sex is one in two, which is 0.5, or 50%. And since all frogs are independent
of each other, the chance of any one of them being female
should still be 50% each time you choose. This logic actually is correct 
for the tree stump, but not for the clearing. Wrong answer two: First, you saw two frogs in the clearing. Now you've learned that at least
one of them is male, but what are the chances that both are? If the probability of each individual frog
being male is 0.5, then multiplying the two together
will give you 0.25, which is one in four, or 25%. So, you have a 75% chance 
of getting at least one female and receiving the antidote. So here's the right answer. Going for the clearing gives you
a two in three chance of survival, or about 67%. If you're wondering how this 
could possibly be right, it's because of something called
conditional probability. Let's see how it unfolds. When we first see the two frogs, there are several possible combinations
of male and female. If we write out the full list, we have what mathematicians call
the sample space, and as we can see, out of the four possible combinations,
only one has two males. So why was the answer of 75% wrong? Because the croak gives 
us additional information. As soon as we know 
that one of the frogs is male, that tells us there can't be 
a pair of females, which means we can eliminate
that possibility from the sample space, leaving us with 
three possible combinations. Of them, one still has two males, giving us our two in three,
or 67% chance of getting a female. This is how conditional probability works. You start off with a large sample space
that includes every possibility. But every additional piece of information
allows you to eliminate possibilities, shrinking the sample space and increasing the probability 
of getting a particular combination. The point is that information
affects probability. And conditional probability isn't just
the stuff of abstract mathematical games. It pops up in the real world, as well. Computers and other devices use
conditional probability to detect likely errors in the strings
of 1's and 0's that all our data consists of. And in many of our own life decisions, we use information gained from 
past experience and our surroundings to narrow down our choices
to the best options so that maybe next time, we can avoid eating that poisonous 
mushroom in the first place.

**Transcript**:
So you're stranded in a huge rainforest,
and you've eaten a poisonous mushroom. To save your life, you need the antidote
excreted by a certain species of frog. Unfortunately, only the female 
of the species produces the antidote, and to make matters worse, the male and female occur in equal
numbers and look identical, with no way for you to tell them apart, except that the male 
has a distinctive croak. And it may just be your lucky day. To your left, you've spotted a frog
on a tree stump, but before you start running to it, you're startled by the croak
of a male frog coming from a clearing 
in the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one
