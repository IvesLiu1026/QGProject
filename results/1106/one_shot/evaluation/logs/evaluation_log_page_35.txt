**Transcript**:
In 1962, a cave explorer 
named Michel Siffre started a series of experiments where
he isolated himself underground for months without light or clocks. He attached himself to electrodes
that monitored his vital signs and kept track of when he slept and ate. When Siffre finally emerged, the results of his pioneering experiments revealed that his body had kept
to a regular sleeping-waking cycle. Despite having no external cues, he fell asleep, woke up, and ate at fixed intervals. This became known as a circadian rhythm
from the Latin for "about a day." Scientists later found these rhythms
affect our hormone secretion, how our bodies process food, and even the effects 
of drugs on our bodies. The field of sciences studying
these changes is called chronobiology. Being able to sense time helps us do
everything from waking and sleeping to knowing precisely when to catch a ball
that's hurtling towards us. We owe all these abilities to 
an interconnected system of timekeepers in our brains. It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch
telling us how many seconds elapsed, a clock counting the hours of the day, and a calendar notifying us 
of the seasons. Each one is located in 
a different brain region. Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied
on the most primitive clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN
of the hypothalamus. Here's the basics of how we think it works
based on fruitfly and mouse studies. Proteins known as CLK, or clock,
accumulate in the SCN throughout the day. In addition to activating genes
that tell us to stay awake, they make another protein called PER. When enough PER accumulates, it deactivates the gene that makes CLK, eventually making us fall asleep. Then, clock falls low, so PER 
concentrations also drop again, allowing CLK to rise, starting the cycle over. There are other proteins involved, but our day and night cycle may be driven
in part by this seesaw effect between CLK by day and PER by night. For more precision, our SCNs also rely 
on external cues like light, food, noise, and temperature. We called these zeitgebers, German for "givers of time." Siffre lacked many 
of these cues underground, but in normal life, they fine tune
our daily behavior. For instance, as natural morning light
filters into our eyes, it helps wake us up. Traveling through the optic nerve
to the SCN, it communicates what's happening
in the outside world. The hypothalamus then halts
the production of melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. At the same time, it increases the production
of vasopressin and noradrenaline throughout the brain, which help control our sleep cycles. At about 10 am, the body's rising temperature drives up
our energy and alertness, and later in the afternoon, it also improves our muscle activity
and coordination. Bright screens at night can confuse
these signals, which is why binging on TV before bed
makes it harder to sleep. But sometimes we need to be
even more precise when telling the time, which is where the brain's internal 
stopwatch chimes in. One theory for how this works 
involves the fact that communication between a given
pair of neurons always takes roughly the same
amount of time. So neurons in our cortex 
and other brain areas may communicate in scheduled,
predictable loops that the cortex uses to judge
with precision how much time has passed. That creates our perception of time. In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating
additional discovery about this. Every day, he challenged himself 
to count up to 120 at the rate of one digit per second. Over time, instead of taking two minutes,
it began taking him as long as five. Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped
Siffre's own perception of time despite his brain's best efforts
to keep him on track. This makes us wonder what else influences
our sense of time. And if time isn't objective, 
what does that mean? Could each of us 
be experiencing it differently? Only time will tell.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the brain's production of certain chemicals to stay awake. The most similar generated MCQ is not directly related to this topic, but some generated MCQs discuss the brain's internal clock and the regulation of sleep-wake cycles.

However, one generated MCQ that might be considered somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 6: What is the role of the protein CLK in the SCN? Options: A. To activate genes that tell us to sleep, B. To deactivate genes that tell us to stay awake, C. To accumulate throughout the day and activate genes that tell us to stay awake, D. To regulate the production of melatonin Correct Option: None

This question is not directly related to the production of vasopressin and noradrenaline to stay awake, but it does discuss the role of a protein in regulating the sleep-wake cycle.

A more relevant generated MCQ might be:

Question 8: What is the effect of bright screens at night on our sleep cycles? Options: A. It helps us fall asleep faster, B. It has no effect on our sleep cycles, C. It makes it harder to sleep, D. It improves the quality of our sleep Correct Option: None

This question is still not directly related to the production of vasopressin and noradrenaline to stay awake, but it does discuss a factor that affects sleep-wake cycles.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, although it is still not very similar.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: Where is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) located in the brain? Options: A. In the cortex, B. In the hypothalamus, C. In the cerebellum, D. In the brainstem.

However, the correct answer in Question 5 is B, but the ground truth MCQ asks about the location of the stopwatch in the brain, not the SCN. 

A more accurate match would be Question 9: What is the theory behind the brain's internal stopwatch? Options: A. That communication between neurons always takes the same amount of time, B. That the brain uses external cues to estimate time, C. That the brain has a built-in clock that measures time, D. That the brain uses past experiences to estimate time.

The correct answer in Question 9 is A, but it does not directly ask about the location of the stopwatch. It asks about the theory behind it.

Since there is no direct match, I will choose Question 5 as the closest match because it at least asks about a location in the brain, but please note that it is not a perfect match.

to a regular sleeping-waking cycle. Despite having no external cues, he fell asleep, woke up, and ate at fixed intervals. This became known as a circadian rhythm
from the Latin for "about a day." Scientists later found these rhythms
affect our hormone secretion, how our bodies process food, and even the effects 
of drugs on our bodies. The field of sciences studying
these changes is called chronobiology. Being able to sense time helps us do
everything from waking and sleeping to knowing precisely when to catch a ball
that's hurtling towards us. We owe all these abilities to 
an interconnected system of timekeepers in our brains. It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch
telling us how many seconds elapsed, a clock counting the hours of the day, and a calendar notifying us 
of the seasons. Each one is located in 
a different brain region. Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied
on the most primitive clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN
of the hypothalamus. Here's the basics of how we think it works
based on fruitfly and mouse studies. Proteins known as CLK, or clock,
accumulate in the SCN throughout the day. In addition to activating genes
that tell us to stay awake, they make another protein called PER. When enough PER accumulates, it deactivates the gene that makes CLK, eventually making us fall asleep. Then, clock falls low, so PER 
concentrations also drop again, allowing CLK to rise, starting the cycle over. There are other proteins involved, but our day and night cycle may be driven
in part by this seesaw effect between CLK by day and PER by night. For more precision, our SCNs also rely 
on external cues like light, food, noise, and temperature. We called these zeitgebers, German for "givers of time." Siffre lacked many 
of these cues underground, but in normal life, they fine tune
our daily behavior. For instance, as natural morning light
filters into our eyes, it helps wake us up. Traveling through the optic nerve
to the SCN, it communicates what's happening
in the outside world. The hypothalamus then halts
the production of melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. At the same time, it increases the production
of vasopressin and noradrenaline throughout the brain, which help control our sleep cycles. At about 10 am, the body's rising temperature drives up
our energy and alertness, and later in the afternoon, it also improves our muscle activity
and coordination. Bright screens at night can confuse
these signals, which is why binging on TV before bed
makes it harder to sleep. But sometimes we need to be
even more precise when telling the time, which is where the brain's internal 
stopwatch chimes in. One theory for how this works 
involves the fact that communication between a given
pair of neurons always takes roughly the same
amount of time. So neurons in our cortex 
and other brain areas may communicate in scheduled,
predictable loops that the cortex uses to judge
with precision how much time has passed. That creates our perception of time. In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating
additional discovery about this. Every day, he challenged himself 
to count up to 120 at the rate of one digit per second. Over time, instead of taking two minutes,
it began taking him as long as five. Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped
Siffre's own perception of time despite his brain's best efforts
to keep him on track. This makes us wonder what else influences
our sense of time. And if time isn't objective, 
what does that mean? Could each of us 
be experiencing it differently? Only time will tell.

**Transcript**:
In 2011, a team of physicists reported
a startling discovery: neutrinos traveled faster 
than the speed of light by 60 billionths of a second in their 730 kilometer trip from Geneva
to a detector in Italy. Despite six months of double checking,
the bizarre discovery refused to yield. But rather than celebrating 
a physics revolution, the researchers published a cautious paper arguing for continued research in an
effort to explain the observed anomaly. In time, the error was tracked to a single
incorrectly connected fiber optic cable. This example reminds us that real
science is more than static textbooks. Instead, researchers around the world
are continuously publishing their latest discoveries with each paper adding 
to the scientific conversation. Published studies 
can motivate future research, inspire new products, and inform government policy. So it's important that we have confidence
in the published results. If their conclusions are wrong, we risk time, resources, and even our health in the pursuit
of false leads. When findings are significant, they are frequently double-checked
by other researchers, either by reanalyzing the data or by redoing the entire experiment. For example, it took repeated 
investigation of the CERN data before the timing error was tracked down. Unfortunately, there are currently neither
the resources nor professional incentives to double check the more than 1 million
scientific papers published annually. Even when papers are challenged,
the results are not reassuring. Recent studies that examined dozens
of published pharmaceutical papers managed to replicate the results of
less than 25% of them. And similar results have been found
in other scientific disciplines. There are a variety of sources 
for irreproducible results. Errors could hide in their original
design, execution, or analysis of the data. Unknown factors, such as patients' undisclosed condition
in a medical study, can produce results that are 
not repeatable in new test subjects. And sometimes, the second research group
can't reproduce the original results simply because they don't know
exactly what the original group did. However, some problems might stem
from systematic decisions in how we do science. Researchers, the institutions that employ them, and the scientific journals 
that publish findings are expected to produce 
big results frequently. Important papers can advance careers, generate media interest, and secure essential funding, so there's slim motivation for researchers
to challenge their own exciting results. In addition, little incentive exists to publish results unsupportive
of the expected hypothesis. That results in a deluge of agreement
between what was expected and what was found. In rare occasions, this can even lead
to deliberate fabrication, such as in 2013, when a researcher
spiked rabbit blood with human blood to give false evidence that 
his HIV vaccine was working. The publish or perish mindset can also compromise academic journals'
traditional peer-review processes which are safety checks where experts examine submitted papers
for potential shortcomings. The current system, which might involve only one
or two reviewers, can be woefully ineffective. That was demonstrated in a 1998 study where eight weaknesses were deliberately
inserted into papers, but only around 25% 
were caught upon review. Many scientists are working toward
improving reproducibility in their fields. There's a push to make researchers
raw data, experimental procedures, and analytical techniques 
more openly available in order to ease replication efforts. The peer review process can also
be strengthened to more efficiently weed out weak papers
prior to publication. And we could temper the pressure
to find big results by publishing more papers that fail
to confirm the original hypothesis, an event that happens far more than
current scientific literature suggests. Science always has, and always will,
encounter some false starts as part of the collective acquisition
of new knowledge. Finding ways to improve 
the reproducibility of our results can help us weed out those false starts
more effectively, keeping us moving steadily toward
exciting new discoveries.

**Transcript**:
In 2011, a team of physicists reported
a startling discovery: neutrinos traveled faster 
than the speed of light by 60 billionths of a second in their 730 kilometer trip from Geneva
to a detector in Italy. Despite six months of double checking,
the bizarre discovery refused to yield. But rather than celebrating 
a physics revolution, the researchers published a cautious paper arguing for continued research in an
effort to explain the observed anomaly. In time, the error was tracked to a single
incorrectly connected fiber optic cable. This example reminds us that real
science is more than static textbooks. Instead, researchers around the world
are continuously publishing their latest discoveries with each paper adding 
to the scientific conversation. Published studies 
can motivate future research, inspire new products, and inform government policy. So it's important that we have confidence
in the published results. If their conclusions are wrong, we risk time, resources, and even our health in the pursuit
of false leads. When findings are significant, they are frequently double-checked
by other researchers, either by reanalyzing the data or by redoing the entire experiment. For example, it took repeated 
investigation of the CERN data before the timing error was tracked down. Unfortunately, there are currently neither
the resources nor professional incentives to double check the more than 1 million
scientific papers published annually. Even when papers are challenged,
the results are not reassuring. Recent studies that examined dozens
of published pharmaceutical papers managed to replicate the results of
less than 25% of them. And similar results have been found
in other scientific disciplines. There are a variety of sources 
for irreproducible results. Errors could hide in their original
design, execution, or analysis of the data. Unknown factors, such as patients' undisclosed condition
in a medical study, can produce results that are 
not repeatable in new test subjects. And sometimes, the second research group
can't reproduce the original results simply because they don't know
exactly what the original group did. However, some problems might stem
from systematic decisions in how we do science. Researchers, the institutions that employ them, and the scientific journals 
that publish findings are expected to produce 
big results frequently. Important papers can advance careers, generate media interest, and secure essential funding, so there's slim motivation for researchers
to challenge their own exciting results. In addition, little incentive exists to publish results unsupportive
of the expected hypothesis. That results in a deluge of agreement
between what was expected and what was found. In rare occasions, this can even lead
to deliberate fabrication, such as in 2013, when a researcher
spiked rabbit blood with human blood to give false evidence that 
his HIV vaccine was working. The publish or perish mindset can also compromise academic journals'
traditional peer-review processes which are safety checks where experts examine submitted papers
for potential shortcomings. The current system, which might involve only one
or two reviewers, can be woefully ineffective. That was demonstrated in a 1998 study where eight weaknesses were deliberately
inserted into papers, but only around 25% 
were caught upon review. Many scientists are working toward
improving reproducibility in their fields. There's a push to make researchers
raw data, experimental procedures, and analytical techniques 
more openly available in order to ease replication efforts. The peer review process can also
be strengthened to more efficiently weed out weak papers
prior to publication. And we could temper the pressure
to find big results by publishing more papers that fail
to confirm the original hypothesis, an event that happens far more than
current scientific literature suggests. Science always has, and always will,
encounter some false starts as part of the collective acquisition
of new knowledge. Finding ways to improve 
the reproducibility of our results can help us weed out those false starts
more effectively, keeping us moving steadily toward
exciting new discoveries.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9: How can the peer-review process be strengthened?

Although the question is not an exact match, the options provided in Question 9 align with the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to identify potential remedies for irreproducibility. Option C in the ground truth MCQ, "Require all scientists to pay journals before their results can be published," is not a viable solution and is intended to be the incorrect answer. Similarly, Question 9 provides options that are potential solutions to improve the peer-review process, which is related to addressing irreproducibility.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would select Question 9.

**Transcript**:
Professor Fukanō, the famous 
eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop
in a plane of his own design. Able to travel consistently at the
incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours
to circle the world. There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters
of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey. Let's be honest. The professor probably could have
designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that? Instead, he's devised a slightly more
elaborate solution: building three identical planes
for the mission. In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them
with a few other incredible features. Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount
of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other. The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri
and Orokana will pilot each of the others. However, only one airport,
located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where 
the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground. How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously
for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out 
of fuel and crashing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off
by a hair. The key is to maximize the support
each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel. It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips
in either direction while setting the professor up for a long
unsupported stretch in the middle. Here's his solution. All three planes take off at noon
flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. After 45 minutes, or one-eighth
of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left. Orokana gives 45 to the professor
and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both. With her remaining 45, 
Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge
for a well-deserved break. 45 minutes later, with one-quarter
of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri
are both at 135 kiloliters again. Fugōri transfers 45 
into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90
he needs to return. Professor Fukanō stretches
and puts on his favorite album. He'll be alone for a while. In the meantime, Orokana has been
anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go. As soon as his plane touches the ground,
she takes off, this time flying east. At this point, exactly 180 minutes 
have passed and the professor is at the halfway point
of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left. For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes 
fly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark. Just as the professor's fuel 
is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane. She gives him 45 kiloliters 
of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each. But that's just half of what they need
to make it to the airport. Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,
having refueled, takes off. 45 minutes later, just as the other two
planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel
to each, leaving 45 for himself. All three planes land at the airport
just as their fuel gauges reach zero. As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will
soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how 
to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of degrees of longitude the entire Earth is divided into. None of the generated MCQs ask this exact question. However, Question 1 mentions "one degree longitude around the equator per minute" and asks about the time it would take to circle the world.

Although it's not a direct match, Question 1 is the closest in terms of mentioning degrees of longitude. However, it's essential to note that the question intent and content are still quite different.

If I had to choose, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but it's still not a good match.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the total fuel contained within all three airplanes at the beginning of the trip. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 7 asks about the amount of fuel each plane has left after 45 minutes of flying, which is related to the fuel capacity of the planes.

However, a more relevant question would be one that asks about the fuel capacity of the planes. Question 2 mentions the fuel capacity of Professor Fukanō's plane (180 kiloliters), but it does not ask about the total fuel capacity of all three planes.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 2, but with the caveat that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Professor Fukanō, the famous 
eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop
in a plane of his own design. Able to travel consistently at the
incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours
to circle the world. There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters
of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey. Let's be honest. The professor probably could have
designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that? Instead, he's devised a slightly more
elaborate solution: building three identical planes
for the mission. In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them
with a few other incredible features. Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount
of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other. The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri
and Orokana will pilot each of the others. However, only one airport,
located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where 
the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground. How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously
for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out 
of fuel and crashing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off
by a hair. The key is to maximize the support
each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel. It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips
in either direction while setting the professor up for a long
unsupported stretch in the middle. Here's his solution. All three planes take off at noon
flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. After 45 minutes, or one-eighth
of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left. Orokana gives 45 to the professor
and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both. With her remaining 45, 
Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge
for a well-deserved break. 45 minutes later, with one-quarter
of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri
are both at 135 kiloliters again. Fugōri transfers 45 
into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90
he needs to return. Professor Fukanō stretches
and puts on his favorite album. He'll be alone for a while. In the meantime, Orokana has been
anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go. As soon as his plane touches the ground,
she takes off, this time flying east. At this point, exactly 180 minutes 
have passed and the professor is at the halfway point
of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left. For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes 
fly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark. Just as the professor's fuel 
is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane. She gives him 45 kiloliters 
of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each. But that's just half of what they need
to make it to the airport. Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,
having refueled, takes off. 45 minutes later, just as the other two
planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel
to each, leaving 45 for himself. All three planes land at the airport
just as their fuel gauges reach zero. As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will
soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how 
to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, Question 2 is the closest match because it discusses a problem related to the mission, which is the limited fuel capacity of the plane.

Although Question 2 does not directly ask about the key to completing the mission, it touches on the main challenge that the key is intended to address. The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ, "Maximizing the support each assistance provides," is a strategy to overcome the problem mentioned in Question 2.

While none of the generated MCQs ask about the distance, Question 1 is related to the professor's journey and asks about the time it would take to circle the world. However, it's not similar enough to be considered a match.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to the ground truth MCQ. However, if you'd like me to pick one, I would say Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the list. However, Question 3: "Why are owl pellets important for paleontologists?" has an option B that mentions "They provide a record of the types of rodents that lived in a region." which contains a description of owl pellets as "congealed bird vomit" in the transcript, but it is not an exact match.

A more suitable match can be found if we consider the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ. Since the ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of an owl pellet, we can look for a generated MCQ that provides a definition or a description of an owl pellet.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the definition of an owl pellet. However, based on the content of the transcript and the options provided, I would suggest that Question 3 is the closest match, but it is still not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 3 (Index: 3), but with the caveat that it is not an exact match.

However, I can suggest a new generated MCQ that would be a better match:

Question: What is an owl pellet?
Options: A. the carcass that is left over after an owl eats its prey, B. owl excrement, C. congealed bird vomit, D. none of the above

This new generated MCQ directly asks for the definition of an owl pellet and provides the same options as the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the list. However, Question 3: "Why are owl pellets important for paleontologists?" has an option B that mentions "They provide a record of the types of rodents that lived in a region." which contains a description of owl pellets as "congealed bird vomit" in the transcript, but it is not an exact match.

A more suitable match can be found if we consider the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ. Since the ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of an owl pellet, we can look for a generated MCQ that provides a definition or a description of an owl pellet.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask for the definition of an owl pellet. However, based on the content of the transcript and the options provided, I would suggest that Question 3 is the closest match, but it is still not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 3 (Index: 3), but with the caveat that it is not an exact match.

However, I can suggest a new generated MCQ that would be a better match:

Question: What is an owl pellet?
Options: A. the carcass that is left over after an owl eats its prey, B. owl excrement, C. congealed bird vomit, D. none of the above

This new generated MCQ directly asks for the definition of an owl pellet and provides the same options as the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

**Transcript**:
With every year, machines surpass humans
in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of. Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out 
what we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines 
and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us
or manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion
be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains
interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman
identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood
the same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile
signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly
getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms,
such as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that
mimic our biological neurons by forming connections 
and exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs
pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify
those samples by adjusting the relative weights
assigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes
at correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences
to shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just
limited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion,
and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence
structure in our writing. You might think that training
neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much 
data is out there, and how quickly modern computers
can process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor
physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect
enough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses
for computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify
facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people
with a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering
using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts
that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help
treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost
automated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network
automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs
is also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy
when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit
our emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify
the people likely to commit crimes before they even make 
a conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances,
like irony, and scales of emotions,
just how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able
to accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear
of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is about the requirement for training neural networks successfully. The closest match among the generated MCQs is Question 3, which talks about how machines interpret emotions through machine learning algorithms. However, it does not explicitly mention the requirement for training neural networks.

A more suitable match would be a question that explicitly mentions the training of neural networks. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
With every year, machines surpass humans
in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of. Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out 
what we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines 
and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us
or manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion
be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains
interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman
identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood
the same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile
signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly
getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms,
such as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that
mimic our biological neurons by forming connections 
and exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs
pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify
those samples by adjusting the relative weights
assigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes
at correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences
to shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just
limited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion,
and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence
structure in our writing. You might think that training
neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much 
data is out there, and how quickly modern computers
can process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor
physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect
enough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses
for computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify
facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people
with a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering
using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts
that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help
treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost
automated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network
automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs
is also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy
when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit
our emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify
the people likely to commit crimes before they even make 
a conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances,
like irony, and scales of emotions,
just how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able
to accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear
of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is about a major problem for self-driving cars, which is not mentioned in the transcript or any of the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of decision-making and unknown situations, I would choose:

**Generated MCQ 3: How do machines interpret emotions, according to the transcript?**

is not the best match, but 

**Generated MCQ 9: What is one of the concerns about the use of computerized emotion recognition mentioned in the transcript?**

has an option that mentions the potential for authorities to identify people likely to commit crimes before they act, which involves decision-making in unknown situations.

But since the options and the question intent are not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, I must conclude that there is no good match.

If I really had to choose an index, I would say: **9** (but with the caveat that it's not a good match).

**Transcript**:
HANNAH FRY: So today we're going to talk about rock-paper-scissors and I reckon everyone knows how to play it Scissors beats paper, paper covers rock, rock blunts scissors, so three-- BRADY: Wait, I always thought it smashed them?
Dr. FRY: Oh, I thought it blunts them Actually, if anything, it would probably sharpen them, right? There are three strategies, each one of them loses once and wins once So it looks like there's no strategy that you can play to win, but I'm going to show you about a new paper that had just come out where it gives you some top tips of how to win So it's a group of Chinese scientists, where they run an experiment where they got 360 students to play games of rock-paper-scissors with one another 300 rounds in every game, which took up to 2 hours, which is astonishing, students playing 
rock-paper-scissors for 2 hours Okay, so normally if you have rock-paper-scissors and some of you had rock (R) up there, and rock is beaten by paper (P), which is then beaten by scissors (S) So none of these strategies dominate the other, so really all you can do is play each strategy with an equal probability: 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, okay Now, if you were playing against a computer, who was choosing these perfectly randomly, then that would be the best thing for you to do -- just to pick each strategy with equal probability But the thing is, humans are quite predictably irrational, so to say, in the way they choose their strategy So, in recording what one of these students did in playing rock-paper-scissors the scientists came up with two quite important findings of how people try to beat each other Okay, so the first one is that people who win tend to repeat their strategy So, for example, if I beat you by playing rock, there is a very high chance, or high probability that I will play rock again the second time. If it worked once, it's going to work again, right? The second thing that they found out is that losers change BRADY: To anything in particular, or...?
DR. FRY: Well, so this is a thing that you can exploit, essentially so if you know-- so this gives us, I suppose, two strategies that we can use So the first tip is that if you lose, that means the other person just won, right? So let's imagine that your opponent won by playing rock Now, the chances are that they're going to play rock again, you should then play paper so you just lost on scissors, so you should play paper which means that, basically, even though paper beats rock (so the cycle goes around like this: paper beats rock and so on) you should go the other way around the triangle Let's imagine that you played scissors, the other person played rock, what you should do is you should go backwards around this triangle and play paper the next time because of the high chance that they're going to play rock again So that's the first thing: Go backwards, I guess Or another way to say it is -- essentially, you've just played scissors, they've played rock so play the thing that didn't come up in that, if you lose Now the second thing, is that if you've just won now, they're going to expect you to play the same thing again, right? which means, that they're going to play the thing that you would beat the thing that you just played so you need to play the thing that would beat that would beat the thing that you just played which is equivalent to saying, you need to play what they just played you want to [laughs] let's go again [both laugh] BRADY: I like the easy way better, so you should play what they just played DR. FRY: You should play what they just played, yes So let's imagine, then, you just won -- you played rock, right? -- and you just won on rock that means that they played scissors, now they're going to think that you're going to play rock again, which means that they're going to play paper, which means that you should play scissors and so again, you basically end up going backwards around the triangle so play what they just played, and the game go backwards or an easier way to say it then is to play what they just played. So in general, if you're cycling through rock-paper-scissors, your best strategy is to go backwards and go scissors-paper-rock, and cycle through that way BRADY: How much-- Is this mathematics or is this psychology? This is-- I can't tell if this is all to do with probability, or it's just about knowing how humans think DR. FRY: Well, I think that a balance of the two, so it's rooted in game theory which is the mathematics of looking at decisions and strategies, so in any situation where you're competing against someone, and you best move is dependent on what the other person is playing, you can frame in game theory BRADY: Numberphile is brought to you by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute But this video has also been sponsored by Squarespace Squarespace is a great service for designing, hosting, creating your own websites and as probably mentioned before, I use it myself No matter what you want to do -- a blog, podcast, shop, portfolio, Squarespace is as easy as 1-2-3 But it's not just amateurs who benefit from Squarespace and all its brilliant templates, Their developer platform will also give you full control over all the code, letting you tweak the HTML, CSS and Javascript into your heart's content And if you like stats, and you're watching Numberphile, you'll really like watching Squarespace's analytics, their 3rd party integrations, and their easy-to-use commerce If you'd like to find out more, go to squarespace.com/numberphile you can try it all out, you can set up your own site, and you can do it all for free, no credit card required And then if you do like it, and decide to opt in, use the offer code NUMBERPHILE and you get 10% off So thank you very much to Squarespace for supporting this video and thank you to you for watching it

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What is a strategy for winning at rock-paper-scissors against a human opponent, based on the study mentioned in the video?**

Although the question wording is not identical, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the specific strategy to play after winning with rock, while the generated MCQ asks about the general strategy for winning against a human opponent. However, the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (playing scissors after winning with rock) is related to the strategy mentioned in the generated MCQ (playing the move that the opponent played previously, or going backward around the rock-paper-scissors triangle).

To make the generated MCQ more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the question could be rephrased to focus on the specific scenario of winning with rock and asking what to play next.

**Transcript**:
You work at the college library. You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280
different books arrives. The books have been dropped of
in one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting 
system is broken. To make matters worse,
classes start tomorrow, which means that 
first thing in the morning, students will show up in droves
looking for these books. How can you get them all sorted in time? One way would be to start at one end
of the line with the first pair of books. If the first two books are in order,
then leave them as they are. Otherwise, swap them. Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach 
the end of the line. At some point, you'll come across
the book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every
subsequent book, moving it down the line until it
reaches the end where it belongs. Then, start from the beginning
and repeat the process to get the second to last book
in its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted. This approach is called Bubble Sort. It's simple but slow. You'd make 1,279 comparisons
in the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons. If each took just one second,
the process would take over nine days. A second strategy would be to start
by sorting just the first two books. Then, take the third book and compare it
with the book in the second spot. If it belongs before the second book,
swap them, then compare it 
with the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed. Now you've sorted the first three books. Keep adding one book at a time
to the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book
with the one before it until it's correctly placed
among the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't
require comparing every pair of books. On average, we'd expect to only need
to compare each book to half of the books that came before it. In that case, the total 
number of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days. You're still doing 
way too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it
to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books 
that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it
on its right. You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare 
any of the books on the left to any of the ones 
on the right ever again. Now, looking only 
at the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come
before it from those that come after it. You can keep creating 
sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using
another strategy, like Insertion Sort. Each round of partitioning requires
about 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten
would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds. Sorting these sub-lines would add
about 22 seconds each. All in all, this method 
known as QuickSort could sort the books 
in under three and a half hours. But there's a catch. Your partitions could end up lopsided,
saving no time at all. Luckily, this rarely happens. That's why QuickSort is one of the most
efficient strategies used by programmers today. They use it for things like sorting items
in an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations
close to a given location sorted by distance. In your case, you're done quick sorting
with time to spare. Just another high-stakes day 
in the library.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: Why is QuickSort considered an efficient sorting strategy?**

Although the question wording is not identical, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The correct option for the ground truth MCQ (B) explains why QuickSort is faster than Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort, which is related to why QuickSort is considered an efficient sorting strategy.

However, I must note that the options for Question 9 do not exactly match the options for the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ with options that directly compare QuickSort to Insertion Sort and Bubble Sort.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with some caveats.

among the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't
require comparing every pair of books. On average, we'd expect to only need
to compare each book to half of the books that came before it. In that case, the total 
number of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days. You're still doing 
way too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it
to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books 
that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it
on its right. You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare 
any of the books on the left to any of the ones 
on the right ever again. Now, looking only 
at the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come
before it from those that come after it. You can keep creating 
sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using
another strategy, like Insertion Sort. Each round of partitioning requires
about 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten
would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds. Sorting these sub-lines would add
about 22 seconds each. All in all, this method 
known as QuickSort could sort the books 
in under three and a half hours. But there's a catch. Your partitions could end up lopsided,
saving no time at all. Luckily, this rarely happens. That's why QuickSort is one of the most
efficient strategies used by programmers today. They use it for things like sorting items
in an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations
close to a given location sorted by distance. In your case, you're done quick sorting
with time to spare. Just another high-stakes day

**Transcript**:
You work at the college library. You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280
different books arrives. The books have been dropped of
in one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting 
system is broken. To make matters worse,
classes start tomorrow, which means that 
first thing in the morning, students will show up in droves
looking for these books. How can you get them all sorted in time? One way would be to start at one end
of the line with the first pair of books. If the first two books are in order,
then leave them as they are. Otherwise, swap them. Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach 
the end of the line. At some point, you'll come across
the book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every
subsequent book, moving it down the line until it
reaches the end where it belongs. Then, start from the beginning
and repeat the process to get the second to last book
in its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted. This approach is called Bubble Sort. It's simple but slow. You'd make 1,279 comparisons
in the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons. If each took just one second,
the process would take over nine days. A second strategy would be to start
by sorting just the first two books. Then, take the third book and compare it
with the book in the second spot. If it belongs before the second book,
swap them, then compare it 
with the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed. Now you've sorted the first three books. Keep adding one book at a time
to the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book
with the one before it until it's correctly placed
among the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't

**Transcript**:
A boy named Prince Tamino
runs through a dark wood pursued by a dragon. Just as it rears up to devour him, three mysterious ladies appear and slay the dragon 
with their fierce battle cry. So begins Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
"Die Zauberflöte," or "The Magic Flute." This fantasy singspiel, a type of folk opera with music
and dialogue, premiered in 1791 in Vienna. Though it may seem 
like a childish fairytale, this intricate opera is full of
subversive symbolism, and it's now regarded as one of the most
influential operas in history. Tamino's run in with the dragon
is only the start of his journey. The three women summon their leader,
the Queen of the Night. She, in turn, sends Tamino on a quest
to rescue her daughter Pamina from the evil sorcerer, Sarastro. And to help him on his journey,
she gives him the titular magic flute. Tamino eventually finds Pamina
at Sarastro's temple, but behind enemy lines, Tamino and Pamina learn 
that they're on the wrong side. The Queen of Night actually wants
to plunge the world into darkness. Everything Tamino thought he knew
was wrong, filling him with doubt and confusion. So, a new quest begins for Tamino
and Pamina. They must pass three trials of wisdom, and only then can the day 
vanquish the night. Helped by the flute's magic power, the two youths overcome these trials
and the Queen's attempts to sabotage them. They're finally initiated into the temple
having restored balance to the kingdom. Many elements in this peculiar fairytale were inspired by Mozart's involvement 
in Freemasonry, a network of fraternal organizations
throughout Europe. Much of their history, symbolism,
and ritual came from the Middle Ages. But the Freemasons of Mozart's time were also influenced 
by 18th century European ideals - rationalism, humanism, and skepticism
towards traditional authorities, like monarchy and the church. The symbols of Freemasonry 
and these ideals of the Enlightenment are found throughout the opera. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,
that's because it sort of was at the time, but it's now taken quite seriously and has been the subject of considerable
scholarly publication. For example, some Mozart scholars
believe the Queen of the Night symbolizes Maria Theresa,
the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire who opposed Freemasonry
and banned it in Austria. While there continues to be debate
as to the specific meaning, interpretation, and location of these masonic references, scholars agree that they're there
and are fully intentional. One of these symbols is the number three, which represented balance and order
to Freemasons. Now the number three is, of course,
easy to find in any work of storytelling, but it's particularly prominent
in "The Magic Flute": three trials, three ladies, three spirits, and three doors, much of the music 
is written in E-flat major, which has three flats 
in its key signature, and historically, masonic rituals
began with three knocks. The opera references them by opening
with three majestic chords complete with dramatic pauses. Those chords, which reoccur 
throughout the opera, serve another purpose. They capture the dramatic 
arc of the opera in miniature. The first chord, E-flat major,
is in its most natural root position, simple and unadorned. It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino, who, in his naiveté, accepts everything
the Queen and her ladies say without question. The second chord is C minor, a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's 
sadness and doubt in the middle of the opera. That's when his world and notions of
good and evil get turned on their heads. And good and evil are just two of the
opera's extreme opposites. It features some of the highest
and lowest notes in opera, day and night, simple hummable melodies
and complicated forward-looking music. The opera's central theme concerns
balancing these extremes to achieve perfect harmony. To reflect this, the final chord in the opening
restores musical order. It returns to the triumphant E-flat major, the same chord it started with
but inverted, meaning Mozart moved the bottom note
to the top. Although it retains its original harmony,
the chord sounds higher, pointing towards enlightenment. That's similar to Tamino, who in passing his trials restores balance
to the kingdom while growing stronger, wiser,
and more complete.

vanquish the night. Helped by the flute's magic power, the two youths overcome these trials
and the Queen's attempts to sabotage them. They're finally initiated into the temple
having restored balance to the kingdom. Many elements in this peculiar fairytale were inspired by Mozart's involvement 
in Freemasonry, a network of fraternal organizations
throughout Europe. Much of their history, symbolism,
and ritual came from the Middle Ages. But the Freemasons of Mozart's time were also influenced 
by 18th century European ideals - rationalism, humanism, and skepticism
towards traditional authorities, like monarchy and the church. The symbols of Freemasonry 
and these ideals of the Enlightenment are found throughout the opera. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,
that's because it sort of was at the time, but it's now taken quite seriously and has been the subject of considerable
scholarly publication. For example, some Mozart scholars
believe the Queen of the Night symbolizes Maria Theresa,
the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire who opposed Freemasonry
and banned it in Austria. While there continues to be debate
as to the specific meaning, interpretation, and location of these masonic references, scholars agree that they're there
and are fully intentional. One of these symbols is the number three, which represented balance and order
to Freemasons. Now the number three is, of course,
easy to find in any work of storytelling, but it's particularly prominent
in "The Magic Flute": three trials, three ladies, three spirits, and three doors, much of the music 
is written in E-flat major, which has three flats 
in its key signature, and historically, masonic rituals
began with three knocks. The opera references them by opening
with three majestic chords complete with dramatic pauses. Those chords, which reoccur 
throughout the opera, serve another purpose. They capture the dramatic 
arc of the opera in miniature. The first chord, E-flat major,
is in its most natural root position, simple and unadorned. It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino, who, in his naiveté, accepts everything
the Queen and her ladies say without question. The second chord is C minor, a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's 
sadness and doubt in the middle of the opera. That's when his world and notions of
good and evil get turned on their heads. And good and evil are just two of the
opera's extreme opposites. It features some of the highest
and lowest notes in opera, day and night, simple hummable melodies
and complicated forward-looking music. The opera's central theme concerns
balancing these extremes to achieve perfect harmony. To reflect this, the final chord in the opening
restores musical order. It returns to the triumphant E-flat major, the same chord it started with
but inverted, meaning Mozart moved the bottom note
to the top. Although it retains its original harmony,
the chord sounds higher, pointing towards enlightenment. That's similar to Tamino, who in passing his trials restores balance
to the kingdom while growing stronger, wiser,
and more complete.

A boy named Prince Tamino
runs through a dark wood pursued by a dragon. Just as it rears up to devour him, three mysterious ladies appear and slay the dragon 
with their fierce battle cry. So begins Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
"Die Zauberflöte," or "The Magic Flute." This fantasy singspiel, a type of folk opera with music
and dialogue, premiered in 1791 in Vienna. Though it may seem 
like a childish fairytale, this intricate opera is full of
subversive symbolism, and it's now regarded as one of the most
influential operas in history. Tamino's run in with the dragon
is only the start of his journey. The three women summon their leader,
the Queen of the Night. She, in turn, sends Tamino on a quest
to rescue her daughter Pamina from the evil sorcerer, Sarastro. And to help him on his journey,
she gives him the titular magic flute. Tamino eventually finds Pamina
at Sarastro's temple, but behind enemy lines, Tamino and Pamina learn 
that they're on the wrong side. The Queen of Night actually wants
to plunge the world into darkness. Everything Tamino thought he knew
was wrong, filling him with doubt and confusion. So, a new quest begins for Tamino

at Sarastro's temple, but behind enemy lines, Tamino and Pamina learn 
that they're on the wrong side. The Queen of Night actually wants
to plunge the world into darkness. Everything Tamino thought he knew
was wrong, filling him with doubt and confusion. So, a new quest begins for Tamino
and Pamina. They must pass three trials of wisdom, and only then can the day 
vanquish the night. Helped by the flute's magic power, the two youths overcome these trials
and the Queen's attempts to sabotage them. They're finally initiated into the temple
having restored balance to the kingdom. Many elements in this peculiar fairytale were inspired by Mozart's involvement 
in Freemasonry, a network of fraternal organizations
throughout Europe. Much of their history, symbolism,
and ritual came from the Middle Ages. But the Freemasons of Mozart's time were also influenced 
by 18th century European ideals - rationalism, humanism, and skepticism
towards traditional authorities, like monarchy and the church. The symbols of Freemasonry 
and these ideals of the Enlightenment are found throughout the opera. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,
that's because it sort of was at the time, but it's now taken quite seriously and has been the subject of considerable
scholarly publication. For example, some Mozart scholars
believe the Queen of the Night symbolizes Maria Theresa,
the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire who opposed Freemasonry
and banned it in Austria. While there continues to be debate
as to the specific meaning, interpretation, and location of these masonic references, scholars agree that they're there
and are fully intentional. One of these symbols is the number three, which represented balance and order
to Freemasons. Now the number three is, of course,
easy to find in any work of storytelling, but it's particularly prominent
in "The Magic Flute": three trials, three ladies, three spirits, and three doors, much of the music 
is written in E-flat major, which has three flats 
in its key signature, and historically, masonic rituals
began with three knocks. The opera references them by opening
with three majestic chords complete with dramatic pauses. Those chords, which reoccur 
throughout the opera, serve another purpose. They capture the dramatic 
arc of the opera in miniature. The first chord, E-flat major,
is in its most natural root position, simple and unadorned. It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino, who, in his naiveté, accepts everything
the Queen and her ladies say without question. The second chord is C minor, a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's 
sadness and doubt in the middle of the opera. That's when his world and notions of
good and evil get turned on their heads. And good and evil are just two of the
opera's extreme opposites. It features some of the highest
and lowest notes in opera, day and night, simple hummable melodies
and complicated forward-looking music. The opera's central theme concerns
balancing these extremes to achieve perfect harmony. To reflect this, the final chord in the opening
restores musical order. It returns to the triumphant E-flat major, the same chord it started with
but inverted, meaning Mozart moved the bottom note
to the top. Although it retains its original harmony,
the chord sounds higher, pointing towards enlightenment. That's similar to Tamino, who in passing his trials restores balance
to the kingdom while growing stronger, wiser,
and more complete.

**Transcript**:
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694 His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital, and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student. The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer, or rather to remake his name, as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire. The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason, or the Age of Enlightenment, but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire. So, changing his name was a good call. The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well. Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet. At the age of only 24, he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française. By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart, For under the guise of writing a national epic, he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance. Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly. He was not an atheist. In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity was useful for social cohesion. Voltaire's God had created the world, instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat. This was known as rational religion, Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism. And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind. Voltaire was basically a man of reason, who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition. That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine, which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent. And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics, who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base. Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church. For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV, La Henriade, to be published in France. So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead, and in 1726, went and traveled to England. What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different. And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years. He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians, and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture. He decided to write a book about his experience of England. And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733. The French authorities were horrified. The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison. That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture, In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature, in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics. Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange, a handsome building in the heart of the City of London, where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business. "Take a view of the Royal Exchange," Voltaire wrote, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word. At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly, some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: that man has his son’s foreskin cut off, whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child. If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace." Voltaire's message is clear. Religious differences are trivial and separate men, while trade is important and brings them together. His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society, is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant. The Letters Concerning the English Nation, also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material. Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton, and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head, and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire. He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity. After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation, everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture. Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide which was published in 1759 and was a best seller from the moment it appeared. Translated into every possible language, it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment. It's even left its mark on our language Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden have entered common usage. 'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it. And that's the sure mark of a classic. Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition, but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title: "Candide" or "Optimism". The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero. He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism. This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side. Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz, was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil. Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world? To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies, evil is all part of some greater pattern of good: 'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet "Pope" put it. In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all. It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world. You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did, but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century. Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test. Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle, after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations: conscripted into the army, he fights in a war, then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon. Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms: moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame; and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame. Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale. Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this: to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:                   After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva. By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe, and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’. He took up a number of public causes. In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas, was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse to be tortured and then broken on the wheel. The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular, and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry. Voltaire became involved in the case and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute. He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets, culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance, which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture. Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion, and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court. Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire, who had learnt an important lesson about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.     Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’, and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved. In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan, Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’. L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates, everything that he had spent his life fighting: superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind. We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer, one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known. The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression. Many writers made fun of miracles. No one did so hilariously as Voltaire. Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:   It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables: Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer. Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent. Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it, which is what happened. The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906. No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture, so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it. Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values: freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition, belief in reason and tolerance. It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy.

**Transcript**:
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694 His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital, and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student. The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer, or rather to remake his name, as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire. The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason, or the Age of Enlightenment, but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire. So, changing his name was a good call. The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well. Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet. At the age of only 24, he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française. By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart, For under the guise of writing a national epic, he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance. Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly. He was not an atheist. In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity was useful for social cohesion. Voltaire's God had created the world, instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat. This was known as rational religion, Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism. And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind. Voltaire was basically a man of reason, who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition. That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine, which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent. And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics, who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base. Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church. For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV, La Henriade, to be published in France. So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead, and in 1726, went and traveled to England. What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different. And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years. He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians, and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture. He decided to write a book about his experience of England. And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733. The French authorities were horrified. The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison. That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture, In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature, in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics. Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange, a handsome building in the heart of the City of London, where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business. "Take a view of the Royal Exchange," Voltaire wrote, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word. At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly, some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: that man has his son’s foreskin cut off, whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child. If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace." Voltaire's message is clear. Religious differences are trivial and separate men, while trade is important and brings them together. His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society, is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant. The Letters Concerning the English Nation, also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material. Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton, and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head, and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire. He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity. After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation, everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture. Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide which was published in 1759 and was a best seller from the moment it appeared. Translated into every possible language, it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment. It's even left its mark on our language Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden have entered common usage. 'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it. And that's the sure mark of a classic. Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition, but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title: "Candide" or "Optimism". The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero. He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism. This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side. Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz, was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil. Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world? To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies, evil is all part of some greater pattern of good: 'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet "Pope" put it. In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all. It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world. You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did, but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century. Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test. Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle, after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations: conscripted into the army, he fights in a war, then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon. Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms: moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame; and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame. Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale. Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this: to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:                   After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva. By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe, and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’. He took up a number of public causes. In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas, was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse to be tortured and then broken on the wheel. The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular, and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry. Voltaire became involved in the case and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute. He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets, culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance, which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture. Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion, and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court. Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire, who had learnt an important lesson about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.     Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’, and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved. In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan, Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’. L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates, everything that he had spent his life fighting: superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind. We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer, one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known. The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression. Many writers made fun of miracles. No one did so hilariously as Voltaire. Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:   It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables: Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer. Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent. Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it, which is what happened. The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906. No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture, so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it. Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values: freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition, belief in reason and tolerance. It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy.

Although the question is not an exact match, the subject of Candide is closely related to the ground truth MCQ, which asks about the most widely read book of the European Enlightenment (Candide). The options in Question 6 are not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, but the question intent is similar.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 6, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694 His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital, and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student. The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer, or rather to remake his name, as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire. The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason, or the Age of Enlightenment, but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire. So, changing his name was a good call. The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well. Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet. At the age of only 24, he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française. By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart, For under the guise of writing a national epic, he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance. Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly. He was not an atheist. In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity was useful for social cohesion. Voltaire's God had created the world, instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat. This was known as rational religion, Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism. And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind. Voltaire was basically a man of reason, who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition. That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine, which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent. And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics, who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base. Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church. For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV, La Henriade, to be published in France. So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead, and in 1726, went and traveled to England. What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different. And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years. He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians, and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture. He decided to write a book about his experience of England. And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733. The French authorities were horrified. The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison. That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture, In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature, in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics. Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange, a handsome building in the heart of the City of London, where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business. "Take a view of the Royal Exchange," Voltaire wrote, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word. At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly, some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: that man has his son’s foreskin cut off, whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child. If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace." Voltaire's message is clear. Religious differences are trivial and separate men, while trade is important and brings them together. His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society, is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant. The Letters Concerning the English Nation, also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material. Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton, and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head, and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire. He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity. After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation, everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture. Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide which was published in 1759 and was a best seller from the moment it appeared. Translated into every possible language, it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment. It's even left its mark on our language Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden have entered common usage. 'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it. And that's the sure mark of a classic. Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition, but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title: "Candide" or "Optimism". The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero. He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism. This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side. Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz, was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil. Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world? To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies, evil is all part of some greater pattern of good: 'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet "Pope" put it. In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all. It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world. You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did, but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century. Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test. Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle, after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations: conscripted into the army, he fights in a war, then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon. Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms: moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame; and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame. Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale. Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this: to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:                   After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva. By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe, and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’. He took up a number of public causes. In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas, was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse to be tortured and then broken on the wheel. The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular, and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry. Voltaire became involved in the case and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute. He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets, culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance, which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture. Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion, and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court. Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire, who had learnt an important lesson about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.     Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’, and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved. In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan, Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’. L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates, everything that he had spent his life fighting: superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind. We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer, one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known. The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression. Many writers made fun of miracles. No one did so hilariously as Voltaire. Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:   It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables: Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer. Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent. Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it, which is what happened. The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906. No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture, so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it. Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values: freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition, belief in reason and tolerance. It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy.

**Transcript**:
There's a job out there with a great
deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become 
a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court 
in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by
the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be
approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must
formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify
any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,
education, profession, or even native-born 
citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual
to serve. So far, six justices 
have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated
from high school, and another was only 32 years old
when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals
who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint 
liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings
are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,
a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him
to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone
down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that
appointment as "the biggest damned-fool mistake" 
he ever made. Many other factors come up
for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,
ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records
and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews 
the candidate and makes a formal nomination
announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally
turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness
of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,
these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed 
about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues
to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth
any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send
the nomination to the full Senate with a positive 
or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,
or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened
when the Senate majority has been a different political 
party than the president. When the Senate does approve,
it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues 
a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete
the final steps to take the constitutional 
and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer 
justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor
and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge
and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,
or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held
the position, not one has yet been removed from
office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect
the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact
of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme 
Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, "a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard." Of course, not every member of the Court
turns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy
of decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected
by the ultimate judges, time and history.

**Transcript**:
There's a job out there with a great
deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become 
a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court 
in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by
the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be
approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must
formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify
any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,
education, profession, or even native-born 
citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual
to serve. So far, six justices 
have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated
from high school, and another was only 32 years old
when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals
who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint 
liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings
are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,
a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him
to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone
down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that
appointment as "the biggest damned-fool mistake" 
he ever made. Many other factors come up
for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,
ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records
and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews 
the candidate and makes a formal nomination
announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally
turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness
of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,
these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed 
about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues
to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth
any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send
the nomination to the full Senate with a positive 
or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,
or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened
when the Senate majority has been a different political 
party than the president. When the Senate does approve,
it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues 
a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete
the final steps to take the constitutional 
and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer 
justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor
and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge
and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,
or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held
the position, not one has yet been removed from
office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect
the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact
of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme 
Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, "a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard." Of course, not every member of the Court
turns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy
of decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected
by the ultimate judges, time and history.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the characteristics of the 112 United States Supreme Court Justices that have served, specifically which statement is false. The generated MCQs do not directly address this question. However, Question 2 touches on the qualifications for becoming a US Supreme Court justice, which is related to the characteristics of the justices.

Although not a perfect match, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it discusses the unique aspect of the qualifications for becoming a US Supreme Court justice, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
There's a job out there with a great
deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become 
a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court 
in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by
the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be
approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must
formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify
any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,
education, profession, or even native-born 
citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual
to serve. So far, six justices 
have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated
from high school, and another was only 32 years old
when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals
who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint 
liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings
are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,
a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him
to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone
down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that
appointment as "the biggest damned-fool mistake" 
he ever made. Many other factors come up
for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,
ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records
and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews 
the candidate and makes a formal nomination
announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally
turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness
of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,
these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed 
about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues
to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth
any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send
the nomination to the full Senate with a positive 
or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,
or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened
when the Senate majority has been a different political 
party than the president. When the Senate does approve,
it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues 
a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete
the final steps to take the constitutional 
and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer 
justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor
and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge
and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,
or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held
the position, not one has yet been removed from
office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect
the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact
of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme 
Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, "a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard." Of course, not every member of the Court
turns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy
of decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected
by the ultimate judges, time and history.

[Music] They've sat with us at nearly every
table, a pair that's partnered most of the meals ever cooked in western
kitchens. A Yin and Yang, darkness and light. The importance of salt is crystal
clear. Life wouldn't exist without it and if it
did it would taste gross and weird. But out of all the herbs and spices on the
culinary roster how did this ground up gray stuff become
the go-to spice of life. Seriously, why not salt and turmeric or
salt and mustard, salt and cumin, salt and nutmeg, salt and coriander, salt and paprika, salt and cinnamon, salt and allspice, salt and cloves. [Music] Salt, or specifically sodium
chloride. It's the only rock that we eat, the
unlikely joining of a poisonous gas and an explosive-metal and when paired with
water it provides both the incubator and ingredients for life. We use sodium and chloride ions to keep
our cells inflated, to regulate blood pressure and convey electrical nerve
impulses throughout our body. To maintain this we need to consume about six grams
of sodium chloride every day. So salt's culinary and cultural value is no
surprise its history could fill a book, and it has.
A great book by the way. Have you guys read the book Salt: A World History Early hunter-gatherer societies got
all the salt needed from their animal diet To this day the Masai people of East
Africa get theirs from drinking the blood of their livestock. But as human
society is shifted to growing and eating plants, salt became something you either
found or traded for. The earliest sites of salt harvesting date to at least
6,000 BC in China and Europe There's salt in most of the blue wet
stuff covering earth once you boil away or evaporate all that pesky H2O but there's pure sodium chloride in
Earth's crust, if you can find it. Following animal
trails led us to natural salt licks and some of these became our first highways.
Several ancient salt harvesting cities still bear a pinch of history in their
name. Entire economies were built around salt. It was a commodity and currency
that you could eat. Roman warriors deemed worth their salt
where sometimes given a salary. The Roman custom of salting bitter
greens even gave us salad. Although that caesar dressing comes from Tijuana. Today salt is cheap enough to manufacture that many people are in
danger of eating too much. But before the Industrial Age it was scarce enough that
people fought wars over it. It even inspired at least one revolution. Before refrigeration, salting was one way
to keep food from spoiling. Since most harmful bacteria can't grow
in high salt conditions. But obviously salt also changes how we experience our
food. It makes things taste salty but it also accentuates other flavors. Sodium
chloride can chemically block bitter taste receptors and amplify those that
sense sweet, salty, and umami. Depending on when and how its applied to food it can change the very chemistry of how it's
cooked. Salt is probably the most important
ingredient on Earth. But then there's pepper. One spice to rule them all. If you thought salt was interesting,
pepper is is a thing. Black pepper comes from a flowering vine
native to Southeast Asia. It gets its heat from a chemical called
piperine. Rather than capsaicin like those confusingly named fruits of the
chili pepper family. It's been a common ingredient in Indian
cooking for at least four thousand years. But small amounts of black pepper made
their way to Greece, Rome, and even ancient Egypt, where peppercorns were
apparently valuable enough to stuff up the mummified nose of Ramses the second. Pepper became a key commodity in the
spice trade stretching between Asia and Europe, where its main use like other
pungent spices was to mask the flavor of meat that was, shall we say, past its
prime. The extreme distances involved in
trading pepper across the known world translated into extreme prices. To
inflate them further Arab traders invented a myth that pepper gardens were
guarded by serpents which had to be chased away with fire before a harvest. 
Who wouldn't want to put magic snake powder on their food. Throughout the
Middle Ages it was common to see many spices used in the food of the wealthy,
but the enduring popularity of black pepper may owe itself to one picky eater. Its said that Louis XIV
demanded his food lightly seasoned, preferring only salt and pepper be added.
The French cuisine developed then was the basis for much of what we eat today, and now pepper is the spice and I'm sick
of it. Too long we've been forced to look at the world of spice in black and white!
Held prisoner by pepper, unable to gaze upon the full rainbow of flavors and I
say no more! Join me, brothers and sisters, stand
together. We say yes to salt. But let us say anything but pepper! Stay spicy, and curious

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about how following animals to salt licks led to the development of some of the first highways. Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is about how early hunter-gatherer societies obtained salt, which mentions that they got salt from their animal diet. While it does not directly mention highways, it does mention the relationship between animals and salt sources.

However, a closer match is not found in the provided generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 4

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a new generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between following animals to salt licks and the development of highways would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
You may have heard a lot about how dogs have an incredibly keen sense of smell, and it’s true. An average dog’s nose is anywhere between ten thousand to one hundred thousand times more sensitive that yours. So how can dogs with their super sense of smell be so interested in their K9 compatriot’s rear ends? Well folks, the answer is more complex and interesting thank you think. When a dog smells another dog’s butt, it’s actually collecting a bunch of information about the other dog – its diet, its gender, its emotional state and so on. Think of it kind of like speaking with chemicals. In fact, this butt-sniffing action is just one of many examples of chemical communication in the animal kingdom. But what chemicals are packed in a fido’s rear end and where do they come from? We talked to Dr. George Preti of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. Dr. Preti currently studies the complexity of human body odors and pheromones. But back in 1975, he was on the cutting edge of dog butts science. He and his team of researchers examined the anal secretions of dogs and wild coyotes. So on both sides of Sparky’s back door is a stinky, small pouch called an anal sac. This sac houses glands that excrete the chemicals dogs use to get to know each other. The apocrine gland is most responsible for that “dog smell”, but the sebaceous glands also play a part. Petri discovered the primary chemical compounds that produce a dog’s aroma are trimethylamine and a host of short chain acids. As you might expect, anal sac secretions have a very powerful, sharp odor as a result of the acids inside. But a dog’s genetics, diet, and the current state of their immune system can all influence this aroma through chemical changes in the secretions. You’d think the smell of dog poop would overpower Rover’s sensitive snout. But dogs have a second olfactory system in their hyper-sensitive nose called the Jacobson’s organ. The organ is designed specifically for chemical  communication. It has its own set of nerves that lead directly to the brain, so there’s absolutely no interference from other odors. The same organ is used when a dog sniffs a fire hydrant, or anywhere else there happens to be dog pee. So, there you have it folks. Your precious pet isn’t obsessed with other dog’s butts per say. They’re just getting to know each other in a professional aromatic way. Hey speaking of aroma, you should check out this video on why bacon smells so good, because bacon is to people, as butts are to dogs. Thanks for watching folks, don’t forget to subscribe and we’ll see you again soon.

**Transcript**:
You may have heard a lot about how dogs have an incredibly keen sense of smell, and it’s true. An average dog’s nose is anywhere between ten thousand to one hundred thousand times more sensitive that yours. So how can dogs with their super sense of smell be so interested in their K9 compatriot’s rear ends? Well folks, the answer is more complex and interesting thank you think. When a dog smells another dog’s butt, it’s actually collecting a bunch of information about the other dog – its diet, its gender, its emotional state and so on. Think of it kind of like speaking with chemicals. In fact, this butt-sniffing action is just one of many examples of chemical communication in the animal kingdom. But what chemicals are packed in a fido’s rear end and where do they come from? We talked to Dr. George Preti of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. Dr. Preti currently studies the complexity of human body odors and pheromones. But back in 1975, he was on the cutting edge of dog butts science. He and his team of researchers examined the anal secretions of dogs and wild coyotes. So on both sides of Sparky’s back door is a stinky, small pouch called an anal sac. This sac houses glands that excrete the chemicals dogs use to get to know each other. The apocrine gland is most responsible for that “dog smell”, but the sebaceous glands also play a part. Petri discovered the primary chemical compounds that produce a dog’s aroma are trimethylamine and a host of short chain acids. As you might expect, anal sac secretions have a very powerful, sharp odor as a result of the acids inside. But a dog’s genetics, diet, and the current state of their immune system can all influence this aroma through chemical changes in the secretions. You’d think the smell of dog poop would overpower Rover’s sensitive snout. But dogs have a second olfactory system in their hyper-sensitive nose called the Jacobson’s organ. The organ is designed specifically for chemical  communication. It has its own set of nerves that lead directly to the brain, so there’s absolutely no interference from other odors. The same organ is used when a dog sniffs a fire hydrant, or anywhere else there happens to be dog pee. So, there you have it folks. Your precious pet isn’t obsessed with other dog’s butts per say. They’re just getting to know each other in a professional aromatic way. Hey speaking of aroma, you should check out this video on why bacon smells so good, because bacon is to people, as butts are to dogs. Thanks for watching folks, don’t forget to subscribe and we’ll see you again soon.

**Transcript**:
I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want." (Laughter) "I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want." This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go
to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how
to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired
by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community." I said no because I knew
where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,
a little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the music
that I was hearing every day, and that is the music
that girls hear every day when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time in our community?" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book." It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me
their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want." (Laughter) "I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want." This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go
to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how
to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired
by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community." I said no because I knew
where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,
a little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the music
that I was hearing every day, and that is the music
that girls hear every day when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time in our community?" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book." It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me
their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of children Memory's sister had by age 16. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific topic. However, Question 4 mentions the outcome of the speaker's efforts to fight against child marriage in her community, which is related to the speaker's sister's situation.

But, if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the topic of the speaker's sister, I would choose Question 3, which mentions the "Very Special Day" in the initiation camps. This question is related to the context of the speaker's sister's situation, although it does not directly ask about the number of children she had.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but with a very low confidence level.

Index: 3 (with low confidence)

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What was the outcome of the speaker's efforts to fight against child marriage in her community? Options: A. The community leaders refused to listen to her, B. The community leaders agreed to raise the marriage age to 18, C. The community leaders decided to abolish the initiation camps, D. The community leaders decided to provide more education to girls.

However, the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question is needed.

A better match is Question 6: What was the outcome of the child marriage bill in Malawi? Options: A. It was rejected by Parliament, B. It was passed by Parliament and signed into law by the President, C. It was amended to raise the marriage age to 16, D. It was put on hold for further discussion.

But the question is about the outcome of the child marriage bill, not about the rule that Memory helped her community put in place.

Considering all the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not available. However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 4 or Question 6, as they are related to the outcome of the speaker's efforts to fight against child marriage.

However, I can try to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

New Question: What is the minimum age for marriage that Memory and her community advocated for and was eventually made into a rule? Options: A. 15, B. 16, C. 18

This new question matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

Since I have to choose from the existing questions, I will choose Question 4 as the closest match, but I want to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want." (Laughter) "I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want." This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go
to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how
to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired
by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community." I said no because I knew
where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,
a little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the music
that I was hearing every day, and that is the music
that girls hear every day when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time in our community?" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book." It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me
their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of children Memory's sister had by age 16. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific topic. However, Question 4 mentions the outcome of the speaker's efforts to fight against child marriage in her community, which is related to the speaker's sister's situation.

But, if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the topic of the speaker's sister, I would choose Question 3, which mentions the "Very Special Day" in the initiation camps. This question is related to the context of the speaker's sister's situation, although it does not directly ask about the number of children she had.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but with a very low confidence level.

Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go
to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how
to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired
by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community." I said no because I knew
where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,
a little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the music
that I was hearing every day, and that is the music
that girls hear every day when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time in our community?" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book." It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me
their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What was the outcome of the speaker's efforts to fight against child marriage in her community? Options: A. The community leaders refused to listen to her, B. The community leaders agreed to raise the marriage age to 18, C. The community leaders decided to abolish the initiation camps, D. The community leaders decided to provide more education to girls.

However, the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question is needed.

A better match is Question 6: What was the outcome of the child marriage bill in Malawi? Options: A. It was rejected by Parliament, B. It was passed by Parliament and signed into law by the President, C. It was amended to raise the marriage age to 16, D. It was put on hold for further discussion.

But the question is about the outcome of the child marriage bill, not about the rule that Memory helped her community put in place.

Considering all the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not available. However, if I had to choose one, I would choose Question 4 or Question 6, as they are related to the outcome of the speaker's efforts to fight against child marriage.

However, I can try to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

New Question: What is the minimum age for marriage that Memory and her community advocated for and was eventually made into a rule? Options: A. 15, B. 16, C. 18

This new question matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

Since I have to choose from the existing questions, I will choose Question 4 as the closest match, but I want to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
As a wildfire rages through
the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest
flee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank
of a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens
to be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the
wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in,
and the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat
when it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals
to get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make
at each point, and the consequences each choice
leads to. For instance, there are five options
for who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately
get eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions
in the same number of moves. For the sake of time,
we'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays 
and the lion returns, there will be three lions
on the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion
stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion 
already on the left bank. If two wildebeest go,
the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft
will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting
on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest
to cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest
going back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest
on the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest
take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal
on the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending 
the lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either
a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest
on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the
wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion
to raft back and bring his fellow lions over
one by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed
to get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both
lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed
from the fire just in time and begin their new lives 
across the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their
unlikely alliance will last.

**Transcript**:
As a wildfire rages through
the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest
flee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank
of a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens
to be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the
wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in,
and the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat
when it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals
to get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make
at each point, and the consequences each choice
leads to. For instance, there are five options
for who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately
get eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions
in the same number of moves. For the sake of time,
we'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays 
and the lion returns, there will be three lions
on the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion
stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion 
already on the left bank. If two wildebeest go,
the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft
will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting
on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest
to cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest
going back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest
on the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest
take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal
on the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending 
the lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either
a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest
on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the
wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion
to raft back and bring his fellow lions over
one by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed
to get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both
lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed
from the fire just in time and begin their new lives 
across the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their
unlikely alliance will last.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a way to identify a similar question.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the fifth crossing, where two wildebeest cross the river. Although there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches this question, we can look for questions that are related to the crossings or the sequence of events.

One possible similar question is Question 8, which asks about the final step in the solution. Although it's not asking about the fifth crossing specifically, it's related to the sequence of events and the crossings.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are more specific to the crossings and the sequence of events.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 8 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: None (or 8, but not a good match)

**Transcript**:
This is a map of Yellowstone National Park. For the most part the park is in Wyoming, but it extends a bit into Montana and Idaho. This little 50 square miles section in Idaho is what concerns us. It's called the zone of death, because of a loophole that exists in the Constitution of the United States. If someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder. Yellowstone was established in 1872 before Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana joined the Union. It's federal land and always has been, but federal land across the U.S. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts. Except for Yellowstone. And this is where the loophole begins. Law professor Brian C. Kalt points out in his 2005 paper, "The Perfect Crime", that Yellowstone National Park was assigned fully to Wyoming's district court, even though small portions fall into Montana and Idaho. "Unlike every other district, the district of Wyoming includes land in other states." So Kalt asks the question: what happens if you're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile Idaho region of the park? The first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to Cheyenne, the hub of the district court of Wyoming, because the crime technically happened within Wyoming's jurisdiction. But Article 3 Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime. If you're a savvy murderer you'll invoke your right to a trial in Idaho. So they bring you back to Idaho no big deal. "In the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed." This is called the Vicinage Clause. That leaves you with a sort of venn diagram. You have the right to demand jury from that middle area, where the state in which you committed the crime, that's Idaho, overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime: the Wyoming district that has jurisdiction over Yellowstone National Park. And here's the problem: "nobody lives there. There's there's no way for them to give you a trial and so I argue they should have to let you go." This could also happen in the Montana portion of the park, except a few dozen people do live there, so a jury could theoretically be called. Kalt has proposed numerous solutions to Congress to fix the loophole, but they have yet to act. "All they have to do is redraw the district line so that the district of Wyoming is Wyoming, the district of Idaho is Idaho, and the district of Montana is Montana and if they do that this all goes away." So if you're planning a gathering of your adversaries, exes, and debtors, maybe try Yosemite.

**Transcript**:
This is a map of Yellowstone National Park. For the most part the park is in Wyoming, but it extends a bit into Montana and Idaho. This little 50 square miles section in Idaho is what concerns us. It's called the zone of death, because of a loophole that exists in the Constitution of the United States. If someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder. Yellowstone was established in 1872 before Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana joined the Union. It's federal land and always has been, but federal land across the U.S. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts. Except for Yellowstone. And this is where the loophole begins. Law professor Brian C. Kalt points out in his 2005 paper, "The Perfect Crime", that Yellowstone National Park was assigned fully to Wyoming's district court, even though small portions fall into Montana and Idaho. "Unlike every other district, the district of Wyoming includes land in other states." So Kalt asks the question: what happens if you're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile Idaho region of the park? The first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to Cheyenne, the hub of the district court of Wyoming, because the crime technically happened within Wyoming's jurisdiction. But Article 3 Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime. If you're a savvy murderer you'll invoke your right to a trial in Idaho. So they bring you back to Idaho no big deal. "In the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed." This is called the Vicinage Clause. That leaves you with a sort of venn diagram. You have the right to demand jury from that middle area, where the state in which you committed the crime, that's Idaho, overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime: the Wyoming district that has jurisdiction over Yellowstone National Park. And here's the problem: "nobody lives there. There's there's no way for them to give you a trial and so I argue they should have to let you go." This could also happen in the Montana portion of the park, except a few dozen people do live there, so a jury could theoretically be called. Kalt has proposed numerous solutions to Congress to fix the loophole, but they have yet to act. "All they have to do is redraw the district line so that the district of Wyoming is Wyoming, the district of Idaho is Idaho, and the district of Montana is Montana and if they do that this all goes away." So if you're planning a gathering of your adversaries, exes, and debtors, maybe try Yosemite.

This is a map of Yellowstone National Park. For the most part the park is in Wyoming, but it extends a bit into Montana and Idaho. This little 50 square miles section in Idaho is what concerns us. It's called the zone of death, because of a loophole that exists in the Constitution of the United States. If someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder. Yellowstone was established in 1872 before Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana joined the Union. It's federal land and always has been, but federal land across the U.S. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts. Except for Yellowstone. And this is where the loophole begins. Law professor Brian C. Kalt points out in his 2005 paper, "The Perfect Crime", that Yellowstone National Park was assigned fully to Wyoming's district court, even though small portions fall into Montana and Idaho. "Unlike every other district, the district of Wyoming includes land in other states." So Kalt asks the question: what happens if you're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile Idaho region of the park? The first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to Cheyenne, the hub of the district court of Wyoming, because the crime technically happened within Wyoming's jurisdiction. But Article 3 Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime. If you're a savvy murderer you'll invoke your right to a trial in Idaho. So they bring you back to Idaho no big deal. "In the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed." This is called the Vicinage Clause. That leaves you with a sort of venn diagram. You have the right to demand jury from that middle area, where the state in which you committed the crime, that's Idaho, overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime: the Wyoming district that has jurisdiction over Yellowstone National Park. And here's the problem: "nobody lives there. There's there's no way for them to give you a trial and so I argue they should have to let you go." This could also happen in the Montana portion of the park, except a few dozen people do live there, so a jury could theoretically be called. Kalt has proposed numerous solutions to Congress to fix the loophole, but they have yet to act. "All they have to do is redraw the district line so that the district of Wyoming is Wyoming, the district of Idaho is Idaho, and the district of Montana is Montana and if they do that this all goes away." So if you're planning a gathering of your adversaries, exes, and debtors, maybe try Yosemite.

**Transcript**:
Imagine waking up the morning of prom, or
your wedding day, or a big job interview… and sure enough, you look in the mirror to
find your forehead is covered in zits! It’s happened to lots of us. Acne, or acne vulgaris, is the most common
skin disease in humans. It affects about 80% of people at some point
in their lives. Most people get acne between the ages of 11
and 30, but sometimes older people continue to struggle with it, too. Acne happens when follicles and pores become
clogged with dead skin cells and oils. And … it sucks. But by studying how acne forms, doctors have
developed ways to prevent and treat it. It all starts with your skin: a complex organ
made up of two layers and lots of nerves, blood vessels, and glands. Your skin cells regenerate about once a month,
so you constantly have dead skin cells sloughing off, and new skin cells rising to the surface. This whole skin-replacement thing isn’t
much of a problem, on its own. But lots of these dead skin cells come out
through your pores. And pores make things more complicated. Skin pores are essentially just openings for
tiny hairs. Hair follicles, the root ends of the hairs,
are embedded in your skin and surrounded by clusters of sebaceous glands, special glands
that produce sebum. Sebum is that oily, waxy stuff that comes
out of your pores. It helps keep your skin waterproof and moisturized:
it keeps excess water out of your body, and it keeps water already inside you from getting
out through your skin. So, sebum is important. But things can go very wrong if your sebum
production gets out of whack. When your body doesn’t produce enough sebum,
your skin can dry out, making you more susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. But if your body produces too much sebum,
it can build up inside your pores, trap dead skin cells, and cause a blockage. Increased sebum production is one of the major
factors involved in the development of acne. Increased keratin production is another one. Keratin is a protein produced by your hair
follicles. It gives structure to each strand of hair,
as well as the top layer of your skin. But when the hair follicles produce too much
keratin, the extra protein binds together dead skin cells, so they can’t just shed
out of the pore like they normally would. You end up with a blockage that then traps
more dead skin cells, plus sebum. Once the pore is officially clogged, it becomes
a breeding ground for colonies of bacteria — especially Propionibacterium acnes. That’s a species of commensal bacteria,
which basically means it’s friendly. It naturally lives on your skin, and it’s
not harmful … most of the time. The commensal bacteria that make up your microbiome
probably even help prevent other, more harmful bacteria from colonizing on your skin. So having colonies of Propionibacterium acnes
living on you isn’t a bad thing. You want them there — as long as they stay
on the surface of your skin. When the bacteria find their way deep into
skin pores where they don’t belong, that’s when they can cause an infection. And infections often cause inflammation. When you get an infection, your immune system
responds by increasing blood flow to the area and sending extra immune cells and enzymes
to fight off the infection. Different combinations of symptoms cause different
kinds of acne, with names you’ve probably heard before:Blackheads, whiteheads, pimples,
pustules … technically, they all mean different things. The scientific term for a clogged pore is
a comedo, which actually used to mean a parasitic worm. People started using the term to refer to
a clogged pore because the stuff that comes out when you squeeze it looks kind of like
a worm. When the main symptom is just that the pore
is clogged, without much inflammation, that’s either a blackhead or a whitehead. Blackheads are what it’s called when the
comedo is open. The trapped sebum and dead skin cells become
oxidized, which turns the surface of the clogged material into a dark color, kind of like how
silver tarnishes. When the comedo closes, skin cells grow over
the top of the plug and stop this oxidation from happening, so the whitish color of the
sebum shows through. That’s called a whitehead. When there’s a comedo plus an infection
that causes inflammation, that’s a different kind of acne: pimples! The typical reddish bumpy kind are more specifically
called papules. If the inflammation gets really bad, sometimes
the bumps start leaking fluid or bacteria-filled pus. Those kind are categorized as pustules, and
they’re usually a much brighter red, or sometimes white from the oozing fluid. The most severe kind of acne is generally
called cystic acne. That’s when the infection takes root in
the deepest layers of the skin. Sometimes the infection causes more solid
bumps to form, called nodules. And sometimes the infection causes pus-filled
bumps, called cysts. So that’s how acne happens. But what causes it in the first place? What makes healthy pores become clogged, infected,
and sometimes ooze-y? Again, there are a few different factors involved. Genetics seem to be important, for one thing. So if your parents had acne, you’re more
likely to have it too. Hormones also have a huge influence on acne
— specifically, androgen hormones, like testosterone, which influence the development
of both the male and female reproductive systems. Which explains why acne is so much more of
a problem during puberty. Androgen hormones are linked to sebum production. So during puberty, when the hormones are highly
active, there’s an increase in sebum production. Increased stress has been thought to increase
hormone production, as well. So if you find yourself breaking out the day
before a big test, that’s probably why. When you’re stressed, you produce more hormones,
which then increases your sebum production. Since sebum is an oil, a lot of people say
that greasy foods will cause acne. Sometimes you’ll also hear that dairy makes
it worse, or even more specific foods, like chocolate. But the truth is, scientists aren’t really
sure how or whether diet and acne are connected. There have been lots of studies investigating
this, and some do suggest a possible link. But others don’t. We need more comprehensive, controlled trials
with plenty of subjects before we can come to any real conclusions. Doctors do acknowledge that there’s anecdotal
evidence, and they say that if changing your diet has helped with your acne, then it makes
sense for you to stick with it. There just isn’t enough evidence to support
the idea that diet has a role in acne in general. But we do know that exposure to other topical
oils, like some cosmetics or moisturizers, can cause acne by blocking your pores with
extra oils and trapping sebum. It’s easy to avoid the problem, though — just
look for products that say they’re non-comedogenic, which means that they shouldn’t clog your
pores. But the natural oil on your face isn’t really
a problem. You’ll often hear that you should wash your
face a lot to help prevent acne, but acne isn’t caused by dirt or by the natural oil
that’s already on the surface of your skin. And washing your face too much can actually
irritate your skin, making acne worse. To treat acne, the goal is to reduce the factors
that come together to cause breakouts. The one thing you shouldn’t do is pop a
zit. The big risk is that you’ll push the infection
out of the hair follicle and into the surrounding skin, instead of out to the surface. Plus, you’ll irritate the area, causing
more inflammation and making the acne take longer to heal. You might also spread bacteria to non-affected
pores. Instead, treatments try to lower sebum production,
stop dead cells from clumping together in the pore as much, prevent bacterial growth,
and lower inflammation. Treatments can range from mild to aggressive,
depending on how severe the symptoms are. For mild acne like blackheads and whiteheads,
you can usually use topical over-the-counter medications. One of the most effective is benzoyl peroxide,
a chemical compound that’s really good at killing bacteria. It decomposes into super reactive forms of
oxygen, which bind to and destroy the molecules the bacteria need to survive. Another common treatment is salicylic acid,
which doesn’t kill the bacteria, but stops them from replicating. It can also break down skin cells and keratin
to help unclog the pores Inflammatory acne, like papular pimples or
cystic acne, sometimes needs stronger treatment to reduce the inflammation. That usually means prescription meds. ###Antibiotics — the kind that are also
used to treat other bacterial infections, from strep throat to urinary tract infections
— can be used to treat acne. They stop bacterial growth and reduce inflammation. Another kind of treatment involves retinoids,
which are compounds related to vitamin A. Retinoids work by binding to skin cell receptors
to remove dead skin cells and encourage healthy skin cell growth. So retinoids work really well to unclog pores
full of dead skin cells. They’re anti-inflammatory, too. In severe cystic acne cases, stronger retinoids
actually work at the deeper layers of skin to reduce the size of the oil glands so they
produce less sebum. And since hormones are a big factor in sebum
production, using birth control or corticosteroids can regulate female hormones and reduce the
amount of androgen hormones being produced. Fewer androgen receptors at work means less
sebum production, which means less acne. Sometimes, severe, cystic acne will leave
scarring, but there are ways to reduce it. These procedures don’t necessarily treat
or prevent the acne itself, but they can reduce the bumps and scars left over from bad breakouts. Dermabrasion uses a gentle sanding tool to
wear down layers of the skin that have scarred over from cystic acne, but it only works for
people with lighter skin. This procedure has mostly been replaced by
laser resurfacing, which uses laser pulses to remove skin layer by layer until the scar
has smoothed out. Then there are chemical peels, which use compounds
like salicylic acid or retinoic acid to perform what’s basically a controlled injury to
the top layer of skin, killing the top layer of cells. The dead skin cells peel off, revealing healthy
skin cells underneath. Luckily, most people grow out of the acne-ridden
years of puberty, though some people will continue to have acne well into their 40s
and 50s. But even though a bad breakout might make
you self-conscious, it’s normal, it’s treatable, and it’s not life-threatening. So take care of your skin, talk to your doctor
about prescription treatments if you want them, and trust that your acne will probably
get better with age. And then you get to look forward to wrinkles! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall topic of skin and acne, I would say that Question 4: "What is the function of sebum in the skin?" is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ "Is your skin an organ?" in terms of relevance to the topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question type (i.e., a general question about the skin), I would say that none of the generated MCQs match. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

 Question 4 (Index: 4)

Please note that this is not a good match, and a new generated MCQ that directly asks about the skin being an organ would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
Few individuals have influenced the world
and many of today's thinkers like Plato. One 20th century philosopher 
even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy
as a series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's 
greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns
of a few of his best and worst ideas. Plato argued that beyond
our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things
and concepts we see around us. They serve as a sort of instruction
manual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms
is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect
copies of ideal Forms. Plato argued that philosophers
should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate
our misleading reality. While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world
as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's
most vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands
of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we trust
our senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason. It alone provides us with at least
the potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind
amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds. "Featherless bipeds" 
was his official designation. Diogenes the Cynic,
annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class
with a plucked chicken, announcing, "Behold. Plato's man." But back to a few good ideas. Plato is one of the earliest 
political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one 
of the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler
was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered
the craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft 
of contemplating the Forms. In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia
where justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious
balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were
equally able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent
with women, elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's
womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body
and cause illness. This bad idea, also espoused by other
contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds
of years in European medicine. Furthermore, he thought that society
should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince
everyone to follow this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, 
silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers have gone on
to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration
for the dictators that used them. Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one 
of the greatest philosophers in history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who
came after him a place to start. Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas
through writing and experience, and have accepted some
while rejecting others. We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations
of the modern world.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content of the transcript, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that mentions Plato's creation or foundation of an institution. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs meet this criteria.

However, if I had to choose one that is remotely related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, I would say Question 7. According to Plato, who should lead his ideal city? Options: A. A philosopher king, B. A military leader, C. A producer, D. A democratic government, is somewhat related to the topic of institutions and governance. Nevertheless, this question does not mention the creation of the first Western university.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say "None" or "Not Available" would be the most accurate response.

However, the options provided for Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be Question 2: What did Plato argue existed beyond our imperfect world? or the combination of Question 2 and Question 3.

But the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, and since it was indicated that it was not an exact match I looked for another generated MCQ that could match the ground truth MCQ more closely.

A more accurate match is Question 2 and Question 3 are not exact matches, but Question 3 has the closest match 

Upon reviewing the generated MCQs again, I noticed that Question 2 is a more accurate match for the ground truth MCQ.

The correct answer is: 
 Question 2

**Transcript**:
Few individuals have influenced the world
and many of today's thinkers like Plato. One 20th century philosopher 
even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy
as a series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's 
greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns
of a few of his best and worst ideas. Plato argued that beyond
our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things
and concepts we see around us. They serve as a sort of instruction
manual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms
is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect
copies of ideal Forms. Plato argued that philosophers
should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate
our misleading reality. While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world
as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's
most vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands
of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we trust
our senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason. It alone provides us with at least
the potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind
amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds. "Featherless bipeds" 
was his official designation. Diogenes the Cynic,
annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class
with a plucked chicken, announcing, "Behold. Plato's man." But back to a few good ideas. Plato is one of the earliest 
political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one 
of the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler
was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered
the craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft 
of contemplating the Forms. In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia
where justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious
balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were
equally able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent
with women, elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's
womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body
and cause illness. This bad idea, also espoused by other
contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds
of years in European medicine. Furthermore, he thought that society
should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince
everyone to follow this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, 
silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers have gone on
to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration
for the dictators that used them. Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one 
of the greatest philosophers in history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who
came after him a place to start. Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas
through writing and experience, and have accepted some
while rejecting others. We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations
of the modern world.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: According to Plato, who should lead his ideal city? Options: A. A philosopher king, B. A military leader, C. A producer, D. A democratic government**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks about the leader of the ideal city, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the three groups in Plato's ideal society.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the three groups in Plato's ideal society. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the most similar generated MCQ would be a combination of Question 7 and other questions that mention the producers and the military.

If I had to choose one of the generated MCQs, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar, but with a caveat that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Light, bright, and cheerful. It's some of the most familiar
of all early 18th century music. It's been featured in uncounted films
and television commercials, but what is it 
and why does it sound that way? This is the opening of "Spring"
from "The Four Seasons," by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. "The Four Seasons" are famous in part
because they are a delight to the ear. However, even more notable is the fact that 
they have stories to tell. At the time of their publication
in Amsterdam in 1725, they were accompanied by poems describing exactly what feature
of that season Vivaldi intended to capture 
in musical terms. In providing specific plot content
for instrumental music, Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time. If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music, one would find the poetic scenes synchronizing nicely 
with the musical imagery. We are told that the birds welcome
spring with happy song, and here they are doing exactly that. Soon, however, 
a thunderstorm breaks out. Not only is there musical thunder
and lightning, there are also more birds, wet, frightened, and unhappy. In "Summer," the turtle dove sings 
her name "tortorella" in Italian, before a hail storm flattens the fields. "Autumn" brings eager hunters dashing
out in pursuit of their prey. The "Winter" concerto begins with teeth
chattering in the cold before one takes refuge by
a crackling fire. Then it's back out into the storm where there'll be slips 
and falls on the ice. In these first weeks of winter,
the old year is coming to a close, and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration
of the seasons. Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental
program music, as it was known, become popular. By then, larger, more varied ensembles
were the rule with woodwinds, brass, and percussion
to help tell the tale. But Vivaldi pulled it off with just
one violin, strings, and a harpsichord. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested
in complicated fugues. He preferred to offer readily
accessible entertainment to his listeners with melodies that pop back up later
in a piece to remind us of where we've been. So the first movement of the "Spring"
concerto begins with a theme for spring and ends with it, too, slightly varied
from when it was last heard. It was an inspired way 
to attract listeners, and Vivaldi, considered one of the most electrifying 
violinists of the early 18th century, understood the value 
of attracting audiences. Such concerts might feature himself
as the star violinist. Others presented the young musicians
of the Pietà, a Venetian girls' school
where Vivaldi was Director of Music. Most of the students were orphans. Music training was intended not only
as social skills suitable for young ladies but also as potential careers for those who might fail
to make good marriages. Even in the composer's own time, Vivaldi's music served 
as diversion for all, not just for the wealthy aristocrats. 300 years later, it's an approach
that still works, and Vivaldi's music still sounds
like trotting horses on the move.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the time period mentioned.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the approximate time when Vivaldi composed his Four Seasons, with options ranging from the 1600s to the 1900s.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions that "The Four Seasons" was "generations ahead of its time" and that "Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental program music... become popular." This implies that Vivaldi composed his Four Seasons before the 19th century, but it does not directly ask about the composition date.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the time period, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, although it is still not a direct match.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Light, bright, and cheerful. It's some of the most familiar
of all early 18th century music. It's been featured in uncounted films
and television commercials, but what is it 
and why does it sound that way? This is the opening of "Spring"
from "The Four Seasons," by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. "The Four Seasons" are famous in part
because they are a delight to the ear. However, even more notable is the fact that 
they have stories to tell. At the time of their publication
in Amsterdam in 1725, they were accompanied by poems describing exactly what feature
of that season Vivaldi intended to capture 
in musical terms. In providing specific plot content
for instrumental music, Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time. If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music, one would find the poetic scenes synchronizing nicely 
with the musical imagery. We are told that the birds welcome
spring with happy song, and here they are doing exactly that. Soon, however, 
a thunderstorm breaks out. Not only is there musical thunder
and lightning, there are also more birds, wet, frightened, and unhappy. In "Summer," the turtle dove sings 
her name "tortorella" in Italian, before a hail storm flattens the fields. "Autumn" brings eager hunters dashing
out in pursuit of their prey. The "Winter" concerto begins with teeth
chattering in the cold before one takes refuge by
a crackling fire. Then it's back out into the storm where there'll be slips 
and falls on the ice. In these first weeks of winter,
the old year is coming to a close, and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration
of the seasons. Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental
program music, as it was known, become popular. By then, larger, more varied ensembles
were the rule with woodwinds, brass, and percussion
to help tell the tale. But Vivaldi pulled it off with just
one violin, strings, and a harpsichord. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested
in complicated fugues. He preferred to offer readily
accessible entertainment to his listeners with melodies that pop back up later
in a piece to remind us of where we've been. So the first movement of the "Spring"
concerto begins with a theme for spring and ends with it, too, slightly varied

**Transcript**:
In 1997, JK Rowling published Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone. But most of her audience didn’t actually read that book. They read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s stone. or Harry Potter A L'Ecole des Sorciers Harry Potter va Sang-e Jadu Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal [cool humming of "Hedwig's Theme" ] The bewitching Harry Potter books have reached readers in over 200 territories in over 60 languages. The authorized translations came from separate publishing houses with little oversight from the author. So translators were not only tasked with adapting the text from english into their target languages and cultures, but also making assumptions about Rowling’s intentions and translating the spirit of her approach. Their task was particularly challenging because the Harry Potter series is filled with invented words, alliteration, wordplay, and British cultural references. The main characters first names: Harry, Hermione, and Ron mostly stayed the same across languages, with small changes to accommodate different alphabets and phonetics. That’s easy enough for conventional names like Harry Potter. But many of the other proper names in the book carry loaded meanings — meanings that would be lost if it’s not translated. Take Severus Snape. The name invokes severity and sounds like “snake.” So the Italian translator made the jump and named him Severus Piton —which is basically python. In French, he’s Severus Rogue which means Severus "Arrogance". As you can tell, both solutions sacrificed Rowling’s alliteration. The name “Hogwarts” combines two English words, but because the name stayed the same in most languages, those connotations were lost for those readers. In an attempt to preserve Rowling’s approach to the school’s name, the French translator used “Poudlard.” "Pou du lard" means lice of bacon or fat. The Hungarian version went with “Roxfort” a mix of the British university Oxford and Roquefort—a well known blue cheese. The house names and founders, also experienced unique adaptations in some of the target languages. In Catalan the names became: Nícanor Griffindor, Sírpentin Slytherin, Mari Pau Ravenclaw, and Horténsia Hufflepuff. There’s a ton of word play that happens in the Harry Potter books as well. The famous Diagon Alley, a play on the word "diagonally" and the infamous Knockturn Alley from "nocturnally". This type of pun is a real puzzle for translators, and most dropped it in favor of literal translations. The Spanish translator was able to rhyme at least with “callejón diagon.” And translators had several approaches to  Quidditch, an invented game made from the invented words Quaffle, Bludger, and Snitch— the 3 types of balls used in the game. In Spanish, the words were not changed. The French translator kept the word Quidditch but changed the names of the balls. And others changed the game’s name altogether. In Dutch, quidditch is “Zwerkbal.” In Norwegian, it’s “Rumpeldunk." OWLS and NEWTS, standardized tests in the wizarding world, weren’t always able to retain their animal acronyms. But in Swedish their implied meanings remained while the wording was changed. OWLs became Grund Examen i Trollkonst or G.E.T meaning goat in Swedish. And NEWTs were changed to Fruktansvärt Utmattande Trollkarls Test or F.U.T.T. derived from "futtig" meaning measly or mean. The infamous anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle’s name was altered by many translators to achieve the same revelation of “I Am Lord Voldemort.” In Danish, Tom is named "Romeo G. Detlev Jr." and in French he is “Tom Elvis Jedusor” which was extra clever because "Jeu du sort" means “fate riddle.” Culturally, the Harry Potter series is unmistakably British but translating that for a global group of readers wasn’t easy. Some food items were changed to make them less foreign for the target country. Sherbet lemons, a popular candy item in Britain, became krembo, a chocolate covered sweet from Israel. Crisps became chips in the US and in the Arabic version, bacon became eggs. Sometimes a foreign setting undergoes translation too. For the Ukrainian translation, the atmosphere of an English boarding school was swapped out for an orphanage. In the books and films, Hagrid has a provincial west country accent. Hagrid: "No? Blimey Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?" "You're a wizard, Harry." For the Japanese translations, it was replicated by using Tōhoku dialect, which is a pastoral accent from northeastern Japan. Other translators chose to have Hagrid simply speak more informally, while others dropped his accent entirely. Despite translators’ best efforts to remain true to the text some things still were lost in translation. In the mainland Chinese editions of Harry Potter there were footnotes to explain puns and cultural references. The Spanish translator sometimes used italics to signal an invented word with no translation. But in the end, it doesn’t matter if you’re reading Harry Potter and Philosopher’s Stone or the many translations of it. One thing that always seems to translate is the love fans around the world share for tales of "The Boy Who Lived."

**Transcript**:
In 1962, a cave explorer 
named Michel Siffre started a series of experiments where
he isolated himself underground for months without light or clocks. He attached himself to electrodes
that monitored his vital signs and kept track of when he slept and ate. When Siffre finally emerged, the results of his pioneering experiments revealed that his body had kept
to a regular sleeping-waking cycle. Despite having no external cues, he fell asleep, woke up, and ate at fixed intervals. This became known as a circadian rhythm
from the Latin for "about a day." Scientists later found these rhythms
affect our hormone secretion, how our bodies process food, and even the effects 
of drugs on our bodies. The field of sciences studying
these changes is called chronobiology. Being able to sense time helps us do
everything from waking and sleeping to knowing precisely when to catch a ball
that's hurtling towards us. We owe all these abilities to 
an interconnected system of timekeepers in our brains. It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch
telling us how many seconds elapsed, a clock counting the hours of the day, and a calendar notifying us 
of the seasons. Each one is located in 
a different brain region. Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied
on the most primitive clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN
of the hypothalamus. Here's the basics of how we think it works
based on fruitfly and mouse studies. Proteins known as CLK, or clock,
accumulate in the SCN throughout the day. In addition to activating genes
that tell us to stay awake, they make another protein called PER. When enough PER accumulates, it deactivates the gene that makes CLK, eventually making us fall asleep. Then, clock falls low, so PER 
concentrations also drop again, allowing CLK to rise, starting the cycle over. There are other proteins involved, but our day and night cycle may be driven
in part by this seesaw effect between CLK by day and PER by night. For more precision, our SCNs also rely 
on external cues like light, food, noise, and temperature. We called these zeitgebers, German for "givers of time." Siffre lacked many 
of these cues underground, but in normal life, they fine tune
our daily behavior. For instance, as natural morning light
filters into our eyes, it helps wake us up. Traveling through the optic nerve
to the SCN, it communicates what's happening
in the outside world. The hypothalamus then halts
the production of melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. At the same time, it increases the production
of vasopressin and noradrenaline throughout the brain, which help control our sleep cycles. At about 10 am, the body's rising temperature drives up
our energy and alertness, and later in the afternoon, it also improves our muscle activity
and coordination. Bright screens at night can confuse
these signals, which is why binging on TV before bed
makes it harder to sleep. But sometimes we need to be
even more precise when telling the time, which is where the brain's internal 
stopwatch chimes in. One theory for how this works 
involves the fact that communication between a given
pair of neurons always takes roughly the same
amount of time. So neurons in our cortex 
and other brain areas may communicate in scheduled,
predictable loops that the cortex uses to judge
with precision how much time has passed. That creates our perception of time. In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating
additional discovery about this. Every day, he challenged himself 
to count up to 120 at the rate of one digit per second. Over time, instead of taking two minutes,
it began taking him as long as five. Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped
Siffre's own perception of time despite his brain's best efforts
to keep him on track. This makes us wonder what else influences
our sense of time. And if time isn't objective, 
what does that mean? Could each of us 
be experiencing it differently? Only time will tell.

**Transcript**:
In 1962, a cave explorer 
named Michel Siffre started a series of experiments where
he isolated himself underground for months without light or clocks. He attached himself to electrodes
that monitored his vital signs and kept track of when he slept and ate. When Siffre finally emerged, the results of his pioneering experiments revealed that his body had kept
to a regular sleeping-waking cycle. Despite having no external cues, he fell asleep, woke up, and ate at fixed intervals. This became known as a circadian rhythm
from the Latin for "about a day." Scientists later found these rhythms
affect our hormone secretion, how our bodies process food, and even the effects 
of drugs on our bodies. The field of sciences studying
these changes is called chronobiology. Being able to sense time helps us do
everything from waking and sleeping to knowing precisely when to catch a ball
that's hurtling towards us. We owe all these abilities to 
an interconnected system of timekeepers in our brains. It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch
telling us how many seconds elapsed, a clock counting the hours of the day, and a calendar notifying us 
of the seasons. Each one is located in 
a different brain region. Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied
on the most primitive clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN
of the hypothalamus. Here's the basics of how we think it works
based on fruitfly and mouse studies. Proteins known as CLK, or clock,
accumulate in the SCN throughout the day. In addition to activating genes
that tell us to stay awake, they make another protein called PER. When enough PER accumulates, it deactivates the gene that makes CLK, eventually making us fall asleep. Then, clock falls low, so PER 
concentrations also drop again, allowing CLK to rise, starting the cycle over. There are other proteins involved, but our day and night cycle may be driven
in part by this seesaw effect between CLK by day and PER by night. For more precision, our SCNs also rely 
on external cues like light, food, noise, and temperature. We called these zeitgebers, German for "givers of time." Siffre lacked many 
of these cues underground, but in normal life, they fine tune
our daily behavior. For instance, as natural morning light
filters into our eyes, it helps wake us up. Traveling through the optic nerve
to the SCN, it communicates what's happening
in the outside world. The hypothalamus then halts
the production of melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. At the same time, it increases the production
of vasopressin and noradrenaline throughout the brain, which help control our sleep cycles. At about 10 am, the body's rising temperature drives up
our energy and alertness, and later in the afternoon, it also improves our muscle activity
and coordination. Bright screens at night can confuse
these signals, which is why binging on TV before bed
makes it harder to sleep. But sometimes we need to be
even more precise when telling the time, which is where the brain's internal 
stopwatch chimes in. One theory for how this works 
involves the fact that communication between a given
pair of neurons always takes roughly the same
amount of time. So neurons in our cortex 
and other brain areas may communicate in scheduled,
predictable loops that the cortex uses to judge
with precision how much time has passed. That creates our perception of time. In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating
additional discovery about this. Every day, he challenged himself 
to count up to 120 at the rate of one digit per second. Over time, instead of taking two minutes,
it began taking him as long as five. Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped
Siffre's own perception of time despite his brain's best efforts
to keep him on track. This makes us wonder what else influences
our sense of time. And if time isn't objective, 
what does that mean? Could each of us 
be experiencing it differently? Only time will tell.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2011, a team of physicists reported
a startling discovery: neutrinos traveled faster 
than the speed of light by 60 billionths of a second in their 730 kilometer trip from Geneva
to a detector in Italy. Despite six months of double checking,
the bizarre discovery refused to yield. But rather than celebrating 
a physics revolution, the researchers published a cautious paper arguing for continued research in an
effort to explain the observed anomaly. In time, the error was tracked to a single
incorrectly connected fiber optic cable. This example reminds us that real
science is more than static textbooks. Instead, researchers around the world
are continuously publishing their latest discoveries with each paper adding 
to the scientific conversation. Published studies 
can motivate future research, inspire new products, and inform government policy. So it's important that we have confidence
in the published results. If their conclusions are wrong, we risk time, resources, and even our health in the pursuit
of false leads. When findings are significant, they are frequently double-checked
by other researchers, either by reanalyzing the data or by redoing the entire experiment. For example, it took repeated 
investigation of the CERN data before the timing error was tracked down. Unfortunately, there are currently neither
the resources nor professional incentives to double check the more than 1 million
scientific papers published annually. Even when papers are challenged,
the results are not reassuring. Recent studies that examined dozens
of published pharmaceutical papers managed to replicate the results of
less than 25% of them. And similar results have been found
in other scientific disciplines. There are a variety of sources 
for irreproducible results. Errors could hide in their original
design, execution, or analysis of the data. Unknown factors, such as patients' undisclosed condition
in a medical study, can produce results that are 
not repeatable in new test subjects. And sometimes, the second research group
can't reproduce the original results simply because they don't know
exactly what the original group did. However, some problems might stem
from systematic decisions in how we do science. Researchers, the institutions that employ them, and the scientific journals 
that publish findings are expected to produce 
big results frequently. Important papers can advance careers, generate media interest, and secure essential funding, so there's slim motivation for researchers
to challenge their own exciting results. In addition, little incentive exists to publish results unsupportive
of the expected hypothesis. That results in a deluge of agreement
between what was expected and what was found. In rare occasions, this can even lead
to deliberate fabrication, such as in 2013, when a researcher
spiked rabbit blood with human blood to give false evidence that 
his HIV vaccine was working. The publish or perish mindset can also compromise academic journals'
traditional peer-review processes which are safety checks where experts examine submitted papers
for potential shortcomings. The current system, which might involve only one
or two reviewers, can be woefully ineffective. That was demonstrated in a 1998 study where eight weaknesses were deliberately
inserted into papers, but only around 25% 
were caught upon review. Many scientists are working toward
improving reproducibility in their fields. There's a push to make researchers
raw data, experimental procedures, and analytical techniques 
more openly available in order to ease replication efforts. The peer review process can also
be strengthened to more efficiently weed out weak papers
prior to publication. And we could temper the pressure
to find big results by publishing more papers that fail
to confirm the original hypothesis, an event that happens far more than
current scientific literature suggests. Science always has, and always will,
encounter some false starts as part of the collective acquisition
of new knowledge. Finding ways to improve 
the reproducibility of our results can help us weed out those false starts
more effectively, keeping us moving steadily toward
exciting new discoveries.

**Transcript**:
In 2011, a team of physicists reported
a startling discovery: neutrinos traveled faster 
than the speed of light by 60 billionths of a second in their 730 kilometer trip from Geneva
to a detector in Italy. Despite six months of double checking,
the bizarre discovery refused to yield. But rather than celebrating 
a physics revolution, the researchers published a cautious paper arguing for continued research in an
effort to explain the observed anomaly. In time, the error was tracked to a single
incorrectly connected fiber optic cable. This example reminds us that real
science is more than static textbooks. Instead, researchers around the world
are continuously publishing their latest discoveries with each paper adding 
to the scientific conversation. Published studies 
can motivate future research, inspire new products, and inform government policy. So it's important that we have confidence
in the published results. If their conclusions are wrong, we risk time, resources, and even our health in the pursuit
of false leads. When findings are significant, they are frequently double-checked
by other researchers, either by reanalyzing the data or by redoing the entire experiment. For example, it took repeated 
investigation of the CERN data before the timing error was tracked down. Unfortunately, there are currently neither
the resources nor professional incentives to double check the more than 1 million
scientific papers published annually. Even when papers are challenged,
the results are not reassuring. Recent studies that examined dozens
of published pharmaceutical papers managed to replicate the results of
less than 25% of them. And similar results have been found
in other scientific disciplines. There are a variety of sources 
for irreproducible results. Errors could hide in their original
design, execution, or analysis of the data. Unknown factors, such as patients' undisclosed condition

**Transcript**:
Professor Fukanō, the famous 
eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop
in a plane of his own design. Able to travel consistently at the
incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours
to circle the world. There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters
of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey. Let's be honest. The professor probably could have
designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that? Instead, he's devised a slightly more
elaborate solution: building three identical planes
for the mission. In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them
with a few other incredible features. Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount
of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other. The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri
and Orokana will pilot each of the others. However, only one airport,
located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where 
the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground. How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously
for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out 
of fuel and crashing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off
by a hair. The key is to maximize the support
each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel. It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips
in either direction while setting the professor up for a long
unsupported stretch in the middle. Here's his solution. All three planes take off at noon
flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. After 45 minutes, or one-eighth
of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left. Orokana gives 45 to the professor
and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both. With her remaining 45, 
Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge
for a well-deserved break. 45 minutes later, with one-quarter
of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri
are both at 135 kiloliters again. Fugōri transfers 45 
into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90
he needs to return. Professor Fukanō stretches
and puts on his favorite album. He'll be alone for a while. In the meantime, Orokana has been
anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go. As soon as his plane touches the ground,
she takes off, this time flying east. At this point, exactly 180 minutes 
have passed and the professor is at the halfway point
of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left. For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes 
fly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark. Just as the professor's fuel 
is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane. She gives him 45 kiloliters 
of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each. But that's just half of what they need
to make it to the airport. Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,
having refueled, takes off. 45 minutes later, just as the other two
planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel
to each, leaving 45 for himself. All three planes land at the airport
just as their fuel gauges reach zero. As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will
soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how 
to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.

**Transcript**:
Professor Fukanō, the famous 
eccentric scientist and adventurer, has embarked on a new challenge: flying around the world nonstop
in a plane of his own design. Able to travel consistently at the
incredible speed of one degree longitude around the equator per minute, the plane would take six hours
to circle the world. There's just one problem: the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters
of fuel, only enough for exactly half the journey. Let's be honest. The professor probably could have
designed the plane to hold more fuel, but where's the fun in that? Instead, he's devised a slightly more
elaborate solution: building three identical planes
for the mission. In addition to their speed, the professor's equipped them
with a few other incredible features. Each of the planes can turn on a dime and instantly transfer any amount
of its fuel to any of the others in midair without slowing down, provided they're next to each other. The professor will pilot the first plane, while his two assistants Fugōri
and Orokana will pilot each of the others. However, only one airport,
located on the equator, has granted permission for the experiment, making it the starting point, the finish line, and the only spot where 
the planes can land, takeoff, or refuel on the ground. How should the three planes coordinate so the professor can fly continuously
for the whole trip and achieve his dream without anyone running out 
of fuel and crashing? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 According to the professor's calculations, they should be able to pull it off
by a hair. The key is to maximize the support
each assistant provides, not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel. It also helps us to think symmetrically so they can make shorter trips
in either direction while setting the professor up for a long
unsupported stretch in the middle. Here's his solution. All three planes take off at noon
flying west, each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters. After 45 minutes, or one-eighth
of the way around, each plane has 135 kiloliters left. Orokana gives 45 to the professor
and 45 to Fugōri, fully refueling them both. With her remaining 45, 
Orokana returns to the airport and heads to the lounge
for a well-deserved break. 45 minutes later, with one-quarter
of the trip complete, the professor and Fugōri
are both at 135 kiloliters again. Fugōri transfers 45 
into the professor's tank, leaving himself with the 90
he needs to return. Professor Fukanō stretches
and puts on his favorite album. He'll be alone for a while. In the meantime, Orokana has been
anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return, her plane fully refueled and ready to go. As soon as his plane touches the ground,
she takes off, this time flying east. At this point, exactly 180 minutes 
have passed and the professor is at the halfway point
of his journey with 90 kiloliters of fuel left. For the next 90 minutes, the professor and Orokana's planes 
fly towards each other, meeting at the three-quarter mark. Just as the professor's fuel 
is about the run out, he sees Orokana's plane. She gives him 45 kiloliters 
of her remaining 90, leaving them with 45 each. But that's just half of what they need
to make it to the airport. Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,
having refueled, takes off. 45 minutes later, just as the other two
planes are about to run empty, he meets them at the 315 degree point and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel
to each, leaving 45 for himself. All three planes land at the airport
just as their fuel gauges reach zero. As the reporters and photographers cheer, the professor promises his planes will
soon be available for commercial flights, just as soon as they figure out how 
to keep their inflight meals from spilling everywhere.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: How much total fuel (in kiloliters) is contained within all three airplanes when combined at the beginning of this trip?

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more

of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.

**Transcript**:
What if I told you that this 10,000-year-old owl pellet can hold crucial information for preserving the future of Australia's fragile ecosystems? It's true. The specimen along with a 100,000 others
was collected by Field curator Bill Turnbull from the Nullarbor plain region of
southern Australia in the 1950s. And today, its information is being used
to help perserve Australian habitats. Here's the neat thing about this
congealed bird vomit. Nocturnal raptors like owls primarily feed
on rodents and they eat a lot to satisfy their dietary needs. The bones and fur aren't digested
so those parts are regurgitated in the form of pellets. Some owl species return to the same
roosting sites for generations regurgitating pellets in massive piles
over a period of many years and luckily for us, a few of these sites
have been preserved in caves and sheltered from the elements. So in the last tens to hundreds of thousands
of years, these large owl pellet accumulations have given paleontologists a phenomenal record
for what sort of rodents were historically found in the region. And just like how fossil life is stratified in layers
of rock, the ages of rodents too become stratified the deeper you dig in these massive
piles of raptor pellets. So, why are so interested in this information? Well, in the last 200 years since European
settlement in Australia, the country has experienced an alarming
rate of mammal extinction. Greated than any other continent. Since there's no written record of what the
mammal diversity of Australia looked like before Europeans arrived, scientists have
to be creative with interpreting the country's plant and animal history, which in this case means sorting through
these raptor pellets as a great starting point. This gives scientists a way to look at the past in order to help shape the future. And I've got a ton of questions about this, so recently we sat down with Dr. Matthew McDowell,
a post-doctoral researcher at Flinders University in South Australia
to learn more about his work as a paleoecologist and his affection
for raptor pallets. [Dr. McDowell:] This is a sample of the kind of thing
that gets scooped up off of the floor of a cave with the fine dust gotten rid of.
[Emily:] Okay. [Dr. McDowell:] Now, that's usually made up
of things like this – an owl has eaten and then regurgitated before it flies out
to go hunting the next night. We don't have any of the really fresh ones
but they're all very glossy and mucus-covered, and... Yeah. May be gross, but... [Emily:] Kind of fun stuff.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. This has been washed pretty well except
for these chunks on top which have been kept so that you
can see what it looked like. [Emily:] And then, when you have all of this
material, you're taking a pile like this and you're having to sort through all of it to figure out the species under there. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. That's best
done with the teeth. For a couple of reasons. They're the most durable part
of an animal's body, so they last the longest. But they're also complex shapes because different
food is best processed by different types of teeth. And then you get to the stage here where you've only got
the bits that are easily identified which are mainly teeth and jaws. Once we go from these, we identify them,
we work out whether it's the left or the right specimen, what kind of species it is, then it goes to this stage where
it gets put in a vial with a label. [Emily:] With its own number.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, with its own number. Individually, usually individually, sometimes in a lot if you've got millions of them like we do in this case. And that one's got all of its teeth. So that
would be an easy one to identify. [Emily:] What is it?
[Dr. McDowell:] I don't know, I haven't got a microscope. [Emily:] Oh. [Emily:] So, through the process of what seems like a really gross thing, which is sorting through owl vomit, you're able to look at what sort of rodents and
small animals used to be living in an area. [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah.
[Emily:] That's amazing. [Dr. McDowell:] The longest continuous history
that I've done this for is on Kangaroo Island and it's continuously collecting owl pellets
for 150,000 years. [Emily:] Are you serious? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, just piled on top of
each other all the way through time. [Emily:] So how has this information that
you've learned about all of the species and diversity of these caves from
relatively long time ago – how has that changed in the last 200 years
since Europeans have been in Australia? Dr. McDowell:] Oh, that's a great question. Europeans in Australia were, I think justifiably, more interested in feeding their family by clearing a heap of land and planting wheat than they were in what little animals used to live there. You can learn just how much damage
we did to the environment by comparing fossils that are maybe
only 300 or 400 years old to what should be living in the area today. My opinion is that those young fossils are a much better
indicator of what should be living in a park or a place today, than the animals
that are living there right now. [Emily:] Ultimately, what do you do with
this information, now that you know what is in a particular cave or a region? [Dr. McDowell:] Well, we can use it to
work out a number of different things. From very young fossils we can work out
what should be in the national parks, typically in Australia there will be three or
four native mammals in a national park, but if you look at the fossil record, there's 20 to 25 native mammals
that should be there. We can also use it to look at how climates
have changed through time and then we can take that information that
we've learned from conditions in the past being represented by different animals, and we can then make predictive
models to ask ourselves, 'Well, if the climate conditions were like this, what animal would be expected to live in the area in the future?' And that is in terms of conservation
management really important. You know, we can spend a million dollars
on a park and make it beautiful and find that's it's only actually useful
for a hundred years. If I'm doing conservation, I think we should get at least
a thousand years out of our million bucks. [Emily:] What kind of challenges have you run into
when trying to advocate for rodents? Because they're not exactly the most,
uh, charismatic species... I mean people can get behind saving pandas
and tigers, but when you tell them that there's a rare rat living in an area,
how do they respond? [Dr. McDowell:] Yeah, so it is difficult
to champion a rodent, but it's really easy to sell climate change. These little animals live for only a couple of years,
so they're very sensitive to their environment. And they move with the climate
and sort of habitat envelope, by that I mean, you know, if you've got
an overlayer of the right kind of plants, and the right temperature, the right kind of soil, all of those factors play into where an animal will live, and as climate changes, they move. They also do things that help the
community to be supported, so some might cache seeds and
forget where they buried them so some of those seeds will germinate
and grow into plants that had the best possible start, because
that will put them to moist fluffy ground because it's been dug up. Some might shift fungal spores
around, which help other plants... Fungus often grows on plant roots and it's much
better at collecting water than tree roots are. So without a lot of these animals that dig, you lose a lot of that functionality, you know, in a community, and all of the ecology is damaged by that. And it makes it less stable, more
easily broken by climate change. And also, it means that if you want to
keep it, you have to spend more money. So, much better to start with something
that's good and well supported, and, you know, put a little bit of money
into it and keep it ticking over than to go, 'Oh no, we've only got 13 more
northern hairy-nosed wombats left, we have to throw millions of dollars at it
to make sure it doesn't go extinct.' [Emily:] 'Oh noo!' It's kinda late at that point.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. [Emily:] So this cave deposit material,
is this primarily unique to Australia, or is there a chance that there would be
stuff like this found in any country? [Dr. McDowell:] That's a really good question. The animals in different countries change but very
much the processes stay the same. Anywhere you've got cave-dwelling birds of prey, the barn owl particularly lives in every
continent of the world except Antarctica, so nearly everyone's got one, the animals that they're capable of killing quickly and in every continent, they're piling them in caves for us. [Emily:] So there's probably a cave near you.
[Dr. McDowell:] Yeah. Quite right. [Emily:] Full of raptor pellets. Just for the pickin'.

**Transcript**:
With every year, machines surpass humans
in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of. Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out 
what we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines 
and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us
or manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion
be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains
interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman
identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood
the same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile
signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly
getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms,
such as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that
mimic our biological neurons by forming connections 
and exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs
pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify
those samples by adjusting the relative weights
assigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes
at correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences
to shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just
limited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion,
and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence
structure in our writing. You might think that training
neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much 
data is out there, and how quickly modern computers
can process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor
physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect
enough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses
for computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify
facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people
with a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering
using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts
that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help
treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost
automated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network
automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs
is also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy
when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit
our emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify
the people likely to commit crimes before they even make 
a conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances,
like irony, and scales of emotions,
just how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able
to accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear
of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 6, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 3
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
With every year, machines surpass humans
in more and more activities we once thought only we were capable of. Today's computers can beat us
in complex board games, transcribe speech in dozens of languages, and instantly identify almost any object. But the robots of tomorrow may go futher by learning to figure out 
what we're feeling. And why does that matter? Because if machines 
and the people who run them can accurately read our emotional states, they may be able to assist us
or manipulate us at unprecedented scales. But before we get there, how can something so complex as emotion
be converted into mere numbers, the only language machines understand? Essentially the same way our own brains
interpret emotions, by learning how to spot them. American psychologist Paul Ekman
identified certain universal emotions whose visual cues are understood
the same way across cultures. For example, an image of a smile
signals joy to modern urban dwellers and aboriginal tribesmen alike. And according to Ekman, anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, and surprise are equally recognizable. As it turns out, computers are rapidly
getting better at image recognition thanks to machine learning algorithms,
such as neural networks. These consist of artificial nodes that
mimic our biological neurons by forming connections 
and exchanging information. To train the network, sample inputs
pre-classified into different categories, such as photos marked happy or sad, are fed into the system. The network then learns to classify
those samples by adjusting the relative weights
assigned to particular features. The more training data it's given, the better the algorithm becomes
at correctly identifying new images. This is similar to our own brains, which learn from previous experiences
to shape how new stimuli are processed. Recognition algorithms aren't just
limited to facial expressions. Our emotions manifest in many ways. There's body language and vocal tone, changes in heart rate, complexion,
and skin temperature, or even word frequency and sentence
structure in our writing. You might think that training
neural networks to recognize these would be a long and complicated task until you realize just how much 
data is out there, and how quickly modern computers
can process it. From social media posts, uploaded photos and videos, and phone recordings, to heat-sensitive security cameras and wearables that monitor
physiological signs, the big question is not how to collect
enough data, but what we're going to do with it. There are plenty of beneficial uses
for computerized emotion recognition. Robots using algorithms to identify
facial expressions can help children learn or provide lonely people
with a sense of companionship. Social media companies are considering
using algorithms to help prevent suicides by flagging posts
that contain specific words or phrases. And emotion recognition software can help
treat mental disorders or even provide people with low-cost
automated psychotherapy. Despite the potential benefits, the prospect of a massive network
automatically scanning our photos, communications, and physiological signs
is also quite disturbing. What are the implications for our privacy
when such impersonal systems are used by corporations to exploit
our emotions through advertising? And what becomes of our rights if authorities think they can identify
the people likely to commit crimes before they even make 
a conscious decision to act? Robots currently have a long way to go in distinguishing emotional nuances,
like irony, and scales of emotions,
just how happy or sad someone is. Nonetheless, they may eventually be able
to accurately read our emotions and respond to them. Whether they can empathize with our fear
of unwanted intrusion, however, that's another story.

**Transcript**:
HANNAH FRY: So today we're going to talk about rock-paper-scissors and I reckon everyone knows how to play it Scissors beats paper, paper covers rock, rock blunts scissors, so three-- BRADY: Wait, I always thought it smashed them?
Dr. FRY: Oh, I thought it blunts them Actually, if anything, it would probably sharpen them, right? There are three strategies, each one of them loses once and wins once So it looks like there's no strategy that you can play to win, but I'm going to show you about a new paper that had just come out where it gives you some top tips of how to win So it's a group of Chinese scientists, where they run an experiment where they got 360 students to play games of rock-paper-scissors with one another 300 rounds in every game, which took up to 2 hours, which is astonishing, students playing 
rock-paper-scissors for 2 hours Okay, so normally if you have rock-paper-scissors and some of you had rock (R) up there, and rock is beaten by paper (P), which is then beaten by scissors (S) So none of these strategies dominate the other, so really all you can do is play each strategy with an equal probability: 1/3, 1/3, 1/3, okay Now, if you were playing against a computer, who was choosing these perfectly randomly, then that would be the best thing for you to do -- just to pick each strategy with equal probability But the thing is, humans are quite predictably irrational, so to say, in the way they choose their strategy So, in recording what one of these students did in playing rock-paper-scissors the scientists came up with two quite important findings of how people try to beat each other Okay, so the first one is that people who win tend to repeat their strategy So, for example, if I beat you by playing rock, there is a very high chance, or high probability that I will play rock again the second time. If it worked once, it's going to work again, right? The second thing that they found out is that losers change BRADY: To anything in particular, or...?
DR. FRY: Well, so this is a thing that you can exploit, essentially so if you know-- so this gives us, I suppose, two strategies that we can use So the first tip is that if you lose, that means the other person just won, right? So let's imagine that your opponent won by playing rock Now, the chances are that they're going to play rock again, you should then play paper so you just lost on scissors, so you should play paper which means that, basically, even though paper beats rock (so the cycle goes around like this: paper beats rock and so on) you should go the other way around the triangle Let's imagine that you played scissors, the other person played rock, what you should do is you should go backwards around this triangle and play paper the next time because of the high chance that they're going to play rock again So that's the first thing: Go backwards, I guess Or another way to say it is -- essentially, you've just played scissors, they've played rock so play the thing that didn't come up in that, if you lose Now the second thing, is that if you've just won now, they're going to expect you to play the same thing again, right? which means, that they're going to play the thing that you would beat the thing that you just played so you need to play the thing that would beat that would beat the thing that you just played which is equivalent to saying, you need to play what they just played you want to [laughs] let's go again [both laugh] BRADY: I like the easy way better, so you should play what they just played DR. FRY: You should play what they just played, yes So let's imagine, then, you just won -- you played rock, right? -- and you just won on rock that means that they played scissors, now they're going to think that you're going to play rock again, which means that they're going to play paper, which means that you should play scissors and so again, you basically end up going backwards around the triangle so play what they just played, and the game go backwards or an easier way to say it then is to play what they just played. So in general, if you're cycling through rock-paper-scissors, your best strategy is to go backwards and go scissors-paper-rock, and cycle through that way BRADY: How much-- Is this mathematics or is this psychology? This is-- I can't tell if this is all to do with probability, or it's just about knowing how humans think DR. FRY: Well, I think that a balance of the two, so it's rooted in game theory which is the mathematics of looking at decisions and strategies, so in any situation where you're competing against someone, and you best move is dependent on what the other person is playing, you can frame in game theory BRADY: Numberphile is brought to you by the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute But this video has also been sponsored by Squarespace Squarespace is a great service for designing, hosting, creating your own websites and as probably mentioned before, I use it myself No matter what you want to do -- a blog, podcast, shop, portfolio, Squarespace is as easy as 1-2-3 But it's not just amateurs who benefit from Squarespace and all its brilliant templates, Their developer platform will also give you full control over all the code, letting you tweak the HTML, CSS and Javascript into your heart's content And if you like stats, and you're watching Numberphile, you'll really like watching Squarespace's analytics, their 3rd party integrations, and their easy-to-use commerce If you'd like to find out more, go to squarespace.com/numberphile you can try it all out, you can set up your own site, and you can do it all for free, no credit card required And then if you do like it, and decide to opt in, use the offer code NUMBERPHILE and you get 10% off So thank you very much to Squarespace for supporting this video and thank you to you for watching it

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 9
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You work at the college library. You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280
different books arrives. The books have been dropped of
in one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting 
system is broken. To make matters worse,
classes start tomorrow, which means that 
first thing in the morning, students will show up in droves
looking for these books. How can you get them all sorted in time? One way would be to start at one end
of the line with the first pair of books. If the first two books are in order,
then leave them as they are. Otherwise, swap them. Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach 
the end of the line. At some point, you'll come across
the book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every
subsequent book, moving it down the line until it
reaches the end where it belongs. Then, start from the beginning
and repeat the process to get the second to last book
in its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted. This approach is called Bubble Sort. It's simple but slow. You'd make 1,279 comparisons
in the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons. If each took just one second,
the process would take over nine days. A second strategy would be to start
by sorting just the first two books. Then, take the third book and compare it
with the book in the second spot. If it belongs before the second book,
swap them, then compare it 
with the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed. Now you've sorted the first three books. Keep adding one book at a time
to the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book
with the one before it until it's correctly placed
among the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't
require comparing every pair of books. On average, we'd expect to only need
to compare each book to half of the books that came before it. In that case, the total 
number of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days. You're still doing 
way too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it
to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books 
that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it
on its right. You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare 
any of the books on the left to any of the ones 
on the right ever again. Now, looking only 
at the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come
before it from those that come after it. You can keep creating 
sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using
another strategy, like Insertion Sort. Each round of partitioning requires
about 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten
would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds. Sorting these sub-lines would add
about 22 seconds each. All in all, this method 
known as QuickSort could sort the books 
in under three and a half hours. But there's a catch. Your partitions could end up lopsided,
saving no time at all. Luckily, this rarely happens. That's why QuickSort is one of the most
efficient strategies used by programmers today. They use it for things like sorting items
in an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations
close to a given location sorted by distance. In your case, you're done quick sorting
with time to spare. Just another high-stakes day 
in the library.

way too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it
to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books 
that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it
on its right. You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare 
any of the books on the left to any of the ones 
on the right ever again. Now, looking only 
at the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come
before it from those that come after it. You can keep creating 
sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using
another strategy, like Insertion Sort. Each round of partitioning requires
about 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten
would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds. Sorting these sub-lines would add
about 22 seconds each. All in all, this method 
known as QuickSort could sort the books 
in under three and a half hours. But there's a catch. Your partitions could end up lopsided,
saving no time at all. Luckily, this rarely happens. That's why QuickSort is one of the most
efficient strategies used by programmers today. They use it for things like sorting items
in an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations
close to a given location sorted by distance. In your case, you're done quick sorting
with time to spare. Just another high-stakes day 
in the library.

**Transcript**:
You work at the college library. You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280
different books arrives. The books have been dropped of
in one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting 
system is broken. To make matters worse,
classes start tomorrow, which means that 
first thing in the morning, students will show up in droves
looking for these books. How can you get them all sorted in time? One way would be to start at one end
of the line with the first pair of books. If the first two books are in order,
then leave them as they are. Otherwise, swap them. Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach 
the end of the line. At some point, you'll come across
the book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every
subsequent book, moving it down the line until it
reaches the end where it belongs. Then, start from the beginning
and repeat the process to get the second to last book
in its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted. This approach is called Bubble Sort. It's simple but slow. You'd make 1,279 comparisons
in the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons. If each took just one second,
the process would take over nine days. A second strategy would be to start
by sorting just the first two books. Then, take the third book and compare it
with the book in the second spot. If it belongs before the second book,
swap them, then compare it 
with the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed. Now you've sorted the first three books. Keep adding one book at a time
to the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book
with the one before it until it's correctly placed
among the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't
require comparing every pair of books. On average, we'd expect to only need
to compare each book to half of the books that came before it. In that case, the total 
number of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days. You're still doing 
way too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it
to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books 
that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it

**Transcript**:
A boy named Prince Tamino
runs through a dark wood pursued by a dragon. Just as it rears up to devour him, three mysterious ladies appear and slay the dragon 
with their fierce battle cry. So begins Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
"Die Zauberflöte," or "The Magic Flute." This fantasy singspiel, a type of folk opera with music
and dialogue, premiered in 1791 in Vienna. Though it may seem 
like a childish fairytale, this intricate opera is full of
subversive symbolism, and it's now regarded as one of the most
influential operas in history. Tamino's run in with the dragon
is only the start of his journey. The three women summon their leader,
the Queen of the Night. She, in turn, sends Tamino on a quest
to rescue her daughter Pamina from the evil sorcerer, Sarastro. And to help him on his journey,
she gives him the titular magic flute. Tamino eventually finds Pamina
at Sarastro's temple, but behind enemy lines, Tamino and Pamina learn 
that they're on the wrong side. The Queen of Night actually wants
to plunge the world into darkness. Everything Tamino thought he knew
was wrong, filling him with doubt and confusion. So, a new quest begins for Tamino
and Pamina. They must pass three trials of wisdom, and only then can the day 
vanquish the night. Helped by the flute's magic power, the two youths overcome these trials
and the Queen's attempts to sabotage them. They're finally initiated into the temple
having restored balance to the kingdom. Many elements in this peculiar fairytale were inspired by Mozart's involvement 
in Freemasonry, a network of fraternal organizations
throughout Europe. Much of their history, symbolism,
and ritual came from the Middle Ages. But the Freemasons of Mozart's time were also influenced 
by 18th century European ideals - rationalism, humanism, and skepticism
towards traditional authorities, like monarchy and the church. The symbols of Freemasonry 
and these ideals of the Enlightenment are found throughout the opera. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,
that's because it sort of was at the time, but it's now taken quite seriously and has been the subject of considerable
scholarly publication. For example, some Mozart scholars
believe the Queen of the Night symbolizes Maria Theresa,
the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire who opposed Freemasonry
and banned it in Austria. While there continues to be debate
as to the specific meaning, interpretation, and location of these masonic references, scholars agree that they're there
and are fully intentional. One of these symbols is the number three, which represented balance and order
to Freemasons. Now the number three is, of course,
easy to find in any work of storytelling, but it's particularly prominent
in "The Magic Flute": three trials, three ladies, three spirits, and three doors, much of the music 
is written in E-flat major, which has three flats 
in its key signature, and historically, masonic rituals
began with three knocks. The opera references them by opening
with three majestic chords complete with dramatic pauses. Those chords, which reoccur 
throughout the opera, serve another purpose. They capture the dramatic 
arc of the opera in miniature. The first chord, E-flat major,
is in its most natural root position, simple and unadorned. It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino, who, in his naiveté, accepts everything
the Queen and her ladies say without question. The second chord is C minor, a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's 
sadness and doubt in the middle of the opera. That's when his world and notions of
good and evil get turned on their heads. And good and evil are just two of the
opera's extreme opposites. It features some of the highest
and lowest notes in opera, day and night, simple hummable melodies
and complicated forward-looking music. The opera's central theme concerns
balancing these extremes to achieve perfect harmony. To reflect this, the final chord in the opening
restores musical order. It returns to the triumphant E-flat major, the same chord it started with
but inverted, meaning Mozart moved the bottom note
to the top. Although it retains its original harmony,
the chord sounds higher, pointing towards enlightenment. That's similar to Tamino, who in passing his trials restores balance
to the kingdom while growing stronger, wiser,
and more complete.

**Transcript**:
A boy named Prince Tamino
runs through a dark wood pursued by a dragon. Just as it rears up to devour him, three mysterious ladies appear and slay the dragon 
with their fierce battle cry. So begins Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's
"Die Zauberflöte," or "The Magic Flute." This fantasy singspiel, a type of folk opera with music
and dialogue, premiered in 1791 in Vienna. Though it may seem 
like a childish fairytale, this intricate opera is full of
subversive symbolism, and it's now regarded as one of the most
influential operas in history. Tamino's run in with the dragon
is only the start of his journey. The three women summon their leader,
the Queen of the Night. She, in turn, sends Tamino on a quest
to rescue her daughter Pamina from the evil sorcerer, Sarastro. And to help him on his journey,
she gives him the titular magic flute. Tamino eventually finds Pamina
at Sarastro's temple, but behind enemy lines, Tamino and Pamina learn 
that they're on the wrong side. The Queen of Night actually wants
to plunge the world into darkness. Everything Tamino thought he knew
was wrong, filling him with doubt and confusion. So, a new quest begins for Tamino
and Pamina. They must pass three trials of wisdom, and only then can the day 
vanquish the night. Helped by the flute's magic power, the two youths overcome these trials
and the Queen's attempts to sabotage them. They're finally initiated into the temple
having restored balance to the kingdom. Many elements in this peculiar fairytale were inspired by Mozart's involvement 
in Freemasonry, a network of fraternal organizations
throughout Europe. Much of their history, symbolism,
and ritual came from the Middle Ages. But the Freemasons of Mozart's time were also influenced 
by 18th century European ideals - rationalism, humanism, and skepticism
towards traditional authorities, like monarchy and the church. The symbols of Freemasonry 
and these ideals of the Enlightenment are found throughout the opera. If this sounds like a conspiracy theory,
that's because it sort of was at the time, but it's now taken quite seriously and has been the subject of considerable
scholarly publication. For example, some Mozart scholars
believe the Queen of the Night symbolizes Maria Theresa,
the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire who opposed Freemasonry
and banned it in Austria. While there continues to be debate
as to the specific meaning, interpretation, and location of these masonic references, scholars agree that they're there
and are fully intentional. One of these symbols is the number three, which represented balance and order
to Freemasons. Now the number three is, of course,
easy to find in any work of storytelling, but it's particularly prominent
in "The Magic Flute": three trials, three ladies, three spirits, and three doors, much of the music 
is written in E-flat major, which has three flats 
in its key signature, and historically, masonic rituals
began with three knocks. The opera references them by opening
with three majestic chords complete with dramatic pauses. Those chords, which reoccur 
throughout the opera, serve another purpose. They capture the dramatic 
arc of the opera in miniature. The first chord, E-flat major,
is in its most natural root position, simple and unadorned. It echoes the child-like Prince Tamino, who, in his naiveté, accepts everything
the Queen and her ladies say without question. The second chord is C minor, a sour sonority that mirrors Tamino's 
sadness and doubt in the middle of the opera. That's when his world and notions of
good and evil get turned on their heads. And good and evil are just two of the
opera's extreme opposites. It features some of the highest
and lowest notes in opera, day and night, simple hummable melodies
and complicated forward-looking music. The opera's central theme concerns
balancing these extremes to achieve perfect harmony. To reflect this, the final chord in the opening
restores musical order. It returns to the triumphant E-flat major, the same chord it started with
but inverted, meaning Mozart moved the bottom note
to the top. Although it retains its original harmony,
the chord sounds higher, pointing towards enlightenment. That's similar to Tamino, who in passing his trials restores balance
to the kingdom while growing stronger, wiser,
and more complete.

while browsing the latest dating app have you ever stopped and wondered why are so many of the good-looking people jerks well it turns out there's a simple explanation for this phenomenon if we make a little graph of niceness versus good lucks we can start to get an answer first we have to assume that people are equally spread across this chart meaning some people are mean and ugly some people are ugly and nice some are good-looking and mean and some are good-looking and nice of course this is based on your subjective taste in what you find beautiful and nice now if you think about it you probably have zero interest in people who you find mean and ugly meaning your pool of potential mates gets a bit smaller and truthfully you probably prefer a certain combination of niceness and good looks ultimately we're left with a triangle of people you find acceptable and give attention to in the first place but now 100 percent of the people left in your pool who aren't that attractive you are nice they have to be otherwise you wouldn't pay them any attention after all if somebody is nice you are less likely to be critical of their appearance which brings down the average of nice people's looks to the same token almost half of the people that are beautiful to you are mean again if somebody is mean you likely require that they be really attractive for you to give them any attention which makes it seem like more attractive people are jerks if we take this a step further we can assume that people who are both hot and nice are the best catches and get swept off the market more quickly further increasing your perception and bias we can see a similar thing happened with food do you ever wonder why it seems that healthy foods just don't taste as good well let's use our chart yumminess versus healthiness of course in reality this chart probably isn't evenly distributed because food is often created to specifically taste good so the right-hand side of the graph is likely more dense regardless we can take out all the foods that don't taste good and aren't even good for you because why would you bother eating them but of the foods leftover that you do eat now 100% of the foods that don't taste good are good for you just like the dating graph it's because of the people or the foods that you don't pay attention to that your perception become skewed back to dating and it's true from your perspective good-looking people are more likely to be jerks but it's because of who you're paying attention to in the first place you simply ignore the ugly jerks special thanks to blue apron for supporting this episode and giving the first 300 people who sign up with our link three free meals on their first order blue apron allows you to create delicious chef design recipes by delivering fresh farm ingredients to your doorstep in the exact right proportions for cooking it's a fun and simple way to try new recipes every week which take less than 40 minutes to make instead of doing the same old thing you can get cooking by using the link in our description and subscribe for more weekly science videos

**Transcript**:
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694 His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital, and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student. The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer, or rather to remake his name, as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire. The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason, or the Age of Enlightenment, but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire. So, changing his name was a good call. The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well. Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet. At the age of only 24, he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française. By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart, For under the guise of writing a national epic, he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance. Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly. He was not an atheist. In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity was useful for social cohesion. Voltaire's God had created the world, instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat. This was known as rational religion, Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism. And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind. Voltaire was basically a man of reason, who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition. That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine, which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent. And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics, who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base. Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church. For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV, La Henriade, to be published in France. So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead, and in 1726, went and traveled to England. What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different. And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years. He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians, and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture. He decided to write a book about his experience of England. And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733. The French authorities were horrified. The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison. That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture, In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature, in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics. Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange, a handsome building in the heart of the City of London, where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business. "Take a view of the Royal Exchange," Voltaire wrote, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word. At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly, some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: that man has his son’s foreskin cut off, whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child. If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace." Voltaire's message is clear. Religious differences are trivial and separate men, while trade is important and brings them together. His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society, is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant. The Letters Concerning the English Nation, also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material. Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton, and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head, and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire. He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity. After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation, everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture. Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide which was published in 1759 and was a best seller from the moment it appeared. Translated into every possible language, it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment. It's even left its mark on our language Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden have entered common usage. 'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it. And that's the sure mark of a classic. Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition, but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title: "Candide" or "Optimism". The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero. He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism. This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side. Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz, was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil. Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world? To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies, evil is all part of some greater pattern of good: 'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet "Pope" put it. In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all. It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world. You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did, but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century. Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test. Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle, after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations: conscripted into the army, he fights in a war, then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon. Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms: moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame; and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame. Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale. Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this: to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:                   After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva. By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe, and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’. He took up a number of public causes. In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas, was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse to be tortured and then broken on the wheel. The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular, and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry. Voltaire became involved in the case and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute. He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets, culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance, which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture. Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion, and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court. Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire, who had learnt an important lesson about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.     Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’, and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved. In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan, Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’. L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates, everything that he had spent his life fighting: superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind. We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer, one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known. The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression. Many writers made fun of miracles. No one did so hilariously as Voltaire. Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:   It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables: Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer. Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent. Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it, which is what happened. The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906. No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture, so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it. Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values: freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition, belief in reason and tolerance. It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy.

**Transcript**:
François-Marie Arouet was born in Paris in 1694 His father, a well-established lawyer, sent him to the best school in the capital, and by all accounts, he was a brilliant student. The young Arouet, decided at an early age to make his name as a writer, or rather to remake his name, as the first thing he did was to change his name to Voltaire. The 18th century is often referred to as the Age of Reason, or the Age of Enlightenment, but sometimes more fairly simply as the Age of Voltaire. So, changing his name was a good call. The age of Arouet, which is not of work quite as well. Voltaire was precociously talented as a poet. At the age of only 24, he had his first verse tragedy performed at the Comédie-Française. By then, he'd already begun work on an epic poem about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, about the French religious civil wars of the 16th century, by pragmatically converting from Protestantism to Catholicism. This was to be a subject dear to Voltaire's heart, For under the guise of writing a national epic, he was dwelling at length on the bloody consequences of religious intolerance. Right from the start, Voltaire's views on religion were expressed robustly. He was not an atheist. In part, because he thought that some minimal belief in a deity was useful for social cohesion. Voltaire's God had created the world, instilled in us a sense of good and evil and then basically taken a back seat. This was known as rational religion, Or in the 18th century called natural religion, or deism. And it had no truck with metaphysics of any kind. Voltaire was basically a man of reason, who loathed fanaticism, idolatry and superstition. That men can kill each other to defend some bit of religious doctrine, which they scarcely understand, is something he found repellent. And he reserved his greatest hatred for the clerics, who exploited the credulity of believers to maintain their own power base. Voltaire wanted religion but not the Church. For obvious reasons, the Catholic authorities were not keen for Voltaire's poem about Henry IV, La Henriade, to be published in France. So Voltaire decided to go and publish it in London instead, and in 1726, went and traveled to England. What began as a business trip soon turned, however, into something quite different. And Voltaire ended up staying in England for some two and a half years. He learned to speak English fluently, got to know writers and politicians, and became a great admirer of English Protestant culture. He decided to write a book about his experience of England. And the Letters Concerning the English Nation appeared first in English in 1733. The French authorities were horrified. The book was censored and Voltaire only narrowly avoided prison. That's because the book presented an informal portrait of English culture, In a witty and ironical style looking in turn at religion, politics, science and literature, in ways that were critical implicitly of French culture and politics. Here, for example, is how Voltaire presents the Royal Exchange, a handsome building in the heart of the City of London, where merchants from across the world would meet to transact business. "Take a view of the Royal Exchange," Voltaire wrote, where the representatives of all nations meet for the benefit of mankind. There the Jew, the Muhammadan and a Christian transact together as though they all profess the same religion, and give the name of infidel to none but the bankrupts. There the Presbyterian confides in the Anabaptist, and the Churchman depends on the Quaker’s word. At the breaking up of this pacific and free assembly, some will withdraw to the synagogue, and others to take a glass. This man goes and is baptised in a great tub, in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: that man has his son’s foreskin cut off, whilst a set of Hebrew words (quite unintelligible to him) are mumbled over his child. If one religion only were allowed in England, the government would very possibly become arbitrary; if there were but two, the people would cut one another’s throats; but as there as such a multitude, they all live happy and in peace." Voltaire's message is clear. Religious differences are trivial and separate men, while trade is important and brings them together. His conclusion, that the plurality of religions in England leads to a more peaceful society, is, of course, a covert criticism of France, where the Catholic Church was so dominant. The Letters Concerning the English Nation, also discuss Locke and Newton, thinkers then poorly known in France The subject-matter might seem challenging, but Voltaire is a past master popularising difficult material. Ask any schoolchild today what they know about Newton, and they'll tell you about the apple falling on his head, and the survival of this anecdote is due entirely to Voltaire. He heard it from Newton's niece and immediately understood that this simple homely image was the perfect way of conveying the simplicity of Newton's explanation of the force of gravity. After Voltaire used the story in his Letters Concerning the English Nation, everyone remembered it and Voltaire left his mark on English popular culture. Voltaire struggled with the question of good and evil the problem at the heart of his best-known work, Candide which was published in 1759 and was a best seller from the moment it appeared. Translated into every possible language, it remains the most widely read work of the European Enlightenment. It's even left its mark on our language Expressions like 'pour encourager les autres' to encourage the others or 'il faut cultiver le jardin', we must cultivate our garden have entered common usage. 'In the best of all possible worlds', yes, that's another one speakers of French or English quote Candide, without even realising it. And that's the sure mark of a classic. Candide is a timeless work, as satire of the human condition, but it's also work of the Enlightenment and its philosophical theme is announced in the title: "Candide" or "Optimism". The hero of Candide, as his name tells us, is an innocent anti-hero. He is in thrall to his tutor, Pangloss, who preaches the philosophy of Optimism. This is not 'optimism' in the modern sense of looking on the bright side. Optimism, spelled with a capital O and as expounded by the German philosopher, Leibniz, was an attempt to answer the age-old problem of evil. Why, if God is good, does he permit the existence of evil in the world? To which the 18th century Leibnizian Optimist replies, evil is all part of some greater pattern of good: 'All partial evil, universal good' as the English poet "Pope" put it. In other words, evil doesn't really exist at all. It's just something which man imagines because of his limited view of the world. You might think this sounds like a bit of a confidence trick, Voltaire certainly did, but this idea did find widespread acceptance in the 18th century. Candide's great mission was to put this philosophy to the test. Ejected from his comfortable home in an obscure German castle, after trying to seduce the Baron's beautiful daughter, Cunégonde, Voltaire's hero, Candide, undergoes many trials and tribulations: conscripted into the army, he fights in a war, then deserts, only to find himself a witness to an earthquake in Lisbon. Candide is repeatedly brought face to face with evil in its most extreme forms: moral evil, in the case of the earthquake, where man is not apparently to blame; and most of all human evil, such as the war, where man is very definitely to blame. Pangloss's breezy Optimism is clearly an inadequate response to enormities of evil on this scale. Eventually, even Candide comes to realize this: to quote from the book, 'And sometimes Pangloss would say to Candide:                   After 1760, Voltaire took up residence in the château at Ferney, just outside Geneva. By now, he was the most famous living writer in Europe, and he became widely known as the ‘patriarch of Ferney’. He took up a number of public causes. In 1761, a Protestant merchant Jean Calas, was accused of murdering his son and sentenced by the judges of Toulouse to be tortured and then broken on the wheel. The legal processes were, to say the least, irregular, and the suspicions grew that the judges in his Catholic city had acted with excessive zeal out of religious bigotry. Voltaire became involved in the case and mounted an energetic campaign to rehabilitate Calas’ memory and help the members of his family, who had been left destitute. He wrote letters to those in authority and published a stream of pamphlets, culminating in 1763 in his Traité sur la tolérance, which begins with the historical facts of the Calas case and broadens out into a history of religious intolerance in European culture. Voltaire's writings had enormous impact on public opinion, and eventually the judges in Paris quashed the judgment of the Toulouse court. Too late to save Calas, but a huge victory for Voltaire, who had learnt an important lesson about how change could be brought about through the pressure of public opinion.     Voltaire said of himself that he ‘wrote to act’, and he wanted his writings to change the way people thought and behaved. In leading his crusades against fanaticism, he even invented a campaign slogan, Ecrasez l’Infâme!, which translates roughly as ‘Crush the despicable!’. L’Infâme stands here for everything that Voltaire hates, everything that he had spent his life fighting: superstition, intolerance, irrational behaviour of every kind. We should never forget that Voltaire was also a brilliant writer, one of the greatest stylist the French language has ever known. The power of his ideas had a lot to do with the power of his expression. Many writers made fun of miracles. No one did so hilariously as Voltaire. Always, Voltaire had an ear for the telling phrase:   It's a good line, even in English, and better still in the original French where it is more memorable because it is a classical alexandrine line in 12 syllables: Si Dieu n’existait pas, il faudrait l’inventer. Voltaire's legacy in our present debates about religious toleration remain extremely potent. Hardly a week passes without an article in the press quoting: ‘I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ This rallying cry of tolerant multiculturalism is so potent that if Voltaire hadn't said it, we would have had to invent it, which is what happened. The expression was invented by an English woman in 1906. No matter, it expresses a truth which is fundamentally important to our culture, so we have adopted the phrase and decided that Voltaire said it. Voltaire, his name has become synonymous with a set of liberal values: freedom of speech, rejection of bigotry and superstition, belief in reason and tolerance. It's a unique, and nowadays, extremely precious legacy.

**Transcript**:
There's a job out there with a great
deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become 
a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court 
in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by
the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be
approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must
formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify
any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,
education, profession, or even native-born 
citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual
to serve. So far, six justices 
have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated
from high school, and another was only 32 years old
when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals
who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint 
liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings
are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,
a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him
to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone
down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that
appointment as "the biggest damned-fool mistake" 
he ever made. Many other factors come up
for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,
ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records
and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews 
the candidate and makes a formal nomination
announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally
turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness
of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,
these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed 
about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues
to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth
any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send
the nomination to the full Senate with a positive 
or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,
or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened
when the Senate majority has been a different political 
party than the president. When the Senate does approve,
it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues 
a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete
the final steps to take the constitutional 
and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer 
justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor
and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge
and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,
or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held
the position, not one has yet been removed from
office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect
the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact
of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme 
Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, "a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard." Of course, not every member of the Court
turns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy
of decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected
by the ultimate judges, time and history.

**Transcript**:
There's a job out there with a great
deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become 
a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court 
in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by
the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be
approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must
formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify
any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age,
education, profession, or even native-born 
citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual
to serve. So far, six justices 
have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated
from high school, and another was only 32 years old
when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals
who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint 
liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings
are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower,
a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him
to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone
down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that
appointment as "the biggest damned-fool mistake" 
he ever made. Many other factors come up
for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties,
ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records
and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews 
the candidate and makes a formal nomination
announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally
turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness
of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration,
these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed 
about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues
to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth
any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send
the nomination to the full Senate with a positive 
or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings,
or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened
when the Senate majority has been a different political 
party than the president. When the Senate does approve,
it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues 
a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete
the final steps to take the constitutional 
and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer 
justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor
and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge
and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement,
or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held
the position, not one has yet been removed from
office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect
the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact
of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme 
Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R. Kaufman, "a paragon of virtue, an intellectual Titan, and an administrative wizard." Of course, not every member of the Court
turns out to be an exemplar of justice. Each leaves behind a legacy
of decisions and opinions to be debated and dissected
by the ultimate judges, time and history.

**Transcript**:
[Music] They've sat with us at nearly every
table, a pair that's partnered most of the meals ever cooked in western
kitchens. A Yin and Yang, darkness and light. The importance of salt is crystal
clear. Life wouldn't exist without it and if it
did it would taste gross and weird. But out of all the herbs and spices on the
culinary roster how did this ground up gray stuff become
the go-to spice of life. Seriously, why not salt and turmeric or
salt and mustard, salt and cumin, salt and nutmeg, salt and coriander, salt and paprika, salt and cinnamon, salt and allspice, salt and cloves. [Music] Salt, or specifically sodium
chloride. It's the only rock that we eat, the
unlikely joining of a poisonous gas and an explosive-metal and when paired with
water it provides both the incubator and ingredients for life. We use sodium and chloride ions to keep
our cells inflated, to regulate blood pressure and convey electrical nerve
impulses throughout our body. To maintain this we need to consume about six grams
of sodium chloride every day. So salt's culinary and cultural value is no
surprise its history could fill a book, and it has.
A great book by the way. Have you guys read the book Salt: A World History Early hunter-gatherer societies got
all the salt needed from their animal diet To this day the Masai people of East
Africa get theirs from drinking the blood of their livestock. But as human
society is shifted to growing and eating plants, salt became something you either
found or traded for. The earliest sites of salt harvesting date to at least
6,000 BC in China and Europe There's salt in most of the blue wet
stuff covering earth once you boil away or evaporate all that pesky H2O but there's pure sodium chloride in
Earth's crust, if you can find it. Following animal
trails led us to natural salt licks and some of these became our first highways.
Several ancient salt harvesting cities still bear a pinch of history in their
name. Entire economies were built around salt. It was a commodity and currency
that you could eat. Roman warriors deemed worth their salt
where sometimes given a salary. The Roman custom of salting bitter
greens even gave us salad. Although that caesar dressing comes from Tijuana. Today salt is cheap enough to manufacture that many people are in
danger of eating too much. But before the Industrial Age it was scarce enough that
people fought wars over it. It even inspired at least one revolution. Before refrigeration, salting was one way
to keep food from spoiling. Since most harmful bacteria can't grow
in high salt conditions. But obviously salt also changes how we experience our
food. It makes things taste salty but it also accentuates other flavors. Sodium
chloride can chemically block bitter taste receptors and amplify those that
sense sweet, salty, and umami. Depending on when and how its applied to food it can change the very chemistry of how it's
cooked. Salt is probably the most important
ingredient on Earth. But then there's pepper. One spice to rule them all. If you thought salt was interesting,
pepper is is a thing. Black pepper comes from a flowering vine
native to Southeast Asia. It gets its heat from a chemical called
piperine. Rather than capsaicin like those confusingly named fruits of the
chili pepper family. It's been a common ingredient in Indian
cooking for at least four thousand years. But small amounts of black pepper made
their way to Greece, Rome, and even ancient Egypt, where peppercorns were
apparently valuable enough to stuff up the mummified nose of Ramses the second. Pepper became a key commodity in the
spice trade stretching between Asia and Europe, where its main use like other
pungent spices was to mask the flavor of meat that was, shall we say, past its
prime. The extreme distances involved in
trading pepper across the known world translated into extreme prices. To
inflate them further Arab traders invented a myth that pepper gardens were
guarded by serpents which had to be chased away with fire before a harvest. 
Who wouldn't want to put magic snake powder on their food. Throughout the
Middle Ages it was common to see many spices used in the food of the wealthy,
but the enduring popularity of black pepper may owe itself to one picky eater. Its said that Louis XIV
demanded his food lightly seasoned, preferring only salt and pepper be added.
The French cuisine developed then was the basis for much of what we eat today, and now pepper is the spice and I'm sick
of it. Too long we've been forced to look at the world of spice in black and white!
Held prisoner by pepper, unable to gaze upon the full rainbow of flavors and I
say no more! Join me, brothers and sisters, stand
together. We say yes to salt. But let us say anything but pepper! Stay spicy, and curious

You may have heard a lot about how dogs have an incredibly keen sense of smell, and it’s true. An average dog’s nose is anywhere between ten thousand to one hundred thousand times more sensitive that yours. So how can dogs with their super sense of smell be so interested in their K9 compatriot’s rear ends? Well folks, the answer is more complex and interesting thank you think. When a dog smells another dog’s butt, it’s actually collecting a bunch of information about the other dog – its diet, its gender, its emotional state and so on. Think of it kind of like speaking with chemicals. In fact, this butt-sniffing action is just one of many examples of chemical communication in the animal kingdom. But what chemicals are packed in a fido’s rear end and where do they come from? We talked to Dr. George Preti of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. Dr. Preti currently studies the complexity of human body odors and pheromones. But back in 1975, he was on the cutting edge of dog butts science. He and his team of researchers examined the anal secretions of dogs and wild coyotes. So on both sides of Sparky’s back door is a stinky, small pouch called an anal sac. This sac houses glands that excrete the chemicals dogs use to get to know each other. The apocrine gland is most responsible for that “dog smell”, but the sebaceous glands also play a part. Petri discovered the primary chemical compounds that produce a dog’s aroma are trimethylamine and a host of short chain acids. As you might expect, anal sac secretions have a very powerful, sharp odor as a result of the acids inside. But a dog’s genetics, diet, and the current state of their immune system can all influence this aroma through chemical changes in the secretions. You’d think the smell of dog poop would overpower Rover’s sensitive snout. But dogs have a second olfactory system in their hyper-sensitive nose called the Jacobson’s organ. The organ is designed specifically for chemical  communication. It has its own set of nerves that lead directly to the brain, so there’s absolutely no interference from other odors. The same organ is used when a dog sniffs a fire hydrant, or anywhere else there happens to be dog pee. So, there you have it folks. Your precious pet isn’t obsessed with other dog’s butts per say. They’re just getting to know each other in a professional aromatic way. Hey speaking of aroma, you should check out this video on why bacon smells so good, because bacon is to people, as butts are to dogs. Thanks for watching folks, don’t forget to subscribe and we’ll see you again soon.

The same organ is used when a dog sniffs a fire hydrant, or anywhere else there happens to be dog pee. So, there you have it folks. Your precious pet isn’t obsessed with other dog’s butts per say. They’re just getting to know each other in a professional aromatic way. Hey speaking of aroma, you should check out this video on why bacon smells so good, because bacon is to people, as butts are to dogs. Thanks for watching folks, don’t forget to subscribe and we’ll see you again soon.

**Transcript**:
I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want." (Laughter) "I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want." This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go
to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how
to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired
by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community." I said no because I knew
where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,
a little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the music
that I was hearing every day, and that is the music
that girls hear every day when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time in our community?" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book." It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me
their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I'll begin today by sharing a poem written by my friend from Malawi, Eileen Piri. Eileen is only 13 years old, but when we were going through
the collection of poetry that we wrote, I found her poem so interesting, so motivating. So I'll read it to you. She entitled her poem
"I'll Marry When I Want." (Laughter) "I'll marry when I want. My mother can't force me to marry. My father cannot force me to marry. My uncle, my aunt, my brother or sister, cannot force me to marry. No one in the world can force me to marry. I'll marry when I want. Even if you beat me, even if you chase me away, even if you do anything bad to me, I'll marry when I want. I'll marry when I want, but not before I am well educated, and not before I am all grown up. I'll marry when I want." This poem might seem odd, written by a 13-year-old girl, but where I and Eileen come from, this poem, which I have just read to you, is a warrior's cry. I am from Malawi. Malawi is one of the poorest countries, very poor, where gender equality is questionable. Growing up in that country, I couldn't make my own choices in life. I couldn't even explore personal opportunities in life. I will tell you a story of two different girls, two beautiful girls. These girls grew up under the same roof. They were eating the same food. Sometimes, they would share clothes, and even shoes. But their lives ended up differently, in two different paths. The other girl is my little sister. My little sister was only 11 years old when she got pregnant. It's a hurtful thing. Not only did it hurt her, even me. I was going through a hard time as well. As it is in my culture, once you reach puberty stage, you are supposed to go
to initiation camps. In these initiation camps, you are taught how
to sexually please a man. There is this special day, which they call "Very Special Day" where a man who is hired
by the community comes to the camp and sleeps with the little girls. Imagine the trauma that these young girls go through every day. Most girls end up pregnant. They even contract HIV and AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. For my little sister,
she ended up being pregnant. Today, she's only 16 years old and she has three children. Her first marriage did not survive, nor did her second marriage. On the other side, there is this girl. She's amazing. (Laughter) (Applause) I call her amazing because she is. She's very fabulous. That girl is me. (Laughter) When I was 13 years old, I was told, you are grown up, you have now reached of age, you're supposed to go
to the initiation camp. I was like, "What? I'm not going to go
to the initiation camps." You know what the women said to me? "You are a stupid girl. Stubborn. You do not respect the traditions
of our society, of our community." I said no because I knew
where I was going. I knew what I wanted in life. I had a lot of dreams as a young girl. I wanted to get well educated, to find a decent job in the future. I was imagining myself as a lawyer, seated on that big chair. Those were the imaginations that were going through my mind every day. And I knew that one day, I would contribute something,
a little something to my community. But every day after refusing, women would tell me, "Look at you, you're all grown up.
Your little sister has a baby. What about you?" That was the music
that I was hearing every day, and that is the music
that girls hear every day when they don't do something
that the community needs them to do. When I compared the two stories
between me and my sister, I said, "Why can't I do something? Why can't I change something
that has happened for a long time in our community?" That was when I called other girls just like my sister, who have children, who have been in class but they have
forgotten how to read and write. I said, "Come on, we can 
remind each other how to read and write again, how to hold the pen,
how to read, to hold the book." It was a great time I had with them. Nor did I just learn a little about them, but they were able to tell me
their personal stories, what they were facing every day as young mothers. That was when I was like, 'Why can't we take all these things
that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed

that are happening to us and present them and tell our mothers,
our traditional leaders, that these are the wrong things?" It was a scary thing to do, because these traditional leaders, they are already accustomed to the things that have been there for ages. A hard thing to change, but a good thing to try. So we tried. It was very hard, but we pushed. And I'm here to say that in my community, it was the first community after girls pushed so hard to our traditional leader, and our leader stood up for us
and said no girl has to be married before the age of 18. (Applause) In my community, that was the first time a community, they had to call the bylaws, the first bylaw that protected girls in our community. We did not stop there. We forged ahead. We were determined to fight for girls
not just in my community, but even in other communities. When the child marriage bill
was being presented in February, we were there at the Parliament house. Every day, when the members
of Parliament were entering, we were telling them,
"Would you please support the bill?" And we don't have
much technology like here, but we have our small phones. So we said, "Why can't we get 
their numbers and text them?" So we did that. It was a good thing. (Applause) So when the bill passed,
we texted them back, "Thank you for supporting the bill." (Laughter) And when the bill was signed
by the president, making it into law, it was a plus. Now, in Malawi, 18 is the legal
marriage age, from 15 to 18. (Applause) It's a good thing to know
that the bill passed, but let me tell you this: There are countries where 18
is the legal marriage age, but don't we hear cries
of women and girls every day? Every day, girls' lives
are being wasted away. This is high time for leaders
to honor their commitment. In honoring this commitment, it means keeping girls' issues
at heart every time. We don't have to be subjected as second, but they have to know that women,
as we are in this room, we are not just women,
we are not just girls, we are extraordinary. We can do more. And another thing for Malawi, and not just Malawi but other countries: The laws which are there, you know how a law is not a law
until it is enforced? The law which has just recently passed and the laws that in other countries
have been there, they need to be publicized
at the local level, at the community level, where girls' issues are very striking. Girls face issues, difficult issues,
at the community level every day. So if these young girls know
that there are laws that protect them, they will be able to stand up
and defend themselves because they will know that
there is a law that protects them. And another thing I would say is that girls' voices and women's voices are beautiful, they are there, but we cannot do this alone. Male advocates, they have to jump in, to step in and work together. It's a collective work. What we need is what girls elsewhere need: good education, and above all,
not to marry whilst 11. And furthermore, I know that together, we can transform the legal, the cultural and political framework that denies girls of their rights. I am standing here today and declaring that we can
end child marriage in a generation. This is the moment where a girl and a girl,
and millions of girls worldwide, will be able to say, "I will marry when I want." (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As a wildfire rages through
the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest
flee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank
of a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens
to be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the
wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in,
and the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat
when it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals
to get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make
at each point, and the consequences each choice
leads to. For instance, there are five options
for who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately
get eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions
in the same number of moves. For the sake of time,
we'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays 
and the lion returns, there will be three lions
on the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion
stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion 
already on the left bank. If two wildebeest go,
the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft
will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting
on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest
to cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest
going back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest
on the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest
take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal
on the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending 
the lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either
a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest
on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the
wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion
to raft back and bring his fellow lions over
one by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed
to get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both
lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed
from the fire just in time and begin their new lives 
across the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their
unlikely alliance will last.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why can’t the first move be two wildebeest going across?

**Transcript**:
As a wildfire rages through
the grasslands, three lions and three wildebeest
flee for their lives. To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank
of a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens
to be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion
or wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the
wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in,
and the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat
when it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals
to get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make
at each point, and the consequences each choice
leads to. For instance, there are five options
for who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately
get eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions
in the same number of moves. For the sake of time,
we'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays 
and the lion returns, there will be three lions
on the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion
stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion 
already on the left bank. If two wildebeest go,
the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft
will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to
the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting
on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest
to cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest
going back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest
on the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest
take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal
on the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending 
the lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either
a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest
on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the
wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion
to raft back and bring his fellow lions over
one by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed
to get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both
lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed
from the fire just in time and begin their new lives 
across the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their
unlikely alliance will last.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: After the wildebeest rafts back (second crossing), which animal(s) now raft from the right side of the river to the left side (third crossing)?

**Transcript**:
This is a map of Yellowstone National Park. For the most part the park is in Wyoming, but it extends a bit into Montana and Idaho. This little 50 square miles section in Idaho is what concerns us. It's called the zone of death, because of a loophole that exists in the Constitution of the United States. If someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder. Yellowstone was established in 1872 before Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana joined the Union. It's federal land and always has been, but federal land across the U.S. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts. Except for Yellowstone. And this is where the loophole begins. Law professor Brian C. Kalt points out in his 2005 paper, "The Perfect Crime", that Yellowstone National Park was assigned fully to Wyoming's district court, even though small portions fall into Montana and Idaho. "Unlike every other district, the district of Wyoming includes land in other states." So Kalt asks the question: what happens if you're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile Idaho region of the park? The first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to Cheyenne, the hub of the district court of Wyoming, because the crime technically happened within Wyoming's jurisdiction. But Article 3 Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime. If you're a savvy murderer you'll invoke your right to a trial in Idaho. So they bring you back to Idaho no big deal. "In the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed." This is called the Vicinage Clause. That leaves you with a sort of venn diagram. You have the right to demand jury from that middle area, where the state in which you committed the crime, that's Idaho, overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime: the Wyoming district that has jurisdiction over Yellowstone National Park. And here's the problem: "nobody lives there. There's there's no way for them to give you a trial and so I argue they should have to let you go." This could also happen in the Montana portion of the park, except a few dozen people do live there, so a jury could theoretically be called. Kalt has proposed numerous solutions to Congress to fix the loophole, but they have yet to act. "All they have to do is redraw the district line so that the district of Wyoming is Wyoming, the district of Idaho is Idaho, and the district of Montana is Montana and if they do that this all goes away." So if you're planning a gathering of your adversaries, exes, and debtors, maybe try Yosemite.

**Transcript**:
This is a map of Yellowstone National Park. For the most part the park is in Wyoming, but it extends a bit into Montana and Idaho. This little 50 square miles section in Idaho is what concerns us. It's called the zone of death, because of a loophole that exists in the Constitution of the United States. If someone were to exploit that loophole they might be able to get away with murder. Yellowstone was established in 1872 before Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana joined the Union. It's federal land and always has been, but federal land across the U.S. is split up and divided into its corresponding state district courts. Except for Yellowstone. And this is where the loophole begins. Law professor Brian C. Kalt points out in his 2005 paper, "The Perfect Crime", that Yellowstone National Park was assigned fully to Wyoming's district court, even though small portions fall into Montana and Idaho. "Unlike every other district, the district of Wyoming includes land in other states." So Kalt asks the question: what happens if you're caught for a crime you committed in that 50 square mile Idaho region of the park? The first thing law enforcement would do is bring you to Cheyenne, the hub of the district court of Wyoming, because the crime technically happened within Wyoming's jurisdiction. But Article 3 Section 2 of the United States Constitution says that the trial should happen in the state where you committed the crime. If you're a savvy murderer you'll invoke your right to a trial in Idaho. So they bring you back to Idaho no big deal. "In the sixth amendment they said that they would require local juries and the language they use is that the jury has to be from the state and district where the crime was committed." This is called the Vicinage Clause. That leaves you with a sort of venn diagram. You have the right to demand jury from that middle area, where the state in which you committed the crime, that's Idaho, overlaps with the judicial jurisdiction where you committed the crime: the Wyoming district that has jurisdiction over Yellowstone National Park. And here's the problem: "nobody lives there. There's there's no way for them to give you a trial and so I argue they should have to let you go." This could also happen in the Montana portion of the park, except a few dozen people do live there, so a jury could theoretically be called. Kalt has proposed numerous solutions to Congress to fix the loophole, but they have yet to act. "All they have to do is redraw the district line so that the district of Wyoming is Wyoming, the district of Idaho is Idaho, and the district of Montana is Montana and if they do that this all goes away." So if you're planning a gathering of your adversaries, exes, and debtors, maybe try Yosemite.

**Transcript**:
Imagine waking up the morning of prom, or
your wedding day, or a big job interview… and sure enough, you look in the mirror to
find your forehead is covered in zits! It’s happened to lots of us. Acne, or acne vulgaris, is the most common
skin disease in humans. It affects about 80% of people at some point
in their lives. Most people get acne between the ages of 11
and 30, but sometimes older people continue to struggle with it, too. Acne happens when follicles and pores become
clogged with dead skin cells and oils. And … it sucks. But by studying how acne forms, doctors have
developed ways to prevent and treat it. It all starts with your skin: a complex organ
made up of two layers and lots of nerves, blood vessels, and glands. Your skin cells regenerate about once a month,
so you constantly have dead skin cells sloughing off, and new skin cells rising to the surface. This whole skin-replacement thing isn’t
much of a problem, on its own. But lots of these dead skin cells come out
through your pores. And pores make things more complicated. Skin pores are essentially just openings for
tiny hairs. Hair follicles, the root ends of the hairs,
are embedded in your skin and surrounded by clusters of sebaceous glands, special glands
that produce sebum. Sebum is that oily, waxy stuff that comes
out of your pores. It helps keep your skin waterproof and moisturized:
it keeps excess water out of your body, and it keeps water already inside you from getting
out through your skin. So, sebum is important. But things can go very wrong if your sebum
production gets out of whack. When your body doesn’t produce enough sebum,
your skin can dry out, making you more susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. But if your body produces too much sebum,
it can build up inside your pores, trap dead skin cells, and cause a blockage. Increased sebum production is one of the major
factors involved in the development of acne. Increased keratin production is another one. Keratin is a protein produced by your hair
follicles. It gives structure to each strand of hair,
as well as the top layer of your skin. But when the hair follicles produce too much
keratin, the extra protein binds together dead skin cells, so they can’t just shed
out of the pore like they normally would. You end up with a blockage that then traps
more dead skin cells, plus sebum. Once the pore is officially clogged, it becomes
a breeding ground for colonies of bacteria — especially Propionibacterium acnes. That’s a species of commensal bacteria,
which basically means it’s friendly. It naturally lives on your skin, and it’s
not harmful … most of the time. The commensal bacteria that make up your microbiome
probably even help prevent other, more harmful bacteria from colonizing on your skin. So having colonies of Propionibacterium acnes
living on you isn’t a bad thing. You want them there — as long as they stay
on the surface of your skin. When the bacteria find their way deep into
skin pores where they don’t belong, that’s when they can cause an infection. And infections often cause inflammation. When you get an infection, your immune system
responds by increasing blood flow to the area and sending extra immune cells and enzymes
to fight off the infection. Different combinations of symptoms cause different
kinds of acne, with names you’ve probably heard before:Blackheads, whiteheads, pimples,
pustules … technically, they all mean different things. The scientific term for a clogged pore is
a comedo, which actually used to mean a parasitic worm. People started using the term to refer to
a clogged pore because the stuff that comes out when you squeeze it looks kind of like
a worm. When the main symptom is just that the pore
is clogged, without much inflammation, that’s either a blackhead or a whitehead. Blackheads are what it’s called when the
comedo is open. The trapped sebum and dead skin cells become
oxidized, which turns the surface of the clogged material into a dark color, kind of like how
silver tarnishes. When the comedo closes, skin cells grow over
the top of the plug and stop this oxidation from happening, so the whitish color of the
sebum shows through. That’s called a whitehead. When there’s a comedo plus an infection
that causes inflammation, that’s a different kind of acne: pimples! The typical reddish bumpy kind are more specifically
called papules. If the inflammation gets really bad, sometimes
the bumps start leaking fluid or bacteria-filled pus. Those kind are categorized as pustules, and
they’re usually a much brighter red, or sometimes white from the oozing fluid. The most severe kind of acne is generally
called cystic acne. That’s when the infection takes root in
the deepest layers of the skin. Sometimes the infection causes more solid
bumps to form, called nodules. And sometimes the infection causes pus-filled
bumps, called cysts. So that’s how acne happens. But what causes it in the first place? What makes healthy pores become clogged, infected,
and sometimes ooze-y? Again, there are a few different factors involved. Genetics seem to be important, for one thing. So if your parents had acne, you’re more
likely to have it too. Hormones also have a huge influence on acne
— specifically, androgen hormones, like testosterone, which influence the development
of both the male and female reproductive systems. Which explains why acne is so much more of
a problem during puberty. Androgen hormones are linked to sebum production. So during puberty, when the hormones are highly
active, there’s an increase in sebum production. Increased stress has been thought to increase
hormone production, as well. So if you find yourself breaking out the day
before a big test, that’s probably why. When you’re stressed, you produce more hormones,
which then increases your sebum production. Since sebum is an oil, a lot of people say
that greasy foods will cause acne. Sometimes you’ll also hear that dairy makes
it worse, or even more specific foods, like chocolate. But the truth is, scientists aren’t really
sure how or whether diet and acne are connected. There have been lots of studies investigating
this, and some do suggest a possible link. But others don’t. We need more comprehensive, controlled trials
with plenty of subjects before we can come to any real conclusions. Doctors do acknowledge that there’s anecdotal
evidence, and they say that if changing your diet has helped with your acne, then it makes
sense for you to stick with it. There just isn’t enough evidence to support
the idea that diet has a role in acne in general. But we do know that exposure to other topical
oils, like some cosmetics or moisturizers, can cause acne by blocking your pores with
extra oils and trapping sebum. It’s easy to avoid the problem, though — just
look for products that say they’re non-comedogenic, which means that they shouldn’t clog your
pores. But the natural oil on your face isn’t really
a problem. You’ll often hear that you should wash your
face a lot to help prevent acne, but acne isn’t caused by dirt or by the natural oil
that’s already on the surface of your skin. And washing your face too much can actually
irritate your skin, making acne worse. To treat acne, the goal is to reduce the factors
that come together to cause breakouts. The one thing you shouldn’t do is pop a
zit. The big risk is that you’ll push the infection
out of the hair follicle and into the surrounding skin, instead of out to the surface. Plus, you’ll irritate the area, causing
more inflammation and making the acne take longer to heal. You might also spread bacteria to non-affected
pores. Instead, treatments try to lower sebum production,
stop dead cells from clumping together in the pore as much, prevent bacterial growth,
and lower inflammation. Treatments can range from mild to aggressive,
depending on how severe the symptoms are. For mild acne like blackheads and whiteheads,
you can usually use topical over-the-counter medications. One of the most effective is benzoyl peroxide,
a chemical compound that’s really good at killing bacteria. It decomposes into super reactive forms of
oxygen, which bind to and destroy the molecules the bacteria need to survive. Another common treatment is salicylic acid,
which doesn’t kill the bacteria, but stops them from replicating. It can also break down skin cells and keratin
to help unclog the pores Inflammatory acne, like papular pimples or
cystic acne, sometimes needs stronger treatment to reduce the inflammation. That usually means prescription meds. ###Antibiotics — the kind that are also
used to treat other bacterial infections, from strep throat to urinary tract infections
— can be used to treat acne. They stop bacterial growth and reduce inflammation. Another kind of treatment involves retinoids,
which are compounds related to vitamin A. Retinoids work by binding to skin cell receptors
to remove dead skin cells and encourage healthy skin cell growth. So retinoids work really well to unclog pores
full of dead skin cells. They’re anti-inflammatory, too. In severe cystic acne cases, stronger retinoids
actually work at the deeper layers of skin to reduce the size of the oil glands so they
produce less sebum. And since hormones are a big factor in sebum
production, using birth control or corticosteroids can regulate female hormones and reduce the
amount of androgen hormones being produced. Fewer androgen receptors at work means less
sebum production, which means less acne. Sometimes, severe, cystic acne will leave
scarring, but there are ways to reduce it. These procedures don’t necessarily treat
or prevent the acne itself, but they can reduce the bumps and scars left over from bad breakouts. Dermabrasion uses a gentle sanding tool to
wear down layers of the skin that have scarred over from cystic acne, but it only works for
people with lighter skin. This procedure has mostly been replaced by
laser resurfacing, which uses laser pulses to remove skin layer by layer until the scar
has smoothed out. Then there are chemical peels, which use compounds
like salicylic acid or retinoic acid to perform what’s basically a controlled injury to
the top layer of skin, killing the top layer of cells. The dead skin cells peel off, revealing healthy
skin cells underneath. Luckily, most people grow out of the acne-ridden
years of puberty, though some people will continue to have acne well into their 40s
and 50s. But even though a bad breakout might make
you self-conscious, it’s normal, it’s treatable, and it’s not life-threatening. So take care of your skin, talk to your doctor
about prescription treatments if you want them, and trust that your acne will probably
get better with age. And then you get to look forward to wrinkles! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
Imagine waking up the morning of prom, or
your wedding day, or a big job interview… and sure enough, you look in the mirror to
find your forehead is covered in zits! It’s happened to lots of us. Acne, or acne vulgaris, is the most common
skin disease in humans. It affects about 80% of people at some point
in their lives. Most people get acne between the ages of 11
and 30, but sometimes older people continue to struggle with it, too. Acne happens when follicles and pores become
clogged with dead skin cells and oils. And … it sucks. But by studying how acne forms, doctors have
developed ways to prevent and treat it. It all starts with your skin: a complex organ
made up of two layers and lots of nerves, blood vessels, and glands. Your skin cells regenerate about once a month,
so you constantly have dead skin cells sloughing off, and new skin cells rising to the surface. This whole skin-replacement thing isn’t
much of a problem, on its own. But lots of these dead skin cells come out
through your pores. And pores make things more complicated. Skin pores are essentially just openings for
tiny hairs. Hair follicles, the root ends of the hairs,
are embedded in your skin and surrounded by clusters of sebaceous glands, special glands
that produce sebum. Sebum is that oily, waxy stuff that comes
out of your pores. It helps keep your skin waterproof and moisturized:
it keeps excess water out of your body, and it keeps water already inside you from getting
out through your skin. So, sebum is important. But things can go very wrong if your sebum
production gets out of whack. When your body doesn’t produce enough sebum,
your skin can dry out, making you more susceptible to bacterial or fungal infections. But if your body produces too much sebum,
it can build up inside your pores, trap dead skin cells, and cause a blockage. Increased sebum production is one of the major
factors involved in the development of acne. Increased keratin production is another one. Keratin is a protein produced by your hair
follicles. It gives structure to each strand of hair,
as well as the top layer of your skin. But when the hair follicles produce too much
keratin, the extra protein binds together dead skin cells, so they can’t just shed
out of the pore like they normally would. You end up with a blockage that then traps
more dead skin cells, plus sebum. Once the pore is officially clogged, it becomes
a breeding ground for colonies of bacteria — especially Propionibacterium acnes. That’s a species of commensal bacteria,
which basically means it’s friendly. It naturally lives on your skin, and it’s
not harmful … most of the time. The commensal bacteria that make up your microbiome
probably even help prevent other, more harmful bacteria from colonizing on your skin. So having colonies of Propionibacterium acnes
living on you isn’t a bad thing. You want them there — as long as they stay
on the surface of your skin. When the bacteria find their way deep into
skin pores where they don’t belong, that’s when they can cause an infection. And infections often cause inflammation. When you get an infection, your immune system
responds by increasing blood flow to the area and sending extra immune cells and enzymes
to fight off the infection. Different combinations of symptoms cause different
kinds of acne, with names you’ve probably heard before:Blackheads, whiteheads, pimples,
pustules … technically, they all mean different things. The scientific term for a clogged pore is
a comedo, which actually used to mean a parasitic worm. People started using the term to refer to
a clogged pore because the stuff that comes out when you squeeze it looks kind of like
a worm. When the main symptom is just that the pore
is clogged, without much inflammation, that’s either a blackhead or a whitehead. Blackheads are what it’s called when the
comedo is open. The trapped sebum and dead skin cells become
oxidized, which turns the surface of the clogged material into a dark color, kind of like how
silver tarnishes. When the comedo closes, skin cells grow over
the top of the plug and stop this oxidation from happening, so the whitish color of the
sebum shows through. That’s called a whitehead. When there’s a comedo plus an infection
that causes inflammation, that’s a different kind of acne: pimples! The typical reddish bumpy kind are more specifically
called papules. If the inflammation gets really bad, sometimes
the bumps start leaking fluid or bacteria-filled pus. Those kind are categorized as pustules, and
they’re usually a much brighter red, or sometimes white from the oozing fluid. The most severe kind of acne is generally
called cystic acne. That’s when the infection takes root in
the deepest layers of the skin. Sometimes the infection causes more solid
bumps to form, called nodules. And sometimes the infection causes pus-filled
bumps, called cysts. So that’s how acne happens. But what causes it in the first place? What makes healthy pores become clogged, infected,
and sometimes ooze-y? Again, there are a few different factors involved. Genetics seem to be important, for one thing. So if your parents had acne, you’re more
likely to have it too. Hormones also have a huge influence on acne
— specifically, androgen hormones, like testosterone, which influence the development
of both the male and female reproductive systems. Which explains why acne is so much more of
a problem during puberty. Androgen hormones are linked to sebum production. So during puberty, when the hormones are highly
active, there’s an increase in sebum production. Increased stress has been thought to increase
hormone production, as well. So if you find yourself breaking out the day
before a big test, that’s probably why. When you’re stressed, you produce more hormones,
which then increases your sebum production. Since sebum is an oil, a lot of people say
that greasy foods will cause acne. Sometimes you’ll also hear that dairy makes
it worse, or even more specific foods, like chocolate. But the truth is, scientists aren’t really
sure how or whether diet and acne are connected. There have been lots of studies investigating
this, and some do suggest a possible link. But others don’t. We need more comprehensive, controlled trials
with plenty of subjects before we can come to any real conclusions. Doctors do acknowledge that there’s anecdotal
evidence, and they say that if changing your diet has helped with your acne, then it makes
sense for you to stick with it. There just isn’t enough evidence to support
the idea that diet has a role in acne in general. But we do know that exposure to other topical
oils, like some cosmetics or moisturizers, can cause acne by blocking your pores with
extra oils and trapping sebum. It’s easy to avoid the problem, though — just
look for products that say they’re non-comedogenic, which means that they shouldn’t clog your
pores. But the natural oil on your face isn’t really
a problem. You’ll often hear that you should wash your
face a lot to help prevent acne, but acne isn’t caused by dirt or by the natural oil
that’s already on the surface of your skin. And washing your face too much can actually
irritate your skin, making acne worse. To treat acne, the goal is to reduce the factors
that come together to cause breakouts. The one thing you shouldn’t do is pop a
zit. The big risk is that you’ll push the infection
out of the hair follicle and into the surrounding skin, instead of out to the surface. Plus, you’ll irritate the area, causing
more inflammation and making the acne take longer to heal. You might also spread bacteria to non-affected
pores. Instead, treatments try to lower sebum production,
stop dead cells from clumping together in the pore as much, prevent bacterial growth,
and lower inflammation. Treatments can range from mild to aggressive,
depending on how severe the symptoms are. For mild acne like blackheads and whiteheads,
you can usually use topical over-the-counter medications. One of the most effective is benzoyl peroxide,
a chemical compound that’s really good at killing bacteria. It decomposes into super reactive forms of
oxygen, which bind to and destroy the molecules the bacteria need to survive. Another common treatment is salicylic acid,
which doesn’t kill the bacteria, but stops them from replicating. It can also break down skin cells and keratin
to help unclog the pores Inflammatory acne, like papular pimples or
cystic acne, sometimes needs stronger treatment to reduce the inflammation. That usually means prescription meds. ###Antibiotics — the kind that are also
used to treat other bacterial infections, from strep throat to urinary tract infections
— can be used to treat acne. They stop bacterial growth and reduce inflammation. Another kind of treatment involves retinoids,
which are compounds related to vitamin A. Retinoids work by binding to skin cell receptors
to remove dead skin cells and encourage healthy skin cell growth. So retinoids work really well to unclog pores
full of dead skin cells. They’re anti-inflammatory, too. In severe cystic acne cases, stronger retinoids
actually work at the deeper layers of skin to reduce the size of the oil glands so they
produce less sebum. And since hormones are a big factor in sebum
production, using birth control or corticosteroids can regulate female hormones and reduce the
amount of androgen hormones being produced. Fewer androgen receptors at work means less
sebum production, which means less acne. Sometimes, severe, cystic acne will leave
scarring, but there are ways to reduce it. These procedures don’t necessarily treat
or prevent the acne itself, but they can reduce the bumps and scars left over from bad breakouts. Dermabrasion uses a gentle sanding tool to
wear down layers of the skin that have scarred over from cystic acne, but it only works for
people with lighter skin. This procedure has mostly been replaced by
laser resurfacing, which uses laser pulses to remove skin layer by layer until the scar
has smoothed out. Then there are chemical peels, which use compounds
like salicylic acid or retinoic acid to perform what’s basically a controlled injury to
the top layer of skin, killing the top layer of cells. The dead skin cells peel off, revealing healthy
skin cells underneath. Luckily, most people grow out of the acne-ridden
years of puberty, though some people will continue to have acne well into their 40s
and 50s. But even though a bad breakout might make
you self-conscious, it’s normal, it’s treatable, and it’s not life-threatening. So take care of your skin, talk to your doctor
about prescription treatments if you want them, and trust that your acne will probably
get better with age. And then you get to look forward to wrinkles! Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

**Transcript**:
Few individuals have influenced the world
and many of today's thinkers like Plato. One 20th century philosopher 
even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy
as a series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's 
greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns
of a few of his best and worst ideas. Plato argued that beyond
our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things
and concepts we see around us. They serve as a sort of instruction
manual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms
is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect
copies of ideal Forms. Plato argued that philosophers
should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate
our misleading reality. While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world
as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's
most vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands
of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we trust
our senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason. It alone provides us with at least
the potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind
amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds. "Featherless bipeds" 
was his official designation. Diogenes the Cynic,
annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class
with a plucked chicken, announcing, "Behold. Plato's man." But back to a few good ideas. Plato is one of the earliest 
political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one 
of the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler
was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered
the craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft 
of contemplating the Forms. In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia
where justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious
balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were
equally able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent
with women, elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's
womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body
and cause illness. This bad idea, also espoused by other
contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds
of years in European medicine. Furthermore, he thought that society
should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince
everyone to follow this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, 
silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers have gone on
to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration
for the dictators that used them. Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one 
of the greatest philosophers in history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who
came after him a place to start. Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas
through writing and experience, and have accepted some
while rejecting others. We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations
of the modern world.

**Transcript**:
Few individuals have influenced the world
and many of today's thinkers like Plato. One 20th century philosopher 
even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy
as a series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's 
greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of philosophy
wasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't 
exactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns
of a few of his best and worst ideas. Plato argued that beyond
our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things
and concepts we see around us. They serve as a sort of instruction
manual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms
is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect
copies of ideal Forms. Plato argued that philosophers
should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate
our misleading reality. While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world
as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's
most vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands
of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we trust
our senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason. It alone provides us with at least
the potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason didn't always pan out
for Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind
amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds. "Featherless bipeds" 
was his official designation. Diogenes the Cynic,
annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class
with a plucked chicken, announcing, "Behold. Plato's man." But back to a few good ideas. Plato is one of the earliest 
political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one 
of the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler
was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered
the craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft 
of contemplating the Forms. In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia
where justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious
balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were
equally able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent
with women, elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's
womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body
and cause illness. This bad idea, also espoused by other
contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds
of years in European medicine. Furthermore, he thought that society
should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince
everyone to follow this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, 
silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers have gone on
to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century
propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration
for the dictators that used them. Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one 
of the greatest philosophers in history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who
came after him a place to start. Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas
through writing and experience, and have accepted some
while rejecting others. We are continuing to refine,
amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations
of the modern world.

**Transcript**:
Light, bright, and cheerful. It's some of the most familiar
of all early 18th century music. It's been featured in uncounted films
and television commercials, but what is it 
and why does it sound that way? This is the opening of "Spring"
from "The Four Seasons," by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. "The Four Seasons" are famous in part
because they are a delight to the ear. However, even more notable is the fact that 
they have stories to tell. At the time of their publication
in Amsterdam in 1725, they were accompanied by poems describing exactly what feature
of that season Vivaldi intended to capture 
in musical terms. In providing specific plot content
for instrumental music, Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time. If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music, one would find the poetic scenes synchronizing nicely 
with the musical imagery. We are told that the birds welcome
spring with happy song, and here they are doing exactly that. Soon, however, 
a thunderstorm breaks out. Not only is there musical thunder
and lightning, there are also more birds, wet, frightened, and unhappy. In "Summer," the turtle dove sings 
her name "tortorella" in Italian, before a hail storm flattens the fields. "Autumn" brings eager hunters dashing
out in pursuit of their prey. The "Winter" concerto begins with teeth
chattering in the cold before one takes refuge by
a crackling fire. Then it's back out into the storm where there'll be slips 
and falls on the ice. In these first weeks of winter,
the old year is coming to a close, and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration
of the seasons. Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental
program music, as it was known, become popular. By then, larger, more varied ensembles
were the rule with woodwinds, brass, and percussion
to help tell the tale. But Vivaldi pulled it off with just
one violin, strings, and a harpsichord. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested
in complicated fugues. He preferred to offer readily
accessible entertainment to his listeners with melodies that pop back up later
in a piece to remind us of where we've been. So the first movement of the "Spring"
concerto begins with a theme for spring and ends with it, too, slightly varied
from when it was last heard. It was an inspired way 
to attract listeners, and Vivaldi, considered one of the most electrifying 
violinists of the early 18th century, understood the value 
of attracting audiences. Such concerts might feature himself
as the star violinist. Others presented the young musicians
of the Pietà, a Venetian girls' school
where Vivaldi was Director of Music. Most of the students were orphans. Music training was intended not only
as social skills suitable for young ladies but also as potential careers for those who might fail
to make good marriages. Even in the composer's own time, Vivaldi's music served 
as diversion for all, not just for the wealthy aristocrats. 300 years later, it's an approach
that still works, and Vivaldi's music still sounds
like trotting horses on the move.

**Transcript**:
Light, bright, and cheerful. It's some of the most familiar
of all early 18th century music. It's been featured in uncounted films
and television commercials, but what is it 
and why does it sound that way? This is the opening of "Spring"
from "The Four Seasons," by Italian composer Antonio Vivaldi. "The Four Seasons" are famous in part
because they are a delight to the ear. However, even more notable is the fact that 
they have stories to tell. At the time of their publication
in Amsterdam in 1725, they were accompanied by poems describing exactly what feature
of that season Vivaldi intended to capture 
in musical terms. In providing specific plot content
for instrumental music, Vivaldi was generations ahead of his time. If one were to read the poems
simultaneously to hearing the music, one would find the poetic scenes synchronizing nicely 
with the musical imagery. We are told that the birds welcome
spring with happy song, and here they are doing exactly that. Soon, however, 
a thunderstorm breaks out. Not only is there musical thunder
and lightning, there are also more birds, wet, frightened, and unhappy. In "Summer," the turtle dove sings 
her name "tortorella" in Italian, before a hail storm flattens the fields. "Autumn" brings eager hunters dashing
out in pursuit of their prey. The "Winter" concerto begins with teeth
chattering in the cold before one takes refuge by
a crackling fire. Then it's back out into the storm where there'll be slips 
and falls on the ice. In these first weeks of winter,
the old year is coming to a close, and so does Vivaldi's musical exploration
of the seasons. Not until the early 19th century would such expressive instrumental
program music, as it was known, become popular. By then, larger, more varied ensembles
were the rule with woodwinds, brass, and percussion
to help tell the tale. But Vivaldi pulled it off with just
one violin, strings, and a harpsichord. Unlike his contemporary Bach, Vivaldi wasn't much interested
in complicated fugues. He preferred to offer readily
accessible entertainment to his listeners with melodies that pop back up later
in a piece to remind us of where we've been. So the first movement of the "Spring"
concerto begins with a theme for spring and ends with it, too, slightly varied
from when it was last heard. It was an inspired way 
to attract listeners, and Vivaldi, considered one of the most electrifying 
violinists of the early 18th century, understood the value 
of attracting audiences. Such concerts might feature himself
as the star violinist. Others presented the young musicians
of the Pietà, a Venetian girls' school
where Vivaldi was Director of Music. Most of the students were orphans. Music training was intended not only
as social skills suitable for young ladies but also as potential careers for those who might fail
to make good marriages. Even in the composer's own time, Vivaldi's music served 
as diversion for all, not just for the wealthy aristocrats. 300 years later, it's an approach
that still works, and Vivaldi's music still sounds
like trotting horses on the move.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1997, JK Rowling published Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone. But most of her audience didn’t actually read that book. They read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s stone. or Harry Potter A L'Ecole des Sorciers Harry Potter va Sang-e Jadu Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal [cool humming of "Hedwig's Theme" ] The bewitching Harry Potter books have reached readers in over 200 territories in over 60 languages. The authorized translations came from separate publishing houses with little oversight from the author. So translators were not only tasked with adapting the text from english into their target languages and cultures, but also making assumptions about Rowling’s intentions and translating the spirit of her approach. Their task was particularly challenging because the Harry Potter series is filled with invented words, alliteration, wordplay, and British cultural references. The main characters first names: Harry, Hermione, and Ron mostly stayed the same across languages, with small changes to accommodate different alphabets and phonetics. That’s easy enough for conventional names like Harry Potter. But many of the other proper names in the book carry loaded meanings — meanings that would be lost if it’s not translated. Take Severus Snape. The name invokes severity and sounds like “snake.” So the Italian translator made the jump and named him Severus Piton —which is basically python. In French, he’s Severus Rogue which means Severus "Arrogance". As you can tell, both solutions sacrificed Rowling’s alliteration. The name “Hogwarts” combines two English words, but because the name stayed the same in most languages, those connotations were lost for those readers. In an attempt to preserve Rowling’s approach to the school’s name, the French translator used “Poudlard.” "Pou du lard" means lice of bacon or fat. The Hungarian version went with “Roxfort” a mix of the British university Oxford and Roquefort—a well known blue cheese. The house names and founders, also experienced unique adaptations in some of the target languages. In Catalan the names became: Nícanor Griffindor, Sírpentin Slytherin, Mari Pau Ravenclaw, and Horténsia Hufflepuff. There’s a ton of word play that happens in the Harry Potter books as well. The famous Diagon Alley, a play on the word "diagonally" and the infamous Knockturn Alley from "nocturnally". This type of pun is a real puzzle for translators, and most dropped it in favor of literal translations. The Spanish translator was able to rhyme at least with “callejón diagon.” And translators had several approaches to  Quidditch, an invented game made from the invented words Quaffle, Bludger, and Snitch— the 3 types of balls used in the game. In Spanish, the words were not changed. The French translator kept the word Quidditch but changed the names of the balls. And others changed the game’s name altogether. In Dutch, quidditch is “Zwerkbal.” In Norwegian, it’s “Rumpeldunk." OWLS and NEWTS, standardized tests in the wizarding world, weren’t always able to retain their animal acronyms. But in Swedish their implied meanings remained while the wording was changed. OWLs became Grund Examen i Trollkonst or G.E.T meaning goat in Swedish. And NEWTs were changed to Fruktansvärt Utmattande Trollkarls Test or F.U.T.T. derived from "futtig" meaning measly or mean. The infamous anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle’s name was altered by many translators to achieve the same revelation of “I Am Lord Voldemort.” In Danish, Tom is named "Romeo G. Detlev Jr." and in French he is “Tom Elvis Jedusor” which was extra clever because "Jeu du sort" means “fate riddle.” Culturally, the Harry Potter series is unmistakably British but translating that for a global group of readers wasn’t easy. Some food items were changed to make them less foreign for the target country. Sherbet lemons, a popular candy item in Britain, became krembo, a chocolate covered sweet from Israel. Crisps became chips in the US and in the Arabic version, bacon became eggs. Sometimes a foreign setting undergoes translation too. For the Ukrainian translation, the atmosphere of an English boarding school was swapped out for an orphanage. In the books and films, Hagrid has a provincial west country accent. Hagrid: "No? Blimey Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?" "You're a wizard, Harry." For the Japanese translations, it was replicated by using Tōhoku dialect, which is a pastoral accent from northeastern Japan. Other translators chose to have Hagrid simply speak more informally, while others dropped his accent entirely. Despite translators’ best efforts to remain true to the text some things still were lost in translation. In the mainland Chinese editions of Harry Potter there were footnotes to explain puns and cultural references. The Spanish translator sometimes used italics to signal an invented word with no translation. But in the end, it doesn’t matter if you’re reading Harry Potter and Philosopher’s Stone or the many translations of it. One thing that always seems to translate is the love fans around the world share for tales of "The Boy Who Lived."
