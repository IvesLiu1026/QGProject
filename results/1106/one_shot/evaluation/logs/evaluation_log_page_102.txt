Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We talk about inventions and innovation as though the best things out there are the Internet, iPads, or smart phones. Or perhaps more simply, trains, planes, and automobiles. Which one is most important, the best, or the greatest? Which one has had the most impact on society? Today the debate would probably be in favor of computer technology, but is it? Well, some would say, "Nope, not really, it's farming." Where would we be if we didn't have it? Give up? We would still be hunting and gathering with little time to invent anything, let alone the Internet. That's right, farming is the seed of civilization. Not quite literally, but without early man's discovery of using seeds to grow grain, we wouldn't have much of anything we have today. Growing your own food changed everything. Sure, hunting and gathering worked just fine for tens of thousands of years, but you couldn't do much else - no time. But when hunters and gatherers started planting seeds, they began to farm. With farming came animals, and with animals came settling down and staying in one location. So, how does this have anything to do with invention and innovation? Everything. Anyone who's ever farmed, even if it's planting a half dozen tomato plants in your backyard, knows that you usually harvest way more than you could possibly eat, a surplus. Farming yielded plenty of food, with enough to store, trade, and eat. In other words, not everyone needed to be farmers. Therefore, this allowed other people, non-farmers, to do other things such as make tools, craft pottery, and build homes. Farming and food surpluses led to the division of labor. This is still thousands of years ago, so life wasn't easy. But with so many people contributing to the community, small villages began to develop. As the population of villages expanded, so did the needs of the people. Things got complicated. But, civilization is just that - advanced, complex societies. And without farming, they would not exist. Villages increased in size, eventually becoming the first cities. Cities are just one of the basic features of a civilization, the others include central government, system of writing, organized religion, art and architecture, urban planning of roads, bridges, and public works, social classes, and different jobs. Developing expertise in various types of occupations allowed for innovative ways of doing things, producing new products, or making advancements in technology. As civilizations became more complex, new ways of doing things were needed. Some were out of necessity. Others because people had ideas. The sharing of ideas and technology led to the growth of things we readily use today, like the Internet. So without farming, we'd still be hunting and gathering. No video, no computers, and certainly no world wide web.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not ask which option is NOT a basic feature of civilization, it does list the basic features of civilization, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in the ground truth MCQ, "Villages", is actually an incorrect option in Question 5, as villages are not a basic feature of civilization but rather a precursor to cities, which are a basic feature of civilization.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. But among the given options, Question 5 is the closest match.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of the Boston Tea Party, something about a bunch of angry colonists dressed as Native Americans throwing chests of tea into the water. But the story is far more complicated, filled with imperial intrigue, corporate crisis, smuggling, and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution. The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's is that it was really, really popular. In England, each man, woman, and child consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year. And, since the English colonized America, Americans were crazy about tea too. By the 1760's, they were drinking over a million pounds of tea every year. So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes on tea in America, people were not happy, mostly because they had no say in tax decisions made in London. Remember that famous phrase, "No taxation without representation"? The American colonists had long believed that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature in which they lacked representation. In fact, rather than paying the taxes, they simply dodged the tax collectors. Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long and British enforcement was lax, about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking was smuggled in, usually from Holland. But the British insisted that Parliament did have the authority to tax the colonists, especially after Britain went deeply into debt fighting the French in the Seven Years' War. To close the budget gap, London looked to Americans, and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports, including the American's beloved tea. America's response: no thanks! They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain, and instead, brewed their own. After a new bunch of British customs commissioners cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement, things got so heated that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston, killing several people, in what was soon called the Boston Massacre. Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act, Parliament cooked up a new strategy. Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea directly through hand-picked consignees in America. This would lower the price to consumers, making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety while retaining some of the taxes. But the colonists saw through the British ploy and cried, "Monopoly!" Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773. About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded into the Old South Meeting House, waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea that have arrived down the harbor will be unloaded for sale. When the captain of one of those ships reported that he could not leave with his cargo on board, Sam Adams rose to shout, "This meeting can do no more to save the country!" Cries of "Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!" rang out from the crowd, and about 50 men, some apparently dressed as Native Americans, marched down to Griffin's Wharf, stormed aboard three ships, and threw 340 tea chests overboard. An infuriated British government responsded with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774, which, among other things, closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated the East India Company for the tea. That never happened. Representatives of the colonies gathered at Philadelphia to consider how best to respond to continued British oppression. This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea, pledged to support a continued boycott, and went home in late October 1774 even more united in their determination to protect their rights and liberties. The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction that led with little pause to the Declaration of Independence and a bloody rebellion, after which the new nation was free to drink its tea, more or less, in peace.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since the options in Question 5 do not match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an explanation for my choice. The ground truth MCQ asks about the reason for Parliament imposing new taxes on the American colonists after the mid-1700s. The correct answer is related to the British government's debt after the Seven Years' War.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the closest because it mentions the 1773 Tea Act, which is related to the British government's strategy to address the debt and impose taxes on the American colonists. However, the options in Question 5 do not directly address the reason for imposing taxes.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to select one, I would choose Question 5, keeping in mind that it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although Question 5 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the design of the 1773 Tea Act, while Question 5 asks about the main provision of the 1773 Tea Act. Both questions are related to the purpose and effect of the 1773 Tea Act.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as they do not offer the same options (A. Help the East India Company sell surplus tea, B. Lure the American colonists into buying taxed tea, C. Repeal all taxes on the colonists, including the one on imported tea, D. Both A and B, E. Both A and C). If the generated MCQs had the same options, it would be easier to identify a perfect match.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 5.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of the Boston Tea Party, something about a bunch of angry colonists dressed as Native Americans throwing chests of tea into the water. But the story is far more complicated, filled with imperial intrigue, corporate crisis, smuggling, and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution. The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's is that it was really, really popular. In England, each man, woman, and child consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year. And, since the English colonized America, Americans were crazy about tea too. By the 1760's, they were drinking over a million pounds of tea every year. So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes on tea in America, people were not happy, mostly because they had no say in tax decisions made in London. Remember that famous phrase, "No taxation without representation"? The American colonists had long believed that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature in which they lacked representation. In fact, rather than paying the taxes, they simply dodged the tax collectors. Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long and British enforcement was lax, about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking was smuggled in, usually from Holland. But the British insisted that Parliament did have the authority to tax the colonists, especially after Britain went deeply into debt fighting the French in the Seven Years' War. To close the budget gap, London looked to Americans, and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports, including the American's beloved tea. America's response: no thanks! They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain, and instead, brewed their own. After a new bunch of British customs commissioners cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement, things got so heated that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston, killing several people, in what was soon called the Boston Massacre. Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act, Parliament cooked up a new strategy. Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea directly through hand-picked consignees in America. This would lower the price to consumers, making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety while retaining some of the taxes. But the colonists saw through the British ploy and cried, "Monopoly!" Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773. About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded into the Old South Meeting House, waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea that have arrived down the harbor will be unloaded for sale. When the captain of one of those ships reported that he could not leave with his cargo on board, Sam Adams rose to shout, "This meeting can do no more to save the country!" Cries of "Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!" rang out from the crowd, and about 50 men, some apparently dressed as Native Americans, marched down to Griffin's Wharf, stormed aboard three ships, and threw 340 tea chests overboard. An infuriated British government responsded with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774, which, among other things, closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated the East India Company for the tea. That never happened. Representatives of the colonies gathered at Philadelphia to consider how best to respond to continued British oppression. This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea, pledged to support a continued boycott, and went home in late October 1774 even more united in their determination to protect their rights and liberties. The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction that led with little pause to the Declaration of Independence and a bloody rebellion, after which the new nation was free to drink its tea, more or less, in peace.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Deep in the jungles of Vietnam, soldiers from both sides battled heat exhaustion and each other for nearly 20 long years. But the key to Communist victory wasn't weapons or stamina, it was a dirt road. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, started as a simple network of dirt roads and blossomed into the centerpiece of the winning North Vietnamese strategy during the Vietnam War, supplying weapons, troops, and psychological support to the South. The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and river crossings that threaded west out of North Vietnam and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range between Vietnam and Laos. The journey to the South originally took six months. But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail. Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one week. Here is how it happened. In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. The first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction. Initially, most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam. They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf. They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the body. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats. Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out. Fear, boredom, and homesickness were the dominant emotions. And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers. The first troops down the trail did not engage in much fighting. And after an exhausting six month trip, arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song. By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck. Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground. As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S. bombing. They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft. Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks. Their catch cries were, "Everything for our Southern brothers!" and, "We will not worry about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through." Some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads. Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining roads. The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny. The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's success. North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin. Americans recognized its achievement, calling the trail, "One of the great achievements in military engineering of the 20th century." The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the countries through which the Ho Chi Minh Trail passed. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 mentions the original purpose of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which is related to its route and significance.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8, which asks about the significance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the Vietnam War. This question is not directly related to the countries through which the trail passed, but it does ask about the trail's importance, which is indirectly related to its route and the countries it traversed.

That being said, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 

 Question 8 (with a note that it's not a good match)

The journey to the South originally took six months. But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail. Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one week. Here is how it happened. In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. The first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction. Initially, most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam. They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf. They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the body. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats. Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out. Fear, boredom, and homesickness were the dominant emotions. And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers. The first troops down the trail did not engage in much fighting. And after an exhausting six month trip, arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song. By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck. Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground. As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S. bombing. They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft. Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks. Their catch cries were, "Everything for our Southern brothers!" and, "We will not worry about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through." Some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads. Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining roads. The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny. The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's success. North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin. Americans recognized its achievement, calling the trail, "One of the great achievements in military engineering of the 20th century." The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What was the significance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail in the Vietnam War?**

Although the question itself does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, one of its options (B. It was a key factor in the Communist victory) is related to the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ. Moreover, Question 8 assesses the significance of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer examination reveals that **none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ**. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the United States government's statement regarding the Ho Chi Minh Trail, whereas the generated MCQs do not address this aspect.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would select **Question 8**. Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize that the generated MCQs do not accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Great weather we're having! Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right? Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when someone says, "Great weather we're having," it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone says, "Great weather we're having," he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes. When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the second example: "Awesome job!" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So when the passenger says, "Awesome job!" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. "You're a talented athlete," said to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant. That is verbal irony. You have said the opposite of what you mean. Additionally, since you have the intention of mocking this poor person, you have not only been verbally ironic, but sarcastic as well. Beware, though. While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony, not all verbal irony is sarcastic. Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude. There are times, though, where another layer of meaning can be present without that sarcastic tone. Alright, now go out there and find those examples of verbal irony and sarcasm. Good luck! No, seriously, I mean it, good luck. No, no, really, I truly want to wish you luck on this difficult task. Ok, ok, sincerely good luck. You can do it! No verbal irony here.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Great weather we're having! Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right? Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when someone says, "Great weather we're having," it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone says, "Great weather we're having," he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes. When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the second example: "Awesome job!" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So when the passenger says, "Awesome job!" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. "You're a talented athlete," said to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant. That is verbal irony. You have said the opposite of what you mean. Additionally, since you have the intention of mocking this poor person, you have not only been verbally ironic, but sarcastic as well. Beware, though. While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony, not all verbal irony is sarcastic. Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude. There are times, though, where another layer of meaning can be present without that sarcastic tone. Alright, now go out there and find those examples of verbal irony and sarcasm. Good luck! No, seriously, I mean it, good luck. No, no, really, I truly want to wish you luck on this difficult task. Ok, ok, sincerely good luck. You can do it! No verbal irony here.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: Can verbal irony be present without sarcasm? 

However, the options provided for Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the relationship between verbal irony and compliments.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly address the relationship between verbal irony and compliments, we need to find the closest match based on the concept of verbal irony. 

A suitable alternative is Question 7: Which of the following examples is NOT an instance of verbal irony? 

This question assesses the understanding of verbal irony and its distinction from genuine statements. Option C, "I'm so excited to be here!" said by someone who is genuinely excited, is an example of a genuine statement, not verbal irony. Similarly, the ground truth MCQ aims to distinguish verbal irony from genuine statements, such as compliments.

However, an even more suitable match is Question 3: Which of the following examples is an instance of verbal irony? 

This question directly assesses the understanding of verbal irony, including the distinction between genuine statements (compliments) and verbal irony.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3 or 7, with 3 being a more direct match in terms of assessing the understanding of verbal irony, while 7 is more focused on identifying what is NOT verbal irony.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics
from your parents. They're able to calculate probabilities
of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information
from the parents and the family history. But how is this possible? To understand how traits pass
from one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time
to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants
he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles
that rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined
a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait
the dominant one, because it was expressed
in all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded
hybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,
he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait
had been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait
the recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends
on a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors
are called alleles and represent the different
variations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele
Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles
is known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles
are distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram
called the Punnett square. You place the different
alleles on both axes and then figure out
the possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele
as an uppercase "Y" and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase "y." The uppercase Y always
overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,
the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid
a yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad
will give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids
will be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have
any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have
a lot of characteristics. For example, besides
being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all
these possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions
for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it
a little more complex. And lots of things are more
complicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more
about genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which
some characteristics are inherited. But, it all started
with Mendel and his peas.

to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants
he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles
that rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined
a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait
the dominant one, because it was expressed
in all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded
hybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,
he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait
had been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait
the recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends
on a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors
are called alleles and represent the different
variations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele
Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles
is known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles
are distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram
called the Punnett square. You place the different
alleles on both axes and then figure out
the possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele
as an uppercase "Y" and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase "y." The uppercase Y always
overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,
the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid
a yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad
will give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids
will be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have
any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have
a lot of characteristics. For example, besides
being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all
these possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions
for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it
a little more complex. And lots of things are more
complicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more
about genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which
some characteristics are inherited. But, it all started
with Mendel and his peas.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning. Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food. They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate. We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot. She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit." Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room. When you went to get a shot, the words, "This won't hurt a bit," became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning. After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, "Thank you for helping me." In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs. Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists. Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. However, it does not directly ask for another word for operant in the phrase operant conditioning. 

A more suitable match would be to look for a generated MCQ that defines or explains operant conditioning, which could indirectly provide another word for operant. 

In this case, Question 5 defines operant conditioning as "a type of learning that involves consequences leading to changes in voluntary behavior." Although it does not directly provide another word for operant, it does help to explain the concept.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs directly ask for another word for operant in the phrase operant conditioning. But we can see that in the transcript, it is mentioned that "Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning." 

This information is not directly used in any of the generated MCQs. But if we were to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, it would be Question 5, which explains the concept of operant conditioning.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning. Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food. They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate. We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot. She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit." Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room. When you went to get a shot, the words, "This won't hurt a bit," became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning. After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, "Thank you for helping me." In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs. Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists. Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever wonder where most of the food you eat every day comes from? Well, about 60% of the food you eat is carbohydrates. As you can probably tell from its name, carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But where do these atoms originally come from and how do they join together to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta? It actually all starts with the air you are exhaling this very minute, specifically the carbon dioxide molecules. Plants are going to breath in this very same carbon dioxide through pores in their skin, called stomata. Plants drink in water from their roots to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and their electrons, in order to build carbohydrates. What is that thing? Well, that's a special plant organelle inside the leaves of plants called a chloroplast. It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll. Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down. We call it fiber and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong. The plant could also turn that glucose into starch, a large molecule that stores energy for the plant. We love eating starch from plants like potatoes, corn, and rice. So you see, when you eat plants, we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis. The plant makes things like starch, which we eat and then break back down into glucose, the first form the plant made. Then, the mitochondria in our cells, powered by the oxygen we breath, can turn glucose into pure energy molecules called ATP. ATP powers all work done by each and every one of your cells, things like communication, movement, and transport. But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP? Well, think of it like this. You're excited to start your summer job at the local ice cream stand, but your boss has just told you that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones. What are you going to be able to do with those ice cream cones? Nothing, which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars. ATP is just like dollars. It is the currency that all cells of life use while glucose is, well, kind of like ice cream. Even plants have mitochondria in their cells to break down the glucose they make into ATP. So as you can see, humans and plants are intricately connected. The air we breath out is used by plants to make the carbohydrates we enjoy so much. And, in the process, they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules we need to breath in in order that our mitochondria can break down our delicous carbohydrate meal.

It actually all starts with the air you are exhaling this very minute, specifically the carbon dioxide molecules. Plants are going to breath in this very same carbon dioxide through pores in their skin, called stomata. Plants drink in water from their roots to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and their electrons, in order to build carbohydrates. What is that thing? Well, that's a special plant organelle inside the leaves of plants called a chloroplast. It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll. Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down. We call it fiber and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong. The plant could also turn that glucose into starch, a large molecule that stores energy for the plant. We love eating starch from plants like potatoes, corn, and rice. So you see, when you eat plants, we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis. The plant makes things like starch, which we eat and then break back down into glucose, the first form the plant made. Then, the mitochondria in our cells, powered by the oxygen we breath, can turn glucose into pure energy molecules called ATP. ATP powers all work done by each and every one of your cells, things like communication, movement, and transport. But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP? Well, think of it like this. You're excited to start your summer job at the local ice cream stand, but your boss has just told you that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones. What are you going to be able to do with those ice cream cones? Nothing, which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars. ATP is just like dollars. It is the currency that all cells of life use while glucose is, well, kind of like ice cream. Even plants have mitochondria in their cells to break down the glucose they make into ATP. So as you can see, humans and plants are intricately connected. The air we breath out is used by plants to make the carbohydrates we enjoy so much. And, in the process, they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules we need to breath in in order that our mitochondria can break down our delicous carbohydrate meal.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar By now, I'm sure you know that in just about anything you do in life, you need numbers. In particular, though, some fields don't just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a "matrix," and many of them hanging out together, "matrices". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let's get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can't divide them, but that's a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that's pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there's more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It's not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here's how it works. Let's say you have two matrices. Let's make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there's two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let's put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here's your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There's one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can't be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you're careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it's pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There's so much you can do with them. For example, let's say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let's say it's "Math rules". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you've got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There's even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it's pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the specific topic of the origin of matrices.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall topic of matrices, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it is still not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the closest match is:

None

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar By now, I'm sure you know that in just about anything you do in life, you need numbers. In particular, though, some fields don't just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a "matrix," and many of them hanging out together, "matrices". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let's get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can't divide them, but that's a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that's pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there's more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It's not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here's how it works. Let's say you have two matrices. Let's make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there's two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let's put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here's your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There's one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can't be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you're careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it's pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There's so much you can do with them. For example, let's say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let's say it's "Math rules". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you've got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There's even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it's pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo all have in common
with the heroes of ancient myths? (Roar) What if I told you they are all variants
of the same hero? Do you believe that? Joseph Campbell did. He studied myths from all over the world
and published a book called "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," retelling dozens of stories and explaining how each
represents the mono-myth, or Hero's Journey. So, what is the "hero's journey"? Think of it as a cycle. The journey begins and ends
in a hero's ordinary world, but the quest passes
through an unfamiliar, special world. Along the way, there are some key events. Think about your favorite book or movie. Does it follow this pattern? Status quo, that's where we start. 1:00: Call to Adventure. The hero receives a mysterious message. An invitation, a challenge? 2:00: Assistance The hero needs some help,
probably from someone older, wiser. 3:00: Departure The hero crosses the threshold
from his normal, safe home, and enters the special
world and adventure. We're not in Kansas anymore. 4:00: Trials Being a hero is hard work: our hero solves a riddle, slays a monster, escapes from a trap. 5:00: Approach It's time to face the biggest ordeal,
the hero's worst fear. (Roar) 6:00: Crisis This is the hero's darkest hour. He faces death and possibly even dies, only to be reborn. 7:00: Treasure (Roar) As a result, the hero
claims some treasure, special recognition, or power. 8:00: Result This can vary between stories. Do the monsters bow down before the hero, or do they chase him as he flees
from the special world? 9:00: Return After all that adventure,
the hero returns to his ordinary world. 10:00: New Life This quest has changed the hero;
he has outgrown his old life. 11:00: Resolution All the tangled plot lines
get straightened out. 12:00: Status Quo, but upgraded to a new level. Nothing is quite the same
once you are a hero. Many popular books and movies follow this ancient
formula pretty closely. But let's see how well "The Hunger Games"
fits the hero's journey template. When does Katniss Everdeen
hear her call to adventure that gets the story moving? When her sister's name
is called from the lottery. How about assistance? Is anyone going to help
her on her adventure? Haymitch. What about departure? Does she leave her ordinary world? She gets on a train to the capital. OK, so you get the idea. What do you have in common
with Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo? Well, you're human, just like them. The Hero's Journey myth
exists in all human cultures and keeps getting updated, because we humans reflect on our world through symbolic stories of our own lives. You leave your comfort zone, have an experience that transforms you, and then you recover and do it again. You don't literally slay
dragons or fight Voldemort, but you face problems just as scary. Joseph Campbell said, "In the cave you fear to enter
lies the treasure you seek." What is the symbolic
cave you fear to enter? Auditions for the school play? Baseball tryouts? Love? Watch for this formula in books,
movies, and TV shows you come across. You will certainly see it again. But also be sensitive
to it in your own life. Listen for your call to adventure. Accept the challenge. Conquer your fear
and claim the treasure you seek. And then, do it all over again.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What is the Hero's Journey, according to Joseph Campbell? 

However, the options provided in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more relevant question would be one that explicitly mentions the two worlds of the hero's journey.

A closer match would be to rephrase Question 3 to focus on the two worlds. However, since that is not an option, we can look at the other questions for a match.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, Question 3 remains the closest match in terms of content, but it does not explicitly mention the two worlds.

Therefore, I will choose Question 3 as the closest match, but with the caveat that it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the Hero's Journey stages.

The ground truth MCQ asks about when the hero realizes they are changed or have outgrown their old life. The closest stage mentioned in the generated MCQs is the "New Life" stage, which is mentioned in Question 8.

However, Question 8 does not directly ask about when the hero realizes they are changed, but rather what the final stage of the Hero's Journey is.

Considering the options, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but it's still not a direct match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What is the title of Joseph Campbell's book that explains the concept of the Hero's Journey?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the author associated with the concept of the hero's journey, it does mention Joseph Campbell, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ. However, a more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the author.

A closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly ask about the author associated with the concept of the hero's journey. However, some questions do mention Joseph Campbell.

Considering the options and the content, I would argue that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match but rather a question that provides relevant information about Joseph Campbell.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the given options, I would select:

**Question 2**

But please note that this is not a direct match.

If the generated MCQs were modified to include a question like:

"What author is most associated with the concept of the hero's journey?"

Then, that would be a direct match.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo all have in common
with the heroes of ancient myths? (Roar) What if I told you they are all variants
of the same hero? Do you believe that? Joseph Campbell did. He studied myths from all over the world
and published a book called "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," retelling dozens of stories and explaining how each
represents the mono-myth, or Hero's Journey. So, what is the "hero's journey"? Think of it as a cycle. The journey begins and ends
in a hero's ordinary world, but the quest passes
through an unfamiliar, special world. Along the way, there are some key events. Think about your favorite book or movie. Does it follow this pattern? Status quo, that's where we start. 1:00: Call to Adventure. The hero receives a mysterious message. An invitation, a challenge? 2:00: Assistance The hero needs some help,
probably from someone older, wiser. 3:00: Departure The hero crosses the threshold
from his normal, safe home, and enters the special
world and adventure. We're not in Kansas anymore. 4:00: Trials Being a hero is hard work: our hero solves a riddle, slays a monster, escapes from a trap. 5:00: Approach It's time to face the biggest ordeal,
the hero's worst fear. (Roar) 6:00: Crisis This is the hero's darkest hour. He faces death and possibly even dies, only to be reborn. 7:00: Treasure (Roar) As a result, the hero
claims some treasure, special recognition, or power. 8:00: Result This can vary between stories. Do the monsters bow down before the hero, or do they chase him as he flees
from the special world? 9:00: Return After all that adventure,
the hero returns to his ordinary world. 10:00: New Life This quest has changed the hero;
he has outgrown his old life. 11:00: Resolution All the tangled plot lines
get straightened out. 12:00: Status Quo, but upgraded to a new level. Nothing is quite the same
once you are a hero. Many popular books and movies follow this ancient
formula pretty closely. But let's see how well "The Hunger Games"
fits the hero's journey template. When does Katniss Everdeen
hear her call to adventure that gets the story moving? When her sister's name
is called from the lottery. How about assistance? Is anyone going to help
her on her adventure? Haymitch. What about departure? Does she leave her ordinary world? She gets on a train to the capital. OK, so you get the idea. What do you have in common
with Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo? Well, you're human, just like them. The Hero's Journey myth
exists in all human cultures and keeps getting updated, because we humans reflect on our world through symbolic stories of our own lives. You leave your comfort zone, have an experience that transforms you, and then you recover and do it again. You don't literally slay
dragons or fight Voldemort, but you face problems just as scary. Joseph Campbell said, "In the cave you fear to enter
lies the treasure you seek." What is the symbolic
cave you fear to enter? Auditions for the school play? Baseball tryouts? Love? Watch for this formula in books,
movies, and TV shows you come across. You will certainly see it again. But also be sensitive
to it in your own life. Listen for your call to adventure. Accept the challenge. Conquer your fear
and claim the treasure you seek. And then, do it all over again.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Of all the spectacles mankind has viewed through a telescope, there are few lovelier than a spiral galaxy. Majestic whirlpools of stars, they rotate in a stately and predictable dance. The fact that we see many billions of them in our telescopes tells us they are both common and stable. It is perhaps surprising that it is relatively easy to understand the inner workings of these cosmic pinwheels. By combining physical principles worked out by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century, with the observed amount of mass in a galaxy, scientists can calculate the rates at which these galaxies rotate. Using these techniques, astronomers predict how fast stars at different distances from the center of the galaxy should move. Stars very close to the center move slowly. That's because there is very little mass between them and the center of the galaxy to pull them along. Stars a bit further away move faster, because they are being pulled by all of the stars in between them and the center. As we get really far away, the stars are predicted to move slowly again. Their great distance reduces gravity to a gentle tug, so they move leisurely in their orbits. Knowing this, scientists looked at the galaxies and measured how fast stars were moving. To their surprise, they found that while the stars closer to the center of the galaxy behaved as predicted, those further away moved far too quickly. This observation was devastating to the tradtional theories of gravity and motion. If the stars were moving as fast as their measurement suggested, galaxies should have torn themselves apart. It was a crisis, and astronomers and physicists scrambled to find a mistake in their calculation. Was Newton's theory of gravity wrong? Was his theory of motion wrong? Or was it possible that astronomers had incorrectly measured the galaxy's mass? All options were investigated, and all were ruled out. Except one. Today, scientists believe that the answer lies in a previously unknown kind of matter, called dark matter. This dark matter can be envisioned as a cloud which surrounds most galaxies. This matter is very unusual. It is affected by gravity, but it is invisible to visible light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The name "dark matter" originates in this form of matter's inability to emit or absorb light. Dark matter adds to the gravity of the galaxy and explains the orbital speed of stars far from the galactic center. Dark matter has not yet been directly observed, but scientists believe that it is likely to be real, mostly because the other options have been ruled out. Using dozens of approaches, astronomers and physicists continue to search for direct evidence that would prove that the dark matter hypothesis is true. This question is one of the most important physics research questions of the 21st century.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 is the most relevant, as it asks about the observed rate of movement for stars far away from the center of a galaxy. Although it does not specifically ask about the maximum orbital speed, it is related to the topic of star movement in galaxies.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 4

Please note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match to the ground truth MCQ, and Question 4 is only a rough approximation based on the topic relevance.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Of all the spectacles mankind has viewed through a telescope, there are few lovelier than a spiral galaxy. Majestic whirlpools of stars, they rotate in a stately and predictable dance. The fact that we see many billions of them in our telescopes tells us they are both common and stable. It is perhaps surprising that it is relatively easy to understand the inner workings of these cosmic pinwheels. By combining physical principles worked out by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century, with the observed amount of mass in a galaxy, scientists can calculate the rates at which these galaxies rotate. Using these techniques, astronomers predict how fast stars at different distances from the center of the galaxy should move. Stars very close to the center move slowly. That's because there is very little mass between them and the center of the galaxy to pull them along. Stars a bit further away move faster, because they are being pulled by all of the stars in between them and the center. As we get really far away, the stars are predicted to move slowly again. Their great distance reduces gravity to a gentle tug, so they move leisurely in their orbits. Knowing this, scientists looked at the galaxies and measured how fast stars were moving. To their surprise, they found that while the stars closer to the center of the galaxy behaved as predicted, those further away moved far too quickly. This observation was devastating to the tradtional theories of gravity and motion. If the stars were moving as fast as their measurement suggested, galaxies should have torn themselves apart. It was a crisis, and astronomers and physicists scrambled to find a mistake in their calculation. Was Newton's theory of gravity wrong? Was his theory of motion wrong? Or was it possible that astronomers had incorrectly measured the galaxy's mass? All options were investigated, and all were ruled out. Except one. Today, scientists believe that the answer lies in a previously unknown kind of matter, called dark matter. This dark matter can be envisioned as a cloud which surrounds most galaxies. This matter is very unusual. It is affected by gravity, but it is invisible to visible light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The name "dark matter" originates in this form of matter's inability to emit or absorb light. Dark matter adds to the gravity of the galaxy and explains the orbital speed of stars far from the galactic center. Dark matter has not yet been directly observed, but scientists believe that it is likely to be real, mostly because the other options have been ruled out. Using dozens of approaches, astronomers and physicists continue to search for direct evidence that would prove that the dark matter hypothesis is true. This question is one of the most important physics research questions of the 21st century.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: Why do scientists believe that dark matter is likely to be real?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks which statement is not true about dark matter, and one of the options (D) states that the dark matter hypothesis has been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. Question 8 touches on a similar idea, asking why scientists believe dark matter is likely to be real, and option B states that it is because the other options have been ruled out. This is related to the idea that the dark matter hypothesis has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt, but rather is considered likely due to the lack of alternative explanations.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, and Question 8 is the closest match, but not an exact match.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose:

**8**

But please keep in mind that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo (Music) The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth? Scientists who are called astrobiologists are trying to find that out right now. Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out if there's microbial life on Mars, or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan. But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI. SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence that intelligent creatures elsewhere have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort. But how likely is it that they will manage to find a signal? There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI, but something called the Drake equation, named after Frank Drake, can help us organize our thinking about what might be required for successful detection. If you've dealt with equations before, then you probably expect that there will be a solution to the equation, a right answer. The Drake equation, however, is different, because there are so many unknowns. It has no right answer. As we learn more about our universe and our place within it, some of the unknowns get better known, and we can estimate an answer a bit better. But there won't be a definite answer to the Drake equation until SETI succeeds or something else proves that Earthlings are the only intelligent species in our portion of the cosmos. In the meantime, it is really useful to consider the unknowns. The Drake equation attempts to estimate the number of technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy -- we call that N -- with whom we could make contact, and it's usually written as: N equals R-star multiplied by f-sub-p multiplied by n-sub-e multiplied by f-sub-l multiplied by f-sub-i multiplied by f-sub-c and lastly, multiplied by capital L. All those factors multiplied together help to estimate the number of technological civilizations that we might be able to detect right now. R-star is the rate at which stars have been born in the Milky Way Galaxy over the last few billion years, so it's a number that is stars per year. Our galaxy is 10 billion years old, and early in its history stars formed at a different rate. All of the f-factors are fractions. Each one must be less than or equal to one. F-sub-p is the fraction of stars that have planets. N-sub-e is the average number of habitable planets in any planetary system. F-sub-l is the fraction of planets on which life actually begins and f-sub-i is the fraction of all those life forms that develop intelligence. F-sub-c is the fraction of intelligent life that develops a civilization that decides to use some sort of transmitting technology. And finally, L -- the longevity factor. On average, how many years do those transmitters continue to operate? Astronomers are now almost able to tell us what the product of the first three terms is. We're now finding exoplanets almost everywhere. The fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many, many experts ponder, but nobody knows for sure. So far, we only know of one place in the universe where life exists, and that's right here on Earth. In the next couple of decades, as we explore Mars and Europa and Titan, the discovery of any kind of life there will mean that life will be abundant in the Milky Way. Because if life originated twice within this one Solar System, it means it was easy, and given similar conditions elsewhere, life will happen. So the number two is a very important number here. Scientists, including SETI researchers, often tend to make very crude estimates and acknowledge that there are very large uncertainties in these estimates, in order to make progress. We think we know that R-star and n-sub-e are both numbers that are closer to 10 than, say, to one, and all the f-factors are less than one. Some of them may be much less than one. But of all these unknowns, the biggest unknown is L, so perhaps the most useful version of the Drake equation is simply to say that N is approximately equal to L. The information in this equation is very clear. Unless L is large, N will be small. But, you know, you can also turn that around. If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal in the near future, after examining only a small portion of the stars in the Milky Way, then we learn that L, on average, must be large. Otherwise, we couldn't have succeeded so easily. A physicist named Philip Morrison summarizes by saying that SETI is the archaeology of the future. By this, he meant that because the speed of light is finite, any signals detected from distant technologies will be telling us about their past by the time they reach us. But because L must be large for a successful detection, we also learn about our future, particularly that we can have a long future. We've developed technologies that can send signals into space and humans to the moon, but we've also developed technologies that can destroy the environment, that can wage war with weapons and biological terrorism. In the future, will our technology help stabilize our planet and our population, leading to a very long lifetime for us? Or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage? I encourage you to consider the unknowns in this equation. Why don't you make your own estimates for these unknowns, and see what you come up with for N? Compare that with the estimates made by Frank Drake, Carl Sagan, other scientists or your neighbors. Remember, there's no right answer. Not yet.

Transcriber: Ido Dekkers
Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo (Music) The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth? Scientists who are called astrobiologists are trying to find that out right now. Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out if there's microbial life on Mars, or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan. But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI. SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence that intelligent creatures elsewhere have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort. But how likely is it that they will manage to find a signal? There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI, but something called the Drake equation, named after Frank Drake, can help us organize our thinking about what might be required for successful detection. If you've dealt with equations before, then you probably expect that there will be a solution to the equation, a right answer. The Drake equation, however, is different, because there are so many unknowns. It has no right answer. As we learn more about our universe and our place within it, some of the unknowns get better known, and we can estimate an answer a bit better. But there won't be a definite answer to the Drake equation until SETI succeeds or something else proves that Earthlings are the only intelligent species in our portion of the cosmos. In the meantime, it is really useful to consider the unknowns. The Drake equation attempts to estimate the number of technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy -- we call that N -- with whom we could make contact, and it's usually written as: N equals R-star multiplied by f-sub-p multiplied by n-sub-e multiplied by f-sub-l multiplied by f-sub-i multiplied by f-sub-c and lastly, multiplied by capital L. All those factors multiplied together help to estimate the number of technological civilizations that we might be able to detect right now. R-star is the rate at which stars have been born in the Milky Way Galaxy over the last few billion years, so it's a number that is stars per year. Our galaxy is 10 billion years old, and early in its history stars formed at a different rate. All of the f-factors are fractions. Each one must be less than or equal to one. F-sub-p is the fraction of stars that have planets. N-sub-e is the average number of habitable planets in any planetary system. F-sub-l is the fraction of planets on which life actually begins and f-sub-i is the fraction of all those life forms that develop intelligence. F-sub-c is the fraction of intelligent life that develops a civilization that decides to use some sort of transmitting technology. And finally, L -- the longevity factor. On average, how many years do those transmitters continue to operate? Astronomers are now almost able to tell us what the product of the first three terms is. We're now finding exoplanets almost everywhere. The fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many, many experts ponder, but nobody knows for sure. So far, we only know of one place in the universe where life exists, and that's right here on Earth. In the next couple of decades, as we explore Mars and Europa and Titan, the discovery of any kind of life there will mean that life will be abundant in the Milky Way. Because if life originated twice within this one Solar System, it means it was easy, and given similar conditions elsewhere, life will happen. So the number two is a very important number here. Scientists, including SETI researchers, often tend to make very crude estimates and acknowledge that there are very large uncertainties in these estimates, in order to make progress. We think we know that R-star and n-sub-e are both numbers that are closer to 10 than, say, to one, and all the f-factors are less than one. Some of them may be much less than one. But of all these unknowns, the biggest unknown is L, so perhaps the most useful version of the Drake equation is simply to say that N is approximately equal to L. The information in this equation is very clear. Unless L is large, N will be small. But, you know, you can also turn that around. If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal in the near future, after examining only a small portion of the stars in the Milky Way, then we learn that L, on average, must be large. Otherwise, we couldn't have succeeded so easily. A physicist named Philip Morrison summarizes by saying that SETI is the archaeology of the future. By this, he meant that because the speed of light is finite, any signals detected from distant technologies will be telling us about their past by the time they reach us. But because L must be large for a successful detection, we also learn about our future, particularly that we can have a long future. We've developed technologies that can send signals into space and humans to the moon, but we've also developed technologies that can destroy the environment, that can wage war with weapons and biological terrorism. In the future, will our technology help stabilize our planet and our population, leading to a very long lifetime for us? Or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage? I encourage you to consider the unknowns in this equation. Why don't you make your own estimates for these unknowns, and see what you come up with for N? Compare that with the estimates made by Frank Drake, Carl Sagan, other scientists or your neighbors. Remember, there's no right answer. Not yet.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6 is not the most similar, but Question 9 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ. However, the most similar question is Question 8 and Question 9 combined. Since we can only choose one, let's choose Question 8: What is the significance of the longevity factor (L) in the Drake equation? Options: A. It represents the number of years that a technological civilization can exist., B. It represents the number of years that a planet can support life., C. It represents the number of years that a star can shine., D. It represents the number of years that a signal can travel through space.**

However, the correct answer is not among the options. The correct answer should be something like "It represents the average number of years that a technological civilization continues to operate and transmit signals."

The ground truth MCQ asks about how the Drake equation can be simplified, and the correct answer is "By showing that the number of civilizations we can make contact with is approximately equal to the longevity of those civilizations." This is closely related to the significance of the longevity factor (L) in the Drake equation, which is discussed in Question 8.

(Music) On a typical day at school, endless hours are spent learning the answers to questions. But right now, we'll do the opposite. We're going to focus on questions where you can't learn the answers, because they're unknown. I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy. For example, what would it feel like to be a dog? Do fish feel pain? How about insects? Was the Big Bang just an accident? And is there a God? And if so, how are we so sure that it's a He and not a She? Why do so may innocent people and animals suffer terrible things? Is there really a plan for my life? Is the future yet to be written, or is it already written and we just can't see it? But then, do I have free will? Who am I, anyway? Am I just a biological machine? But then, why am I conscious? What is consciousness? Will robots become conscious one day? I mean, I kind of assumed that some day I would be told the answers to all these questions. I mean, someone must know, right? Huh. Guess what? No one knows. Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever. But diving into them is exciting because it takes you to the edge of knowledge, and you never know what you'll find there.

**Transcript**:
(Music) On a typical day at school, endless hours are spent learning the answers to questions. But right now, we'll do the opposite. We're going to focus on questions where you can't learn the answers, because they're unknown. I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy. For example, what would it feel like to be a dog? Do fish feel pain? How about insects? Was the Big Bang just an accident? And is there a God? And if so, how are we so sure that it's a He and not a She? Why do so may innocent people and animals suffer terrible things? Is there really a plan for my life? Is the future yet to be written, or is it already written and we just can't see it? But then, do I have free will? Who am I, anyway? Am I just a biological machine? But then, why am I conscious? What is consciousness? Will robots become conscious one day? I mean, I kind of assumed that some day I would be told the answers to all these questions. I mean, someone must know, right? Huh. Guess what? No one knows. Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever. But diving into them is exciting because it takes you to the edge of knowledge, and you never know what you'll find there. So, two questions to kick off this series, questions that no one on Earth knows the answer to ... Text: How many universes are there? Why can't we see evidence of alien life?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the irony of the situation, where the speaker is discussing questions with unknown answers. The correct option, "E. B and D", highlights the irony of having multiple-choice questions about a video titled "Questions No One Knows the Answers To" and the folly of trying to understand human consciousness.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6: "Why does the speaker find exploring unknown questions exciting?" comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and content. Although it doesn't directly address the irony, it touches on the speaker's attitude towards exploring unknown questions, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer match is not available, and the best option is to acknowledge that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although the options in Question 3 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. Question 3 asks about a philosophical question mentioned in the transcript, and one of the options (B. Is there a God?) aligns with part of the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not fully capture the scope of the ground truth MCQ, which also mentions the suffering of innocent people.

A more ideal match would be a generated MCQ that includes both aspects of the ground truth MCQ (the existence of God and the suffering of innocent people), but such a question is not present in the provided set. Therefore, Question 3 is the closest match based on the available options.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere out there in that vast universe, there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life, but why don't we see any evidence of it? Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950: "Where is everybody?" Conspiracy theorists claim
that UFOs are visiting all the time and the reports are just being covered up, but honestly, they aren't very convincing. But that leaves a real riddle. In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars, and if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be
half a trillion planets just in our own galaxy. If any one in 10,000 has conditions
that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way. So here's the riddle. Our Earth didn't form until about 9 billion years
after the Big Bang. Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billions or certainly
many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth. If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies
would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power. On Earth, we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate in just 100 years. In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out
across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts, or fleets of colonizing spaceships, or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy, and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors. It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate anything that becomes a threat. Or maybe they're not that intelligent. Or perhaps, the evolution
of an intelligence capable of creating
sophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed. After all, it's only happened once on Earth in 4 billion years. Maybe even that was incredibly lucky. Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy. Or, perhaps, civilization carries with it the seeds of its own destruction through the inability to control
the technologies it creates. But there are numerous
more hopeful answers. For a start, we're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful
amount of money on it. Only a tiny fraction
of the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely
for signs of interesting signals. And perhaps, we're not looking
the right way. Maybe as civilizations develop, they quickly discover
communication technologies far more sophisticated and useful
than electromagnetic waves. Maybe all the action takes place inside the mysterious
recently discovered dark matter, or dark energy, that appear to account
for most of the universe's mass. Or maybe we're looking at the wrong scale. Perhaps intelligent civilizations
come to realize that life is ultimately just complex
patterns of information interacting with each other
in a beautiful way, and that can happen
more efficiently at a small scale. So just as on Earth, clunky stereo systems
have shrunk to beautiful, tiny iPods, maybe intelligent life itself, in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment, has turned itself microscopic, so the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens, and we're just not noticing them. Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life. Well, okay, that's a crazy thought. The aliens made me say it. But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own, and that they outlive their creators. Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase. Well, within the next 15 years, we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information from promising nearby planets that will reveal just how
life-friendly they might be. And meanwhile SETI, the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you, can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search. And here on Earth,
amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different
from the DNA forms we know. All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or, whether indeed, it's just us. Either answer, in its own way, is awe-inspiring, because even if we are alone, the fact that we think and dream, and ask these questions might yet turn out to be
one of the most important facts about the universe. And I have one more piece
of good news for you. The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull. It doesn't. It's actually the opposite. The more you know, the more amazing the world seems. And it's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions, that pull us forward. So, stay curious.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: According to the Kepler space observatory, how many planets could there be in our galaxy? Options: A. Hundreds, B. Thousands, C. Half a trillion, D. Billions**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the most similar in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the discovery of the Kepler Mission, while Question 2 asks about the estimated number of planets in our galaxy according to the Kepler space observatory. Both questions are related to the Kepler Mission and its findings.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be:

**Question: What has the Kepler space observatory discovered? Options: A. Other galaxies, B. Unusual radio signals, C. Unusual clumps of dark matter, D. Planets around nearby stars**

Unfortunately, this question is not among the generated MCQs. Therefore, I recommend Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

just around nearby stars, and if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be
half a trillion planets just in our own galaxy. If any one in 10,000 has conditions
that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way. So here's the riddle. Our Earth didn't form until about 9 billion years
after the Big Bang. Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billions or certainly
many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth. If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies
would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power. On Earth, we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate in just 100 years. In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out
across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts, or fleets of colonizing spaceships, or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy, and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors. It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate anything that becomes a threat. Or maybe they're not that intelligent. Or perhaps, the evolution
of an intelligence capable of creating
sophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed. After all, it's only happened once on Earth in 4 billion years. Maybe even that was incredibly lucky. Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy. Or, perhaps, civilization carries with it the seeds of its own destruction through the inability to control
the technologies it creates. But there are numerous
more hopeful answers. For a start, we're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful
amount of money on it. Only a tiny fraction
of the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely
for signs of interesting signals. And perhaps, we're not looking
the right way. Maybe as civilizations develop, they quickly discover
communication technologies far more sophisticated and useful
than electromagnetic waves. Maybe all the action takes place inside the mysterious
recently discovered dark matter, or dark energy, that appear to account
for most of the universe's mass. Or maybe we're looking at the wrong scale. Perhaps intelligent civilizations
come to realize that life is ultimately just complex
patterns of information interacting with each other
in a beautiful way, and that can happen
more efficiently at a small scale. So just as on Earth, clunky stereo systems
have shrunk to beautiful, tiny iPods, maybe intelligent life itself, in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment, has turned itself microscopic, so the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens, and we're just not noticing them. Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life. Well, okay, that's a crazy thought. The aliens made me say it. But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own, and that they outlive their creators. Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase. Well, within the next 15 years, we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information from promising nearby planets that will reveal just how
life-friendly they might be. And meanwhile SETI, the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you, can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search. And here on Earth,
amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different
from the DNA forms we know. All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or, whether indeed, it's just us. Either answer, in its own way, is awe-inspiring, because even if we are alone, the fact that we think and dream, and ask these questions might yet turn out to be
one of the most important facts about the universe. And I have one more piece
of good news for you. The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull. It doesn't. It's actually the opposite. The more you know, the more amazing the world seems. And it's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions, that pull us forward. So, stay curious.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What is one possible explanation for the lack of evidence of alien life?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only provides one possible explanation, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks for multiple possible answers.

A closer match is not found among the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say that **Question 5** is the most similar, although it would need to be modified to include multiple possible answers to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **5**

However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that combines elements of Questions 4, 5, and others would be needed to create a more accurate match.

**Transcript**:
the pirate films and the romantic films of the 40's was definitely an influence on on Star Wars Errol Flynn kinds of movies I mean everything is of that genre which is the fantasy action-adventure kinds of films of that period of time in the in the cinema look the whole premise of Star Wars was that it was a romantic fantasy in the in the great romantic traditions of mythology and King Arthur and the romantic side of fighting where there was chivalry and honor and that sort of things so in developing a group of peacekeepers who were above everything and an honorable and could make decisions and and bring peace to the galaxy I needed a weapon that was appropriate for those kinds of Jedi the father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow what is it your father's lightsaber this is the weapon of a Jedi Knight not as clumsy or random as a blaster an elegant weapon for a more civilized day it was more a symbol of a simpler time of a time before the Empire taken over a time when honor ruled so it was more of a symbol than it was an actual weapon in the movie moki religions and ancient weapons were no match for a good blaster - sorry kid you don't believe in the force do you the original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords and then I wanted to make it a futuristic kind of sword so I made it a lightsaber which those are of a laser sword to give it that technology edge to it in an age of ray guns and that sort of thing that would deflect the rays and since they're the whole premise was that a Jedi was there to protect himself and not really be offensive but be defensive that a laser sword in a world of ray guns would be a perfect defensive weapon started out as a kind of oriental form of swordplay where there was a lot of honor involved a lot of skill and craft and higher spiritual meaning to the sword fight and so they were very simple and in the beginning of the first film episode 4 it was a fight between a very old man and a man who was only a partially a man and mostly a mechanical beam so it wasn't really much of a sword fight at all but I guess I lost it only a master of evil does the original lightsaber was actually the flash attachment to a four by five camera and we just took the round flash part off and then made it into a lightsaber George was adamant that these things were really really heavy that we couldn't take a hand off we always had to have two like X calibers is 240 50 pounds of weight they were very powerful and a lot of energy in them and so that was you you know you worked with them as if they were heavy so because when he's crashed together they obey these big explosions and all kinds of things as we went on we wanted to have the lightsaber fights become faster and more intense as Luke became more proficient in the art of sword fighting and so we very slowly started moving away from the two-handed form which is more oriental to sometimes using a one-handed form and it's progressed further and further into a more two-handed and one-handed form but originally it was that you needed two hands to hold on to this lightsaber because of the amount of energy that is being swung around see you can do it I call it luck in my experience there's no such thing as luck The effect of the lightsaber was basically a rotating poll that had movie screen material applied to it so that it would reflect its light source packet many times the intensity problem was that when you moved it out of a certain area it went from glowing and looking great to just a rotating pole we rotated with reflective tape so that would flash and it would create light on the actors on that never really worked as soon as they hit each other they broke the lightsabers so then we just used the sticks with the reflective material on it as we moved on we got more proficient at actually doing sword fighting we then use swords that did to have the reflective material but we toned down the fact that we had to shoot the light through the lens and a lot of other things to try to make it so we could be more facile in the way we shot these fights when I beat a tech - I thought it would just be handled and they put in cartoon blades later but if you were if you were sword fighting you you wouldn't know when to stop your hand you needed something to strike every laser sword really is part real and part animated and we need the real poll to tell us where the sword blade is and sometimes we'll use a short blade because they're fighting so close that they would hit the set and things like that and sometimes we use no blade because the blade would turn on in the shop or what they were doing was so complicated that we couldn't do it with swords themselves and then we would add the sword in later but that takes a lot of very careful tracking to figure out where the sword blade would be and even later on in the second and third one when they decided that it was more trouble than was worth to try and get on Sat shots that they just do it all in post we still had part of a shaft just so that there would be something to come up against that really had a lot to do with the advances in special-effects technology than it did in anything else as we got more and more able to do rotoscoping on these swords and we were using more advanced technology was easier for us to follow the sword and copy them and you know create laser swords it is useless to exist don't let yourself be destroyed as obi-wan did even though the like sabers were kind of chintzy when we were shooting him in post-production they were able to give him the look that they needed to have of course the great sound Ben Burtt sound effects the sound of the lightsaber was turned over to Ben Burke in the first film Ben worked you know really right from the very GetGo while I was working on the script and I would tell them that I needed a voice for our - I needed a voice for you know the breathing of Darth Vader I'd need a sound for ray guns I knew sound for laser swords the very first sound I created for the film was the lightsaber and it was I think what happened was I saw some of the Ralph McQuarrie artwork on the wall and I was a picture of Luke lighting at the end of the movie and they had these lightsabers and I thought immediately something went off in my mind and I and I had a feeling for what they would sound like in the booth where we projected films those projectors made a hum when they weren't running they were just idling that the motors would sit there with this kind of magical mysterious humming sound that I thought was musical in a way and I thought that's probably what a lightsaber would sound like yo Paul was a weak old man you can't wind us if you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine and I was searching for some other element and I had a tape recorder with a broken mic cable it was actually the shielding and coming off of it and when I walked past the television set in my apartment it picked up the hum from the picture too directly into the broken wire and that made a buzz and I said that's a great buzz that's not as dangerous so I recorded the buzz now normally a sound person doesn't want to buzz or hum in this case the buzz in the hum were the answer and of course I had to take that sound and make the pass bys and the swishes of the sword out of it and so he spent you know the better part of a year working on those sounds trying to create those sounds the first time I put in the sounds of the lightsabers he was in it you know temporary cut of the film and not much comment was made about it and I but I have since learned that when no comment is made then it's fantastic that it's it's passes the test impressive most impressive ultimately the sound for the laser sword because we wanted something with a lot of energy was a combination of several different sounds from a swooshing vacuum cleaner to kind of clash when when something hits dry ice and we've modified it since then as yes we get weapons that move faster and be a double-edged blade savoring some of the newer films but it's always based on that same recording there's nothing you could have done Luke had you been there you'd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire I want to come with you to Alderaan there's nothing for me here now I want to learn the ways of the force and become a Jedi like my father in every episode from four five and six I kept improving the sword fighting because of the assumption was is that Luke was getting to be a better fighter he was learning more but at the same time he still wasn't you know being trained as an original Jedi would have been trained a Jedi uses the force for knowledge in defense never but tell me why I can't know there is no way nothing more would I teach you today an Empire Strikes Back it's the first time that the antagonist and pro Tigers actually fight each other so that it is a very big fight and Luke now has become proficient enough to be able to face Darth Vader so it's a slightly one-sided sword fight where Vader has the advantage over him but Luke didn't know that Vader was his father for the most really for fight part so that what it was happening is he thought he was fighting his bitter enemy and so he was fighting as hard as he could he thought he was fighting the man killed his father fighting the man who killed obi-wan Kenobi fighting the man who you know would personify evil in the universe and then as we go on into the next fight it becomes more of a an equal confrontation in the next one The Return of the Jedi he knew he was fighting his father I see you have constructed a new lightsaber he knew that the Emperor was behind all this your skills are complete and he knew that the issues that he was dealing with much larger than just the sword fight indeed you are powerful as the emperor has foreseen and so that sword fight really centered on the more emotional context the sword fight takes place in than the actual fighting itself that was the climax of the film rather than having it be a technological warfare blow up the Death Star kind of thing it was really more of a personal fight between a father and his son then when we move to the prequel where there were Jedi on their full flower and fighting as they were in the past you know well trained Jedi then we had to make the sword fights much much faster much more sophisticated and much more aggressive in terms of the way they're fought and we continued that brave of you boy what I would have thought you had learned your lesson hi I'm miss Lola manikin the fights becomes actually much more ferocious in save ones in Episode four five and six well at your head held that right now this is just the beginning each one builds on the other because the fights become more personal until we get to Episode three where it's a very personal form of fighting this particular one they have to fight each other so this is very very long fight difference between the two characters is that Obi one has more experience but Anika is more powerful that was good hey thanks everybody you know I'm here today as Luke Skywalker but I'm also here to talk about Sprint as you can see you stand to save up to 17 cents a month over the more dependable providers in the history of Hollywood few stars have so captured the imagination of fans as r2d2 the Vice

**Transcript**:
the pirate films and the romantic films of the 40's was definitely an influence on on Star Wars Errol Flynn kinds of movies I mean everything is of that genre which is the fantasy action-adventure kinds of films of that period of time in the in the cinema look the whole premise of Star Wars was that it was a romantic fantasy in the in the great romantic traditions of mythology and King Arthur and the romantic side of fighting where there was chivalry and honor and that sort of things so in developing a group of peacekeepers who were above everything and an honorable and could make decisions and and bring peace to the galaxy I needed a weapon that was appropriate for those kinds of Jedi the father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow what is it your father's lightsaber this is the weapon of a Jedi Knight not as clumsy or random as a blaster an elegant weapon for a more civilized day it was more a symbol of a simpler time of a time before the Empire taken over a time when honor ruled so it was more of a symbol than it was an actual weapon in the movie moki religions and ancient weapons were no match for a good blaster - sorry kid you don't believe in the force do you the original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords and then I wanted to make it a futuristic kind of sword so I made it a lightsaber which those are of a laser sword to give it that technology edge to it in an age of ray guns and that sort of thing that would deflect the rays and since they're the whole premise was that a Jedi was there to protect himself and not really be offensive but be defensive that a laser sword in a world of ray guns would be a perfect defensive weapon started out as a kind of oriental form of swordplay where there was a lot of honor involved a lot of skill and craft and higher spiritual meaning to the sword fight and so they were very simple and in the beginning of the first film episode 4 it was a fight between a very old man and a man who was only a partially a man and mostly a mechanical beam so it wasn't really much of a sword fight at all but I guess I lost it only a master of evil does the original lightsaber was actually the flash attachment to a four by five camera and we just took the round flash part off and then made it into a lightsaber George was adamant that these things were really really heavy that we couldn't take a hand off we always had to have two like X calibers is 240 50 pounds of weight they were very powerful and a lot of energy in them and so that was you you know you worked with them as if they were heavy so because when he's crashed together they obey these big explosions and all kinds of things as we went on we wanted to have the lightsaber fights become faster and more intense as Luke became more proficient in the art of sword fighting and so we very slowly started moving away from the two-handed form which is more oriental to sometimes using a one-handed form and it's progressed further and further into a more two-handed and one-handed form but originally it was that you needed two hands to hold on to this lightsaber because of the amount of energy that is being swung around see you can do it I call it luck in my experience there's no such thing as luck The effect of the lightsaber was basically a rotating poll that had movie screen material applied to it so that it would reflect its light source packet many times the intensity problem was that when you moved it out of a certain area it went from glowing and looking great to just a rotating pole we rotated with reflective tape so that would flash and it would create light on the actors on that never really worked as soon as they hit each other they broke the lightsabers so then we just used the sticks with the reflective material on it as we moved on we got more proficient at actually doing sword fighting we then use swords that did to have the reflective material but we toned down the fact that we had to shoot the light through the lens and a lot of other things to try to make it so we could be more facile in the way we shot these fights when I beat a tech - I thought it would just be handled and they put in cartoon blades later but if you were if you were sword fighting you you wouldn't know when to stop your hand you needed something to strike every laser sword really is part real and part animated and we need the real poll to tell us where the sword blade is and sometimes we'll use a short blade because they're fighting so close that they would hit the set and things like that and sometimes we use no blade because the blade would turn on in the shop or what they were doing was so complicated that we couldn't do it with swords themselves and then we would add the sword in later but that takes a lot of very careful tracking to figure out where the sword blade would be and even later on in the second and third one when they decided that it was more trouble than was worth to try and get on Sat shots that they just do it all in post we still had part of a shaft just so that there would be something to come up against that really had a lot to do with the advances in special-effects technology than it did in anything else as we got more and more able to do rotoscoping on these swords and we were using more advanced technology was easier for us to follow the sword and copy them and you know create laser swords it is useless to exist don't let yourself be destroyed as obi-wan did even though the like sabers were kind of chintzy when we were shooting him in post-production they were able to give him the look that they needed to have of course the great sound Ben Burtt sound effects the sound of the lightsaber was turned over to Ben Burke in the first film Ben worked you know really right from the very GetGo while I was working on the script and I would tell them that I needed a voice for our - I needed a voice for you know the breathing of Darth Vader I'd need a sound for ray guns I knew sound for laser swords the very first sound I created for the film was the lightsaber and it was I think what happened was I saw some of the Ralph McQuarrie artwork on the wall and I was a picture of Luke lighting at the end of the movie and they had these lightsabers and I thought immediately something went off in my mind and I and I had a feeling for what they would sound like in the booth where we projected films those projectors made a hum when they weren't running they were just idling that the motors would sit there with this kind of magical mysterious humming sound that I thought was musical in a way and I thought that's probably what a lightsaber would sound like yo Paul was a weak old man you can't wind us if you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine and I was searching for some other element and I had a tape recorder with a broken mic cable it was actually the shielding and coming off of it and when I walked past the television set in my apartment it picked up the hum from the picture too directly into the broken wire and that made a buzz and I said that's a great buzz that's not as dangerous so I recorded the buzz now normally a sound person doesn't want to buzz or hum in this case the buzz in the hum were the answer and of course I had to take that sound and make the

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Luke Skywalker's father wanting him to have something when he was old enough, and who wouldn't allow it. The correct option is "His father's lightsaber; his uncle".

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match, as it asks about the original concept for the Jedi's primary weapon, and one of the options is "A sword", which is related to the lightsaber. However, the question intent and options are not an exact match.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is the most similar, I would suggest:

Have you ever been waiting in line
at the grocery store, innocently perusing the magazine rack,
when a song pops into your head? Not the whole song, but a fragment of it
that plays and replays until you find yourself unloading
the vegetables in time to the beat. You've been struck by an earworm,
and you're not alone. Over 90% of people are plagued
by earworms at least once a week, and about a quarter of people
experience them several times a day. They tend to burrow in during tasks
that don't require much attention, say, when waiting on water to boil or a traffic light to change. This phenomenon is one 
of the mind's great mysteries. Scientists don't know 
exactly why it's so easy for tunes to get stuck in our heads. From a psychological perspective, earworms are an example of mental imagery. This imagery can be visual, like when you close your eyes
and imagine a red wagon, or it can be auditory, like when you imagine
the sound of a baby screaming, or oil sizzling in a pan. Earworms are a special form 
of auditory imagery because they're involuntary. You don't plug your ears
and try to imagine "Who Let the Dogs Out," or, well, you probably don't. It just intrudes onto 
your mental soundscape and hangs around 
like an unwanted house guest. Earworms tend to be quite vivid and they're normally made up of a tune,
rather than, say, harmonies. A remarkable feature of earworms
is their tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating again and again
for minutes or hours. Also remarkable is the role
of repetition in sparking earworms. Songs tend to get stuck when 
we listen to them recently and repeatedly. If repetition is such a trigger, then perhaps we can blame our earworms
on modern technology. The last hundred years have seen
an incredible proliferation of devices that help you listen 
to the same thing again and again. Records, cassettes, CDs, 
or streamed audio files. Have these technologies bread some
kind of unique, contemporary experience, and are earworms just a product
of the late 20th century? The answer comes from an unlikely source: Mark Twain. In 1876, just one year 
before the phonograph was invented, he wrote a short story
imagining a sinister takeover of an entire town by a rhyming jingle. This reference, and others, show us that earworms seem 
to be a basic psychological phenomenon, perhaps exacerbated 
by recording technology but not new to this century. So yes, every great historical figure,
from Shakespeare to Sacajawea, may well have wandered around
with a song stuck in their head. Besides music, it's hard to think
of another case of intrusive imagery that's so widespread. Why music? Why don't watercolors 
get stuck in our heads? Or the taste of cheesy taquitos? One theory has to do with the way music
is represented in memory. When we listen to a song we know, we're constantly hearing forward in time,
anticipating the next note. It's hard for us to think about one
particular musical moment in isolation. If we want to think about the pitch
of the word "you" in "Happy Birthday," we have to start back at "Happy," and sing through until we get to "you." In this way, a tune 
is sort of like a habit. Just like once you start tying your shoe, you're on automatic 
until you tighten the bow, once a tune is suggested because, for example, someone says,
"my umbrella," we have to play through until it
reaches a natural stopping point, "ella, ella, ella." But this is largely speculation. The basic fact remains we don't know
exactly why we're susceptible to earworms. But understanding them better 
could give us important clues to the workings of the human brain. Maybe the next time we're plagued by a Taylor Swift tune 
that just won't go away, we'll use it as the starting point
for a scientific odyssey that will unlock important mysteries
about basic cognition. And if not, well, 
we can just shake it off.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 9 does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and content, I re-examined the generated MCQs and found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent, as it relates to the concept of earworms and mental imagery.

But again, since Question 3 does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of options and content, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None of the above, but if I really had to choose one: 3

is represented in memory. When we listen to a song we know, we're constantly hearing forward in time,
anticipating the next note. It's hard for us to think about one
particular musical moment in isolation. If we want to think about the pitch
of the word "you" in "Happy Birthday," we have to start back at "Happy," and sing through until we get to "you." In this way, a tune 
is sort of like a habit. Just like once you start tying your shoe, you're on automatic 
until you tighten the bow, once a tune is suggested because, for example, someone says,
"my umbrella," we have to play through until it
reaches a natural stopping point, "ella, ella, ella." But this is largely speculation. The basic fact remains we don't know
exactly why we're susceptible to earworms. But understanding them better 
could give us important clues to the workings of the human brain. Maybe the next time we're plagued by a Taylor Swift tune 
that just won't go away, we'll use it as the starting point
for a scientific odyssey that will unlock important mysteries
about basic cognition. And if not, well, 
we can just shake it off.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been waiting in line
at the grocery store, innocently perusing the magazine rack,
when a song pops into your head? Not the whole song, but a fragment of it
that plays and replays until you find yourself unloading
the vegetables in time to the beat. You've been struck by an earworm,
and you're not alone. Over 90% of people are plagued
by earworms at least once a week, and about a quarter of people
experience them several times a day. They tend to burrow in during tasks
that don't require much attention, say, when waiting on water to boil or a traffic light to change. This phenomenon is one 
of the mind's great mysteries. Scientists don't know 
exactly why it's so easy for tunes to get stuck in our heads. From a psychological perspective, earworms are an example of mental imagery. This imagery can be visual, like when you close your eyes
and imagine a red wagon, or it can be auditory, like when you imagine
the sound of a baby screaming, or oil sizzling in a pan. Earworms are a special form 
of auditory imagery because they're involuntary. You don't plug your ears
and try to imagine "Who Let the Dogs Out," or, well, you probably don't. It just intrudes onto 
your mental soundscape and hangs around 
like an unwanted house guest. Earworms tend to be quite vivid and they're normally made up of a tune,
rather than, say, harmonies. A remarkable feature of earworms
is their tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating again and again
for minutes or hours. Also remarkable is the role
of repetition in sparking earworms. Songs tend to get stuck when 
we listen to them recently and repeatedly. If repetition is such a trigger, then perhaps we can blame our earworms
on modern technology. The last hundred years have seen
an incredible proliferation of devices that help you listen 
to the same thing again and again. Records, cassettes, CDs, 
or streamed audio files. Have these technologies bread some
kind of unique, contemporary experience, and are earworms just a product
of the late 20th century? The answer comes from an unlikely source: Mark Twain. In 1876, just one year 
before the phonograph was invented, he wrote a short story
imagining a sinister takeover of an entire town by a rhyming jingle. This reference, and others, show us that earworms seem 
to be a basic psychological phenomenon, perhaps exacerbated 
by recording technology but not new to this century. So yes, every great historical figure,
from Shakespeare to Sacajawea, may well have wandered around
with a song stuck in their head. Besides music, it's hard to think
of another case of intrusive imagery that's so widespread. Why music? Why don't watercolors 
get stuck in our heads? Or the taste of cheesy taquitos? One theory has to do with the way music
is represented in memory. When we listen to a song we know, we're constantly hearing forward in time,
anticipating the next note. It's hard for us to think about one

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1845, the bright green
leaves of potato plants dotted the Irish countryside. For over 200 years, 
the South American vegetable had thrived in Ireland’s rough terrain
and unpredictable weather. Packed with carbohydrates,
vitamins, and minerals, the potato was a remarkably
nutrient-rich crop that made it easy for less wealthy
families to maintain a balanced diet. By the mid-19th century, potatoes had
supplanted other staple foods. And since British mandates ensured
Ireland’s more valuable agricultural products were exported, roughly half the country’s
8.5 million residents lived almost entirely on potatoes. But when harvesting began in 1845, farmers found their potatoes
blackened and shriveled. Those who ate them suffered severe
stomach cramps and even death. Today, we know the culprit was
Phytophthora infestans— a fungus that flourished in the season’s
unusually damp weather. But at the time it was simply
called “the blight.” The fungus likely originated
in the Americas, traveling across the Atlantic on ships. And while it destroyed potato harvests
across Europe, wealthier countries— then as today—
generally fared better, as they had more resources to draw on. Meanwhile, the southern and western
regions of Ireland were already impoverished
and entirely dependent on the single crop, making them disproportionately vulnerable. The impacts of food insecurity are often
most severe at the poverty line. But while the failed harvest
created a class crisis, the government's response turned
it into a national catastrophe. For centuries, Ireland had been
under varying degrees of English control, and by 1845,
it was part of the United Kingdom with its government based in London. During the famine’s first year, this distant ruling body imported corn
from North America and offered the Irish employment
on public works projects. But this relief only caused more problems. Imported food was poorly distributed
and offered insufficient nutrition, making the previously healthy population
more vulnerable to disease, and increasing maternal
and child mortality. Worse still, the British continued
to export Ireland’s grain and livestock. Meanwhile, the public works projects
required lengthy shifts of grueling manual labour and
were far from where most workers lived. For example, just one of countless tragic
incidences is the story of Thomas Malone, who walked 18 kilometers roundtrip
to work every day. One night, exhausted and starving, he collapsed and died
just before reaching home, leaving behind his wife and six children. Despite the year’s countless tragedies,
many families managed to scrape by. But in 1846, the damp weather returned
and the blight worsened, impacting 75% of Ireland's potato yield. British relief efforts diminished
substantially in the famine’s second year. And while international aid
helped save lives, the overall need was enormous. As the crisis wore on, the government
limited who was eligible for relief and tasked Ireland with funding the relief
efforts themselves by increasing local taxes. Most modern historians view these
disastrous policies as stemming from a mix
of toxic religious ideology, laissez-faire economic policies,
and political infighting. British news sources callously
depicted the Irish as lazy, simple-minded alcoholics, and some London decision-makers believed
the famine was God’s punishment for these sinful behaviors. Other government officials purposefully
blocked efforts to provide meaningful relief
due to internal political rivalries. As with famines and food insecurity today, it wasn't a lack of resources preventing
the British from aiding Ireland, but rather a lack of political will. Seven years after the blight began, Ireland’s weather patterns
returned to normal and the potato crop finally stabilised. But over 1 million people had perished
from starvation, malnutrition, and disease. Between 1 and 2 million more
fled the country, beginning a trend that dropped Ireland’s
population to half its pre-famine levels by the 1920s. Today, climate change is making
extreme weather more common and sustained, leading countless agricultural communities
to face similar struggles. Just as in Ireland,
farmers living on the margins are increasingly facing starvation,
malnutrition, and disease due to global weather patterns
for which they bear little responsibility. But history doesn’t have to repeat itself
if governments and institutions can provide the kind of aid
these regions need: relief efforts that are coordinated
and ongoing, provide sufficient nutrition
to prevent disease, and are offered with compassion
rather than judgment.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1845, the bright green
leaves of potato plants dotted the Irish countryside. For over 200 years, 
the South American vegetable had thrived in Ireland’s rough terrain
and unpredictable weather. Packed with carbohydrates,
vitamins, and minerals, the potato was a remarkably
nutrient-rich crop that made it easy for less wealthy
families to maintain a balanced diet. By the mid-19th century, potatoes had
supplanted other staple foods. And since British mandates ensured
Ireland’s more valuable agricultural products were exported, roughly half the country’s
8.5 million residents lived almost entirely on potatoes. But when harvesting began in 1845, farmers found their potatoes
blackened and shriveled. Those who ate them suffered severe
stomach cramps and even death. Today, we know the culprit was
Phytophthora infestans— a fungus that flourished in the season’s
unusually damp weather. But at the time it was simply
called “the blight.” The fungus likely originated
in the Americas, traveling across the Atlantic on ships. And while it destroyed potato harvests
across Europe, wealthier countries— then as today—
generally fared better, as they had more resources to draw on. Meanwhile, the southern and western
regions of Ireland were already impoverished
and entirely dependent on the single crop, making them disproportionately vulnerable. The impacts of food insecurity are often
most severe at the poverty line. But while the failed harvest
created a class crisis, the government's response turned
it into a national catastrophe. For centuries, Ireland had been
under varying degrees of English control, and by 1845,
it was part of the United Kingdom with its government based in London. During the famine’s first year, this distant ruling body imported corn
from North America and offered the Irish employment
on public works projects. But this relief only caused more problems. Imported food was poorly distributed
and offered insufficient nutrition, making the previously healthy population
more vulnerable to disease, and increasing maternal
and child mortality. Worse still, the British continued
to export Ireland’s grain and livestock. Meanwhile, the public works projects
required lengthy shifts of grueling manual labour and
were far from where most workers lived. For example, just one of countless tragic
incidences is the story of Thomas Malone, who walked 18 kilometers roundtrip
to work every day. One night, exhausted and starving, he collapsed and died
just before reaching home, leaving behind his wife and six children. Despite the year’s countless tragedies,
many families managed to scrape by. But in 1846, the damp weather returned
and the blight worsened, impacting 75% of Ireland's potato yield. British relief efforts diminished
substantially in the famine’s second year. And while international aid
helped save lives, the overall need was enormous. As the crisis wore on, the government
limited who was eligible for relief and tasked Ireland with funding the relief
efforts themselves by increasing local taxes. Most modern historians view these
disastrous policies as stemming from a mix
of toxic religious ideology, laissez-faire economic policies,
and political infighting. British news sources callously
depicted the Irish as lazy, simple-minded alcoholics, and some London decision-makers believed
the famine was God’s punishment for these sinful behaviors. Other government officials purposefully
blocked efforts to provide meaningful relief
due to internal political rivalries. As with famines and food insecurity today, it wasn't a lack of resources preventing
the British from aiding Ireland, but rather a lack of political will. Seven years after the blight began, Ireland’s weather patterns
returned to normal and the potato crop finally stabilised. But over 1 million people had perished
from starvation, malnutrition, and disease. Between 1 and 2 million more
fled the country, beginning a trend that dropped Ireland’s
population to half its pre-famine levels by the 1920s. Today, climate change is making
extreme weather more common and sustained, leading countless agricultural communities
to face similar struggles. Just as in Ireland,
farmers living on the margins are increasingly facing starvation,
malnutrition, and disease due to global weather patterns
for which they bear little responsibility. But history doesn’t have to repeat itself
if governments and institutions can provide the kind of aid
these regions need: relief efforts that are coordinated
and ongoing, provide sufficient nutrition
to prevent disease, and are offered with compassion
rather than judgment.

**Transcript**:
The vast, white ice surface of Antarctica stretches for over 3 million
square kilometers: empty, desolate,
and almost completely silent. But appearances can be deceiving. On the coast of this expanse, just a few meters beneath the ice
lies a multicolored constellation of life. This remarkably diverse realm is home
to over 8,000 species of sea denizens who rely on an arsenal
of otherworldly traits to survive. So how do these species not only live,
but thrive, in conditions most animals
would be unable to bear? Antarctic waters are some of the most
consistently frigid in the world, hovering below 0 degrees Celsius
for a large portion of the year. This means burning energy
too quickly can be deadly, so survival in this ecosystem
looks slow and steady. Freezing temperatures persist
even in the summer, but this season brings
a rare gift: sunlight. For a brief period, it’s abundant, shining through the ice
for 24 hours a day. This infusion of energy drives intense
coastal phytoplankton blooms, transforming the waters
into a thick green soup. Marine life both large and small
takes advantage of this bounty, including the giant Antarctic isopod. Cousins of the humble pill bug, these crustaceans can reach
up to 11 centimeters long, and they never miss the opportunity
for a meal. The scavengers eat a wide variety of prey,
including other giant isopods. And by slowing their metabolisms,
they can make this food last, with one study showing specimens surviving
for 50 days without eating. Since this adaptation involves careful
conservation of energy, giant isopods spend most of their time
stationary or inching across the seafloor. Meanwhile, their tiny amphipod relatives
celebrate the summer by releasing offspring
alongside the algal explosion, ensuring their young have
an abundance of food. And sea cucumbers carpeting the seafloor
hoover up the dense plankton with outstretched
tentacles, producing nutrient-rich feces
that nourish nearby life. But this big summer blowout
doesn’t last long. The first signs of autumn arrive
in fine needles of frazil ice. These slowly coagulating crystals
form a skin across the surface, then mix with falling snow
before freezing into a thin crust of ice. The waters get darker and colder. And in this swiftly dimming world, a set of long, spiky limbs
sidle into view. With up to six pairs of legs,
these giant sea spiders aren’t arachnids, but rather a related class of marine
arthropod unique to the seafloor. In addition to housing some
of the animal’s organs, its legs are covered in tiny holes, which grow more numerous
as the spider ages. These holes will likely help absorb
the dissolved oxygen that saturates these freezing
southern waters. Since oxygen fuels growth, many local species have evolved
to take advantage of this abundance, and it may be one of the reasons that
gigantism is so common in this region. Individual sea spiders, for instance,
can grow to the size of dinner plates. But soon, these underwater giants
will be moving slower than ever. As winter settles in,
the sea floor becomes even colder. Waters fall to negative
1.8 degrees Celsius. On the surface, the thin icy crust
thickens into a layer called nilas, and young sea ice starts forming
ridges that block out the sun. The ocean begins to mirror
the still landscape above it. Antarctic sea cucumbers and urchins
go into dormancy for months, and their metabolic rates fall
to the slowest on Earth. Antarctic limpets continue feeding, but at such a gradual pace that they're
largely still surviving on energy reserves from the summer. Tiny crustaceans survive off the traces
of algae growing on their home’s icy ceiling, raising their young in these expansive
winter nurseries. But this seemingly endless winter
won't last forever. As spring comes, light slowly begins
to trickle back down through the ice. And week by week, bit by bit, this underwater world will begin waking up to begin its delicate,
slow-motion dance once again.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of invertebrates, while the generated MCQs are focused on specific aspects of the Antarctic ecosystem.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the concept of invertebrates, I would select Question 4: What is unique about the giant Antarctic isopod? This question is about a specific type of invertebrate, but it does not directly address the definition of invertebrates.

Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but with a low confidence level due to the significant difference in question intent and content.

**Transcript**:
The vast, white ice surface of Antarctica stretches for over 3 million
square kilometers: empty, desolate,
and almost completely silent. But appearances can be deceiving. On the coast of this expanse, just a few meters beneath the ice
lies a multicolored constellation of life. This remarkably diverse realm is home
to over 8,000 species of sea denizens who rely on an arsenal
of otherworldly traits to survive. So how do these species not only live,
but thrive, in conditions most animals
would be unable to bear? Antarctic waters are some of the most
consistently frigid in the world, hovering below 0 degrees Celsius
for a large portion of the year. This means burning energy
too quickly can be deadly, so survival in this ecosystem
looks slow and steady. Freezing temperatures persist
even in the summer, but this season brings
a rare gift: sunlight. For a brief period, it’s abundant, shining through the ice
for 24 hours a day. This infusion of energy drives intense
coastal phytoplankton blooms, transforming the waters
into a thick green soup. Marine life both large and small
takes advantage of this bounty, including the giant Antarctic isopod. Cousins of the humble pill bug, these crustaceans can reach
up to 11 centimeters long, and they never miss the opportunity
for a meal. The scavengers eat a wide variety of prey,
including other giant isopods. And by slowing their metabolisms,
they can make this food last, with one study showing specimens surviving
for 50 days without eating. Since this adaptation involves careful
conservation of energy, giant isopods spend most of their time
stationary or inching across the seafloor. Meanwhile, their tiny amphipod relatives
celebrate the summer by releasing offspring
alongside the algal explosion, ensuring their young have
an abundance of food. And sea cucumbers carpeting the seafloor
hoover up the dense plankton with outstretched
tentacles, producing nutrient-rich feces
that nourish nearby life. But this big summer blowout
doesn’t last long. The first signs of autumn arrive
in fine needles of frazil ice. These slowly coagulating crystals
form a skin across the surface, then mix with falling snow
before freezing into a thin crust of ice. The waters get darker and colder. And in this swiftly dimming world, a set of long, spiky limbs
sidle into view. With up to six pairs of legs,
these giant sea spiders aren’t arachnids, but rather a related class of marine
arthropod unique to the seafloor. In addition to housing some
of the animal’s organs, its legs are covered in tiny holes, which grow more numerous
as the spider ages. These holes will likely help absorb
the dissolved oxygen that saturates these freezing
southern waters. Since oxygen fuels growth, many local species have evolved
to take advantage of this abundance, and it may be one of the reasons that
gigantism is so common in this region. Individual sea spiders, for instance,
can grow to the size of dinner plates. But soon, these underwater giants
will be moving slower than ever. As winter settles in,
the sea floor becomes even colder. Waters fall to negative
1.8 degrees Celsius. On the surface, the thin icy crust
thickens into a layer called nilas, and young sea ice starts forming
ridges that block out the sun. The ocean begins to mirror
the still landscape above it. Antarctic sea cucumbers and urchins
go into dormancy for months, and their metabolic rates fall
to the slowest on Earth. Antarctic limpets continue feeding, but at such a gradual pace that they're
largely still surviving on energy reserves from the summer. Tiny crustaceans survive off the traces
of algae growing on their home’s icy ceiling, raising their young in these expansive
winter nurseries. But this seemingly endless winter
won't last forever. As spring comes, light slowly begins
to trickle back down through the ice. And week by week, bit by bit, this underwater world will begin waking up to begin its delicate,
slow-motion dance once again.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the season with 24 hours of daylight. According to the transcript, this occurs in the summer season. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the season with 24 hours of daylight, Question 5 mentions the role of phytoplankton blooms in the Antarctic ecosystem, which occurs during the summer season when sunlight is abundant.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the characteristics of the summer season in Antarctica. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the information provided, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to select one, I would choose Question 5, but with a note that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
You’re peering into the Amazon River
when, suddenly, you lose your footing and fall. Piranhas dart about in the rapidly
approaching water. So, are you doomed? Will your fall trigger
a fatal feeding frenzy? To forecast your fate, let’s see
what we know about these fish. There are more than 30 piranha species. All live in the fresh waters
of South America and have a single row of sharp,
interlocking teeth on each jaw. They use their teeth in a variety of ways. Many are omnivorous and supplement diets
of things like insects, crustaceans, worms, and fish with fruits, seeds,
and other plant matter. Some, like red-bellied piranhas,
both hunt and scavenge. And others, like wimple piranhas,
have specific dietary predilections, almost exclusively going
after other fish’s scales. Species like redeye piranhas
are more solitary, while red-bellied piranhas
form shoals of 10 to 100. Red-bellied piranhas are among
the most popularly depicted and commonly regarded
as especially aggressive. However, their reputation for rapacious
pack hunting is misinformed. It’s thought that the main benefit
of their group-living isn’t cooperative hunting but instead protection from predators,
of which they have many. Larger, mature red-bellied piranhas
tend to assume privileged positions at the shoal’s center,
where it’s safest. And scientists have observed that
red-bellied piranhas in smaller groups breathe faster, probably because they’re more anxious. Interestingly, they also communicate. By rapidly contracting specialized muscles
above their swim bladders, they repeatedly “bark” when they’re facing
off with one another or when captured. They make thudding noises when they’re
aggressively circling each other, fighting, or competing for food. And when things escalate further, they chase each other
while snapping their jaws together. Researchers suspect that these sounds are just a sampling
of their overall repertoire, which might also have
some special uses during mating. But when do red-bellied piranhas
get aggressive with humans? Well, when they do bite people, it seems to mostly happen in scenarios
when they’re being handled; when people are spilling food or
cleaning their fishing catch in the water; or when people disturb piranhas
while the fish are mating or guarding their eggs
during the wet season. Starvation stress is also thought
to lead red-bellied piranhas to increasingly bold, aggressive behavior. And this could theoretically result
in feeding frenzies where each fish tries to get some
of whatever finds its way into the water. Despite this kind of behavior
being extremely rare, rumors of it launched the piranha’s
international infamy. And this was in no small part thanks
to former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1914, he published a bestselling book
in which he called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world” and wrote that the scent of blood
could incite them to rapidly devour an entire cow—
or human— alive. But Roosevelt’s account is generally
considered circumstantial and misleading. The “feeding frenzy” he witnessed is
suspected to have been the result of people purposefully starving
red-bellied piranhas, then giving them the opportunity
to feed on a cow carcass— all to put on an exciting show. But where were we?
Ah, yes. Falling into piranha-infested waters. So, what’s your fate? Let’s assume these are
red-bellied piranhas. This being the Amazon River, they should be doing alright
for themselves and not starving. Thankfully, you’re also not hitting
the water alongside a bunch of fish guts. And ideally, you're not disrupting
a piranha breeding extravaganza. You fall in, and the piranhas
most likely avoid you. Calmly, softly swimming or wading to shore
is generally recommended because splashing is thought
to attract piranhas. Indeed, they’re equipped
with the dentition to do damage, but they rarely attack humans. They usually have better things to eat. As you make your way onto dry land, there is no feeding frenzy where they
skeletonize your body within minutes. And upon exiting the water, you're probably pleased to find
no chunks of flesh missing.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not contain a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that Question 3 has a numerical value in the options but it is not related to the number of piranha species.

But if I really had to choose I would say that the generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ is not present but the one that has a numerical value in the options is Question 3, however the index of this question is 3, keep in mind that this question is not similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest creating a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Here is an example:

Question: How many species of piranhas exist in nature?
Options: A. ~10, B. ~20, C. ~30, D. More than 30

This new MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

In summary, I was unable to find a match for the ground truth MCQ among the generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
You’re peering into the Amazon River
when, suddenly, you lose your footing and fall. Piranhas dart about in the rapidly
approaching water. So, are you doomed? Will your fall trigger
a fatal feeding frenzy? To forecast your fate, let’s see
what we know about these fish. There are more than 30 piranha species. All live in the fresh waters
of South America and have a single row of sharp,
interlocking teeth on each jaw. They use their teeth in a variety of ways. Many are omnivorous and supplement diets
of things like insects, crustaceans, worms, and fish with fruits, seeds,
and other plant matter. Some, like red-bellied piranhas,
both hunt and scavenge. And others, like wimple piranhas,
have specific dietary predilections, almost exclusively going
after other fish’s scales. Species like redeye piranhas
are more solitary, while red-bellied piranhas
form shoals of 10 to 100. Red-bellied piranhas are among
the most popularly depicted and commonly regarded
as especially aggressive. However, their reputation for rapacious
pack hunting is misinformed. It’s thought that the main benefit
of their group-living isn’t cooperative hunting but instead protection from predators,
of which they have many. Larger, mature red-bellied piranhas
tend to assume privileged positions at the shoal’s center,
where it’s safest. And scientists have observed that
red-bellied piranhas in smaller groups breathe faster, probably because they’re more anxious. Interestingly, they also communicate. By rapidly contracting specialized muscles
above their swim bladders, they repeatedly “bark” when they’re facing
off with one another or when captured. They make thudding noises when they’re
aggressively circling each other, fighting, or competing for food. And when things escalate further, they chase each other
while snapping their jaws together. Researchers suspect that these sounds are just a sampling
of their overall repertoire, which might also have
some special uses during mating. But when do red-bellied piranhas
get aggressive with humans? Well, when they do bite people, it seems to mostly happen in scenarios
when they’re being handled; when people are spilling food or
cleaning their fishing catch in the water; or when people disturb piranhas
while the fish are mating or guarding their eggs
during the wet season. Starvation stress is also thought
to lead red-bellied piranhas to increasingly bold, aggressive behavior. And this could theoretically result
in feeding frenzies where each fish tries to get some
of whatever finds its way into the water. Despite this kind of behavior
being extremely rare, rumors of it launched the piranha’s
international infamy. And this was in no small part thanks
to former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1914, he published a bestselling book
in which he called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world” and wrote that the scent of blood
could incite them to rapidly devour an entire cow—
or human— alive. But Roosevelt’s account is generally
considered circumstantial and misleading. The “feeding frenzy” he witnessed is
suspected to have been the result of people purposefully starving
red-bellied piranhas, then giving them the opportunity
to feed on a cow carcass— all to put on an exciting show. But where were we?
Ah, yes. Falling into piranha-infested waters. So, what’s your fate? Let’s assume these are
red-bellied piranhas. This being the Amazon River, they should be doing alright
for themselves and not starving. Thankfully, you’re also not hitting
the water alongside a bunch of fish guts. And ideally, you're not disrupting
a piranha breeding extravaganza. You fall in, and the piranhas
most likely avoid you. Calmly, softly swimming or wading to shore
is generally recommended because splashing is thought
to attract piranhas. Indeed, they’re equipped
with the dentition to do damage, but they rarely attack humans. They usually have better things to eat. As you make your way onto dry land, there is no feeding frenzy where they
skeletonize your body within minutes. And upon exiting the water, you're probably pleased to find
no chunks of flesh missing.

Ah, spring. As Demeter, goddess of the harvest,
it’s your favorite season. Humans and animals look to you to balance
the bounty of the natural world, which, like any self-respecting goddess,
you do with a pair of magical dice. Every day you roll the dice at dawn, and all lands that match the sum
of the two dice produce their resources. The resulting frequency of sums
across the season keeps your land in perfect harmony;
any other rates would spell ruin. And that’s why it was particularly rotten
when Loki, the Norse trickster god, invaded your land and cursed your dice,
causing all the dots to fall off. When you try to reaffix them, you find that one die won’t accept
more than four dots on any of its sides, though the other has no such constraint. You can use Hephaestus’ furnace to seal
the dots in place before the sun rises, but once sealed you can’t move
or remove them again. How can you craft your dice so that,
when rolled and summed, every total comes up with
the exact same frequency as it would with standard 6-sided dice? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Normal dice can roll any sum from 2 to 12, but sums in the middle tend to come
up more frequently than ones on the ends. We can see the odds of rolling any sum
by making a table, with all the possibilities for one die
represented on the top, and those for the other on the side. The table lets us see at a glance
that there are six ways to roll a 7, but only two ways to roll a 3. This also gives us an approach
to crafting our new set of dice. Matching the original sum frequencies
means that the locations of the sums in this table may change, but the numbers and quantities
of each sum must stay the same. In other words, there still must be
exactly one 2, two 3s, and so on. To start, we’ve got to roll that 2, and since we have to use
positive, whole numbers, there’s only one choice: 
each die needs a 1 on it. What else do we know? Assuming we have a 4— the highest
number possible— on the cursed die, the other one would need an 8
in order to have one way to roll 12. In fact, we know we require a single 1
and a single 4 on the cursed die, or we’d have too many ways
to roll a 2 or a 12. So the cursed dies remaining four sides
must have a mix of 2s and 3s. If we have three or four 2s, 
we can roll the sum 3 too many ways. Similarly, if we have three or four 3s,
we’d get the sum 11 too often. So the only possibility is for the
cursed die to have two 2s and two 3s. With one die completed, we should be able to figure out the
missing values on the second. First, we need one more way
to make 10 and 4, so we must have one 3 and one 6. We now need one more way
to make 5 and 9. That forces us to choose 4 and 5
for the final sides. Fill them in, and lo and behold, we have a distribution table where
every possible sum shows up the same number of times
as with our original dice! The discovery of these dice was made
in 1978 by George Sicherman, which is why they’re referred
to as “Sicherman dice.” Incredibly, this is the only alternate
way to make two 6-sided dice with the same distribution of sums
as standard dice. You send the dice to be reforged,
confident that you’ve averted disaster. Now it’s time to repay the Norse gods
with a gift of your own.

**Transcript**:
Ah, spring. As Demeter, goddess of the harvest,
it’s your favorite season. Humans and animals look to you to balance
the bounty of the natural world, which, like any self-respecting goddess,
you do with a pair of magical dice. Every day you roll the dice at dawn, and all lands that match the sum
of the two dice produce their resources. The resulting frequency of sums
across the season keeps your land in perfect harmony;
any other rates would spell ruin. And that’s why it was particularly rotten
when Loki, the Norse trickster god, invaded your land and cursed your dice,
causing all the dots to fall off. When you try to reaffix them, you find that one die won’t accept
more than four dots on any of its sides, though the other has no such constraint. You can use Hephaestus’ furnace to seal
the dots in place before the sun rises, but once sealed you can’t move
or remove them again. How can you craft your dice so that,
when rolled and summed, every total comes up with
the exact same frequency as it would with standard 6-sided dice? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Normal dice can roll any sum from 2 to 12, but sums in the middle tend to come
up more frequently than ones on the ends. We can see the odds of rolling any sum
by making a table, with all the possibilities for one die
represented on the top, and those for the other on the side. The table lets us see at a glance
that there are six ways to roll a 7, but only two ways to roll a 3. This also gives us an approach
to crafting our new set of dice. Matching the original sum frequencies
means that the locations of the sums in this table may change, but the numbers and quantities
of each sum must stay the same. In other words, there still must be
exactly one 2, two 3s, and so on. To start, we’ve got to roll that 2, and since we have to use
positive, whole numbers, there’s only one choice: 
each die needs a 1 on it. What else do we know? Assuming we have a 4— the highest
number possible— on the cursed die, the other one would need an 8
in order to have one way to roll 12. In fact, we know we require a single 1
and a single 4 on the cursed die, or we’d have too many ways
to roll a 2 or a 12. So the cursed dies remaining four sides
must have a mix of 2s and 3s. If we have three or four 2s, 
we can roll the sum 3 too many ways. Similarly, if we have three or four 3s,
we’d get the sum 11 too often. So the only possibility is for the
cursed die to have two 2s and two 3s. With one die completed, we should be able to figure out the
missing values on the second. First, we need one more way
to make 10 and 4, so we must have one 3 and one 6. We now need one more way
to make 5 and 9. That forces us to choose 4 and 5
for the final sides. Fill them in, and lo and behold, we have a distribution table where
every possible sum shows up the same number of times
as with our original dice! The discovery of these dice was made
in 1978 by George Sicherman, which is why they’re referred
to as “Sicherman dice.” Incredibly, this is the only alternate
way to make two 6-sided dice with the same distribution of sums
as standard dice. You send the dice to be reforged,
confident that you’ve averted disaster. Now it’s time to repay the Norse gods
with a gift of your own.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of distinct ways to roll an 11 with a pair of standard dice. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 mentions Demeter's approach to crafting her new set of dice, which involves making a table with all the possibilities for one die represented on the top, and those for the other on the side. This approach is related to understanding the distribution of sums, including the number of ways to roll a particular sum.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 9: What is the reason why Demeter needs to have a 4 on the cursed die?

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ because it discusses the configuration of the cursed die and the need for a 4 on it. However, it does not directly ask about the largest number on the face of the new, non-cursed die.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 9 is the most similar, but I would like to note that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
Since the launch of the first
artificial satellite in 1957, governments, companies,
and research institutions have been planting flags among the stars. But while it might seem like there's
plenty of room in this vast expanse, some pieces of celestial real estate
are more valuable than others. Each of these dots is a Lagrange point, and as far as human space exploration
is concerned, they may be the most important places
in our solar system. Named after the 18th century mathematician
who deduced their positions, Lagrange points are rare places
of equilibrium in our constantly shifting universe. All celestial bodies exert
a gravitational force on nearby objects, pulling them in and out of orbits. And gravity acts alongside several
apparent forces to determine what those orbits look like. However, Lagrange points are places
where all these forces balance out. So if we place a relatively
low mass object here, it will maintain a constant distance
from the massive bodies pulling on it. Essentially, Lagrange points are
celestial parking spaces— once an object is there, it requires
little to no energy to stay put. So whenever humans want to keep
an object in one place for a long time without using tons of fuel, it needs to be orbiting a Lagrange point. However, there are only so many
of these parking spots. Pairs of massive bodies
in our solar system generate sets of five Lagrange points. This means our Sun has
five points with every planet, and our planets have five points
with each of their moons. Adding these up, there are over 1,000
Lagrange points in our solar system— but only a few are useful
for human purposes. Many are in locations that are
too difficult to reach or simply not very useful. And for reasons we'll explain in a bit,
many others are unstable. Currently, only two of these points
are heavily used by humans. But we’ll likely use many
more in the future— making these limited points
exclusive real estate. Which begs the question:
what exactly should we park in them? That answer depends
on where each point is. Consider the five Lagrange points
generated by the Sun and the Earth. L1 is located inside Earth's orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers
away from the planet. With this panoramic view of the Sun,
unobstructed by Earth’s shadow, L1 is the perfect place
for solar-observing satellites. L2 is at the same distance from Earth
but outside its orbit and shielded from the Sun, making it the perfect spot
to observe outer space. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope
went online here, in a spot where the Sun and Earth
only occupy a tiny fraction of the sky. L3 is in a particularly
mysterious location that can never be directly observed
from Earth’s surface. This has made L3 a frequent locale
in science fiction, though it hasn’t offered much use
to scientists yet. L4 and L5, however, are a bit different
from their siblings. In every set of five, the first three
Lagrange points are slightly unstable. This means objects will slowly drift
away from them, though keeping what we’ve parked there
in place is still energetically cheap. The stability of L4 and L5, however,
varies from set to set. If the heavier of the two bodies
generating the points has less than 25 times the mass
of the lighter body, these points are too unstable
to park things in. However, if the heavier body is massive
enough— like it is in Sun-Earth set— then the relevant forces will always
return objects to these equilibrium points, making them our most stable parking spots. That’s why points like these
naturally accumulate space objects, such as the Sun-Jupiter set’s L4 and L5,
which host thousands of asteroids. Every Lagrange point in our solar system
has its quirks. Some might be perfect for scavenging
construction materials from drifting asteroids. Others might make ideal gas stations
for ships headed to deep space, or even host entire human colonies. These points are already home
to advanced technological achievements, but soon, they could become
our stepping stones to the stars.

**Transcript**:
Since the launch of the first
artificial satellite in 1957, governments, companies,
and research institutions have been planting flags among the stars. But while it might seem like there's
plenty of room in this vast expanse, some pieces of celestial real estate
are more valuable than others. Each of these dots is a Lagrange point, and as far as human space exploration
is concerned, they may be the most important places
in our solar system. Named after the 18th century mathematician
who deduced their positions, Lagrange points are rare places
of equilibrium in our constantly shifting universe. All celestial bodies exert
a gravitational force on nearby objects, pulling them in and out of orbits. And gravity acts alongside several
apparent forces to determine what those orbits look like. However, Lagrange points are places
where all these forces balance out. So if we place a relatively
low mass object here, it will maintain a constant distance
from the massive bodies pulling on it. Essentially, Lagrange points are
celestial parking spaces— once an object is there, it requires
little to no energy to stay put. So whenever humans want to keep
an object in one place for a long time without using tons of fuel, it needs to be orbiting a Lagrange point. However, there are only so many
of these parking spots. Pairs of massive bodies
in our solar system generate sets of five Lagrange points. This means our Sun has
five points with every planet, and our planets have five points
with each of their moons. Adding these up, there are over 1,000
Lagrange points in our solar system— but only a few are useful
for human purposes. Many are in locations that are
too difficult to reach or simply not very useful. And for reasons we'll explain in a bit,
many others are unstable. Currently, only two of these points
are heavily used by humans. But we’ll likely use many
more in the future— making these limited points
exclusive real estate. Which begs the question:
what exactly should we park in them? That answer depends
on where each point is. Consider the five Lagrange points
generated by the Sun and the Earth. L1 is located inside Earth's orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers
away from the planet. With this panoramic view of the Sun,
unobstructed by Earth’s shadow, L1 is the perfect place
for solar-observing satellites. L2 is at the same distance from Earth
but outside its orbit and shielded from the Sun, making it the perfect spot
to observe outer space. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope
went online here, in a spot where the Sun and Earth
only occupy a tiny fraction of the sky. L3 is in a particularly
mysterious location that can never be directly observed
from Earth’s surface. This has made L3 a frequent locale
in science fiction, though it hasn’t offered much use
to scientists yet. L4 and L5, however, are a bit different
from their siblings. In every set of five, the first three
Lagrange points are slightly unstable. This means objects will slowly drift
away from them, though keeping what we’ve parked there
in place is still energetically cheap. The stability of L4 and L5, however,
varies from set to set. If the heavier of the two bodies
generating the points has less than 25 times the mass
of the lighter body, these points are too unstable
to park things in. However, if the heavier body is massive
enough— like it is in Sun-Earth set— then the relevant forces will always
return objects to these equilibrium points, making them our most stable parking spots. That’s why points like these
naturally accumulate space objects, such as the Sun-Jupiter set’s L4 and L5,
which host thousands of asteroids. Every Lagrange point in our solar system
has its quirks. Some might be perfect for scavenging
construction materials from drifting asteroids. Others might make ideal gas stations
for ships headed to deep space, or even host entire human colonies. These points are already home
to advanced technological achievements, but soon, they could become
our stepping stones to the stars.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options provided do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

A more accurate match is not available among the provided generated MCQs, but Question 2 addresses the concept of Lagrange points being "celestial parking spaces," which relates to the idea of objects maintaining a stable distance from the Sun and the planet.

However, if I had to choose a question that closely matches the content, I would say Question 1, because it talks about the balance of gravitational forces, which is a key concept in Lagrange points.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 1 as the closest match, with the caveat that the options provided do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Right now, invisible signals are flying
through the air all around you. Beyond the spectrum of light
your eyes can see, massive radio waves as wide as houses carry information between computers,
GPS systems, cell phones, and more. In fact, the signal your phone broadcasts
is so strong, if your eyes could see radio waves, your phone would be visible from Jupiter. At least your special eyes would be able
to see this if the sky wasn’t flooded with interference
from routers, satellites, and, of course, people flying who haven't put their
phones on airplane mode. You see, this setting isn't
to protect your flight, it's to protect everyone else
in your flight path. Cell phones connect to networks
by emitting information in the form of electromagnetic waves; specifically, radio waves, which occupy this band of the
electromagnetic spectrum. These radio waves come
in a range of wavelengths, and let’s imagine your special eyes
see the various wavelengths as different colors. When you make a call,
your phone generates a radio wave signal which it throws to the nearest cell tower. If you're far from service, your phone will expend more battery power
to send a higher amplitude signal in an effort to make a connection. Once connected, this signal is relayed
between cell towers all the way to your call’s recipient. Since your call isn’t the only
signal out here, cell towers managing the calls assign
each phones involved their own wavelength. This specific color ensures you’re not
picking up other people’s calls. It’s even slightly different
from the wavelength your phone is receiving information on, so as not to interfere
with that incoming signal. But there are only so many
colors to choose from. And since the advent of Wi-Fi, the demand for ownership of these
wavelengths has increased dramatically. With all these signals in the air and
a limited number of colors to assign, avoiding interference is
increasingly difficult. Especially when cell towers receive
too many signals at once, such as during regional emergencies, when
everyone's trying to use their phones. But other sources of interference
are more preventable, like phones searching for signals
from thousands of meters in the sky. Phones on planes are very
far from cell towers, so they work overtime to send
the loudest signals they can in search of service. But since planes travel so quickly, the phones might find themselves much
closer to a cell tower than expected— blasting it with a massive signal
that drowns out those on the ground. So when you fly without
using airplane mode, you’re essentially acting
as a military radio jammer— sending out giant radio waves 
that interfere with nearby signals. Even on the ground, almost all our
electronics emit rogue radio waves, slowing down our internet
and making our calls choppy. This leads consumers to pay
for more bandwidth, pushing service providers to take
over more of the radio spectrum, and eventually, send more satellites
into the sky— creating a vicious cycle that could
eventually blot out the stars. Though, even without these satellites, this system is threatening
our relationship with the cosmos. Radio telescopes used for astronomy rely on a specific band of wavelengths
to see deep into space. However, while this range
is supposedly protected, the cutoffs aren’t enforced. For example, the Very Large Array can see
signals throughout our solar system from 1 to 50 GHz. But if it tries looking for signals
below 5 GHz, its search could be drowned
out by a sea of phones on 5G networks. Today, nowhere on Earth
is truly radio quiet. Satellites relaying signals
around the globe have blanketed the planet in radio waves. But there are a few places
with less crowded skies, where radio telescopes
can look deep into space. Here, we can see the black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, and uncover the secrets of galaxies
up to 96 billion light years away. Well, so long as we’re
not blinded by phones sending signals from first class.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the frequency range at which most household appliances and cell phones operate. While none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific topic, Question 4 mentions the "limited number of wavelengths available" which is related to the frequency spectrum.

However, a more relevant question is Question 8, which talks about the impact of radio waves on radio telescopes used for astronomy and mentions a specific frequency range (1 to 50 GHz and below 5 GHz).

But the most relevant question is Question 5, which mentions the 5G networks and their interference, and this is somewhat related to the frequency range.

So, the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 5, but with a big caveat that it is not a very similar question.

However, I must note that the correct answer is actually mentioned in the transcript: "the Very Large Array can see signals throughout our solar system from 1 to 50 GHz. But if it tries looking for signals below 5 GHz, its search could be drowned out by a sea of phones on 5G networks."

So, if I really had to choose one, I would say Question 5 is the most similar, but I am not confident in this answer.

**Transcript**:
Right now, invisible signals are flying
through the air all around you. Beyond the spectrum of light
your eyes can see, massive radio waves as wide as houses carry information between computers,
GPS systems, cell phones, and more. In fact, the signal your phone broadcasts
is so strong, if your eyes could see radio waves, your phone would be visible from Jupiter. At least your special eyes would be able
to see this if the sky wasn’t flooded with interference
from routers, satellites, and, of course, people flying who haven't put their
phones on airplane mode. You see, this setting isn't
to protect your flight, it's to protect everyone else
in your flight path. Cell phones connect to networks
by emitting information in the form of electromagnetic waves; specifically, radio waves, which occupy this band of the
electromagnetic spectrum. These radio waves come
in a range of wavelengths, and let’s imagine your special eyes
see the various wavelengths as different colors. When you make a call,
your phone generates a radio wave signal which it throws to the nearest cell tower. If you're far from service, your phone will expend more battery power
to send a higher amplitude signal in an effort to make a connection. Once connected, this signal is relayed
between cell towers all the way to your call’s recipient. Since your call isn’t the only
signal out here, cell towers managing the calls assign
each phones involved their own wavelength. This specific color ensures you’re not
picking up other people’s calls. It’s even slightly different
from the wavelength your phone is receiving information on, so as not to interfere
with that incoming signal. But there are only so many
colors to choose from. And since the advent of Wi-Fi, the demand for ownership of these
wavelengths has increased dramatically. With all these signals in the air and
a limited number of colors to assign, avoiding interference is
increasingly difficult. Especially when cell towers receive
too many signals at once, such as during regional emergencies, when
everyone's trying to use their phones. But other sources of interference
are more preventable, like phones searching for signals
from thousands of meters in the sky. Phones on planes are very
far from cell towers, so they work overtime to send
the loudest signals they can in search of service. But since planes travel so quickly, the phones might find themselves much
closer to a cell tower than expected— blasting it with a massive signal
that drowns out those on the ground. So when you fly without
using airplane mode, you’re essentially acting
as a military radio jammer— sending out giant radio waves 
that interfere with nearby signals. Even on the ground, almost all our
electronics emit rogue radio waves, slowing down our internet
and making our calls choppy. This leads consumers to pay
for more bandwidth, pushing service providers to take
over more of the radio spectrum, and eventually, send more satellites
into the sky— creating a vicious cycle that could
eventually blot out the stars. Though, even without these satellites, this system is threatening
our relationship with the cosmos. Radio telescopes used for astronomy rely on a specific band of wavelengths
to see deep into space. However, while this range
is supposedly protected, the cutoffs aren’t enforced. For example, the Very Large Array can see
signals throughout our solar system from 1 to 50 GHz. But if it tries looking for signals
below 5 GHz, its search could be drowned
out by a sea of phones on 5G networks. Today, nowhere on Earth
is truly radio quiet. Satellites relaying signals
around the globe have blanketed the planet in radio waves. But there are a few places
with less crowded skies, where radio telescopes
can look deep into space. Here, we can see the black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, and uncover the secrets of galaxies
up to 96 billion light years away. Well, so long as we’re
not blinded by phones sending signals from first class.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly asking about the type of wave a radio wave is. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic.

Generated MCQ 1 is the closest match, as it mentions radio waves as a type of signal flying through the air and carrying information between devices. Although it does not directly ask about the type of wave a radio wave is, it does provide some information about radio waves.

However, please note that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Generated MCQ 1 is the closest match, but it's not a perfect match.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A drop of gasoline, a match,
and a battery, all store energy— but, after each expends its energy,
only the battery is recyclable. That's because, chemically speaking, a dead battery is actually not
that different from a fresh one. Most of the batteries we use
today take advantage of the fact that some metals like
to release electrons and others like to accept them. For example, in a typical
alkaline double-A battery, zinc metal reacts with hydroxide ions, changing into zinc oxide and releasing
electrons at the negative terminal. The electrons travel through, say,
a light bulb, and then return to the battery
at the positive terminal, where they’re accepted
by manganese dioxide. Different batteries use different
combinations of metals, and sometimes non-metals like graphite, but the basic idea is to use
a pair of chemical reactions to generate a stream of electrons. Almost all batteries,
even single-use batteries, are theoretically rechargeable. That's because the metals and other
chemicals are still right there. That’s very different than in,
say, gasoline, where the liquid hydrocarbon molecules
are converted to gases. You can't convert exhaust
back into gasoline, but, with some work you can convert,
say, zinc oxide back to zinc. So then what's the difference
between these and these? The short answer is that trying
to recharge a single-use battery doesn’t just force these reactions
to run in reverse. It also results in a bunch of side
reactions that produce useless contaminants, reducing a battery’s capacity; and it could even damage
the internal structure of the battery, leading to a loss of electrical contact
and failure. Rechargeable batteries are engineered
to avoid these issues. Look at this lithium-ion battery. Both sides have an atomic-level structure
that you can imagine as lots of docks. So when the battery is powering something, the lithium “ships” give up their
electrons to power the circuit, and then sail over to the other side
of the battery, dock in an orderly, organized way, and meet up with their
now-lower-energy electrons. When the battery is being charged,
the opposite happens. Over the course of hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of charge cycles, some of the lithium ion ships
sort of veer off course and engage in side reactions, producing stuff that increases
the internal resistance of the battery, which in turn makes it lose
efficiency and power until it inevitably dies. Even when that happens,
you can bring dead batteries back to life— whether they’re rechargeable or not—
by recycling them. The heart of most battery recycling
is a process called smelting, which is basically just melting
the metallic parts. This drives off impurities, returning metals back to their
initial, orderly state. Unfortunately, in many countries you can’t
just toss household batteries in with your regular recycling. You have to take them to a battery
collection point or recycling center. Same goes for more complicated
rechargeable batteries: you need to bring them
to a collection point or send them back to the company
you bought them from. It’s a pain, but absolutely
worth the time and effort, because recycling batteries is critical. Not only does it prevent
potentially toxic battery metals from leaking into the environment, it conserves scarce— and vital— resources. Earth has about 22 million tons
of lithium— enough for about 2.5 billion EVs. That sounds like plenty, but it’s only
25% higher than the number of EVs experts believe it’ll take to reach
net zero emissions by 2050, and that doesn’t even account for laptops,
phones, and anything else that uses a lithium-ion battery. Currently, though, most lithium-ion
batteries are not manufactured with recycling in mind. The designs are intricate
and non-standard, and the components are held together
by almost indestructible glues. So today, less than 5% of lithium-ion
batteries are recycled. Regulations that clearly define
who is responsible for a spent battery and what should happen to it
can boost recycling dramatically. For example, lead-acid batteries are
generally subject to stringent regulations and are recycled at much higher rates
than lithium-ion batteries. Over the next century, we’ll need
to recycle huge numbers of EV batteries, so scientists are working on making
the battery recycling process cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Smelting uses a lot of energy and,
depending on the type of battery, can release harmful by-products. In addition to regulations, industrial
processes, and our own individual choices, battery tech will also continue to evolve. There are proof-of-concept batteries
being developed that can convert physical force, ambient sound,
and even pee into electricity. But if your top priority is to make your
number one source of power, number one, sorry to say, but urine for a long wait.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, a more accurate match can be found by looking at the options and the content of the generated MCQs. Question 3 mentions that "single-use batteries are not typically rechargeable in practice" and one of the options (D) states "Because it is not theoretically possible to recharge single-use batteries." This option is related to the ground truth MCQ, which states "Most batteries, even 'single-use' ones, are theoretically recyclable."

Considering the options and the content, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not exactly the same as the ground truth MCQ, but it is related to Question 3.

But if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ based on the question intent, I would say it is:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs are related to the transcript, but they do not match the specific question and options of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but it is still not a match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the amount of lithium available on Earth and the number of electric vehicles it can support, whereas Question 7 asks about the current rate of lithium-ion battery recycling.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you insist on getting an index, I would say that the index is "None" or "Not Available" since there is no matching generated MCQ.

If you want to generate a new set of MCQs that includes a match for the ground truth MCQ, I can help you with that.

**Transcript**:
A drop of gasoline, a match,
and a battery, all store energy— but, after each expends its energy,
only the battery is recyclable. That's because, chemically speaking, a dead battery is actually not
that different from a fresh one. Most of the batteries we use
today take advantage of the fact that some metals like
to release electrons and others like to accept them. For example, in a typical
alkaline double-A battery, zinc metal reacts with hydroxide ions, changing into zinc oxide and releasing
electrons at the negative terminal. The electrons travel through, say,
a light bulb, and then return to the battery
at the positive terminal, where they’re accepted
by manganese dioxide. Different batteries use different
combinations of metals, and sometimes non-metals like graphite, but the basic idea is to use
a pair of chemical reactions to generate a stream of electrons. Almost all batteries,
even single-use batteries, are theoretically rechargeable. That's because the metals and other
chemicals are still right there. That’s very different than in,
say, gasoline, where the liquid hydrocarbon molecules
are converted to gases. You can't convert exhaust
back into gasoline, but, with some work you can convert,
say, zinc oxide back to zinc. So then what's the difference
between these and these? The short answer is that trying
to recharge a single-use battery doesn’t just force these reactions
to run in reverse. It also results in a bunch of side
reactions that produce useless contaminants, reducing a battery’s capacity; and it could even damage
the internal structure of the battery, leading to a loss of electrical contact
and failure. Rechargeable batteries are engineered
to avoid these issues. Look at this lithium-ion battery. Both sides have an atomic-level structure
that you can imagine as lots of docks. So when the battery is powering something, the lithium “ships” give up their
electrons to power the circuit, and then sail over to the other side
of the battery, dock in an orderly, organized way, and meet up with their
now-lower-energy electrons. When the battery is being charged,
the opposite happens. Over the course of hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of charge cycles, some of the lithium ion ships
sort of veer off course and engage in side reactions, producing stuff that increases
the internal resistance of the battery, which in turn makes it lose
efficiency and power until it inevitably dies. Even when that happens,
you can bring dead batteries back to life— whether they’re rechargeable or not—
by recycling them. The heart of most battery recycling
is a process called smelting, which is basically just melting
the metallic parts. This drives off impurities, returning metals back to their
initial, orderly state. Unfortunately, in many countries you can’t
just toss household batteries in with your regular recycling. You have to take them to a battery
collection point or recycling center. Same goes for more complicated
rechargeable batteries: you need to bring them
to a collection point or send them back to the company
you bought them from. It’s a pain, but absolutely
worth the time and effort, because recycling batteries is critical. Not only does it prevent
potentially toxic battery metals from leaking into the environment, it conserves scarce— and vital— resources. Earth has about 22 million tons
of lithium— enough for about 2.5 billion EVs. That sounds like plenty, but it’s only
25% higher than the number of EVs experts believe it’ll take to reach
net zero emissions by 2050, and that doesn’t even account for laptops,
phones, and anything else that uses a lithium-ion battery. Currently, though, most lithium-ion
batteries are not manufactured with recycling in mind. The designs are intricate
and non-standard, and the components are held together
by almost indestructible glues. So today, less than 5% of lithium-ion
batteries are recycled. Regulations that clearly define
who is responsible for a spent battery and what should happen to it
can boost recycling dramatically. For example, lead-acid batteries are
generally subject to stringent regulations and are recycled at much higher rates
than lithium-ion batteries. Over the next century, we’ll need
to recycle huge numbers of EV batteries, so scientists are working on making
the battery recycling process cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Smelting uses a lot of energy and,
depending on the type of battery, can release harmful by-products. In addition to regulations, industrial
processes, and our own individual choices, battery tech will also continue to evolve. There are proof-of-concept batteries
being developed that can convert physical force, ambient sound,
and even pee into electricity. But if your top priority is to make your
number one source of power, number one, sorry to say, but urine for a long wait.

**Transcript**:
10th century jester Jing Xinmo may have overstepped
when he got chased by a dog, then teasingly told the Chinese emperor that he shouldn’t let his kids
go around biting people. The emperor took offense
and trained an arrow on Jing. But instead of begging for his life,
Jing cracked another joke. Luckily, this pun landed—
so the emperor’s arrow did not. Contrary to common belief, jesters weren't just a medieval
European phenomenon, but flourished 
in other times and cultures. The first reliably recorded jester
is thought to be You Shi, of 7th century BCE China. He declared that, as a jester,
his words could not give offense. This privilege was important
to the jester’s position— but was sometimes violated. Jesters had unique relationships to power: they could be viewed as objects of mockery and also as entertainers
and trusted companions. People became jesters by various routes. They could be appointed due to physical
or neurological differences, plucked from a pool of entertainers,
or recruited by a traveling courtier. Such was the case when a royal servant wrote King Henry VIII’s chief minister
in the 1530s. He recommended a young boy to replace
the king’s aging jester, Sexten, with the assurance that he’d be much more
pleasant than Sexten ever was. Some jesters boasted unique talents,
like Roland the Farter, of Henry II’s 12th Century court. Every Christmas,
he performed a special routine, the finale of which was
a simultaneous jump, whistle, and fart. Additionally, jesters could influence
important decisions. For example,
if the clowns of the Tübatulabal nation of the Sierra Nevada mountains thought a chief was leading poorly, they could apparently
get the elders to appoint a new one. And, of course, Jing Xinmo knew
how to sway the Chinese emperor. A local magistrate once requested
that the emperor stop trampling farmland during his hunting sprees. Infuriated, the emperor
had the magistrate hauled before him. Jing facetiously suggested that
the magistrate be put to death immediately and that the emperor
let the peasants starve instead of harvesting the land
and paying taxes, all so he could gallop about freely. Presumably seeing the absurdity
of his own behavior, the emperor laughed 
and pardoned the magistrate. In 1596, a French man
was condemned to death. But Mathurine, one of the relatively few
female jesters on record, intervened in return for payment. With her help, the man’s wife
successfully pleaded with King Henry IV for her husband’s life. Although rare, jesters were
sometimes fired or even killed for taking their mockery or criticism
too far. In 1638, Scottish jester Archy Armstrong worsened his already
contentious relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop had recently revised
the Scottish Book of Common Prayer— an act that garnered strong opposition
and incited riots. Taking the opportunity
to further humiliate him, Archy asked the Archbishop,
“Who’s the fool now?” For which he was banished from the court. Three years later,
after the Archbishop’s arrest, a pamphlet began circulating
that ridiculed him, which was said to be the work
of none other than Archy. Meanwhile, some jesters openly mocked
their royal bosses without consequence. 11th century Persian jester Talhak
suggested the sultan was a cuckold, implying his wife was unfaithful to him. One day, as the sultan rested
his head on Talhak’s knee, he is said to have inquired,
“What is your relation to cuckolds?” To which Talhak replied,
“I am their pillow.” And when 19th century Persian shah asked
whether there was a food shortage, jester Karim Shir’ei joked, “Yes, I see Your Majesty is eating
only five times a day.” Even when rulers were considered
divinely appointed, some jesters managed to speak truth
directly to power, and reveal— in so many riddles,
jokes, or skits— who the real fools were.

suggested the sultan was a cuckold, implying his wife was unfaithful to him. One day, as the sultan rested
his head on Talhak’s knee, he is said to have inquired,
“What is your relation to cuckolds?” To which Talhak replied,
“I am their pillow.” And when 19th century Persian shah asked
whether there was a food shortage, jester Karim Shir’ei joked, “Yes, I see Your Majesty is eating
only five times a day.” Even when rulers were considered
divinely appointed, some jesters managed to speak truth
directly to power, and reveal— in so many riddles,

**Transcript**:
10th century jester Jing Xinmo may have overstepped
when he got chased by a dog, then teasingly told the Chinese emperor that he shouldn’t let his kids
go around biting people. The emperor took offense
and trained an arrow on Jing. But instead of begging for his life,
Jing cracked another joke. Luckily, this pun landed—
so the emperor’s arrow did not. Contrary to common belief, jesters weren't just a medieval
European phenomenon, but flourished 
in other times and cultures. The first reliably recorded jester
is thought to be You Shi, of 7th century BCE China. He declared that, as a jester,
his words could not give offense. This privilege was important
to the jester’s position— but was sometimes violated. Jesters had unique relationships to power: they could be viewed as objects of mockery and also as entertainers
and trusted companions. People became jesters by various routes. They could be appointed due to physical
or neurological differences, plucked from a pool of entertainers,
or recruited by a traveling courtier. Such was the case when a royal servant wrote King Henry VIII’s chief minister
in the 1530s. He recommended a young boy to replace
the king’s aging jester, Sexten, with the assurance that he’d be much more
pleasant than Sexten ever was. Some jesters boasted unique talents,
like Roland the Farter, of Henry II’s 12th Century court. Every Christmas,
he performed a special routine, the finale of which was
a simultaneous jump, whistle, and fart. Additionally, jesters could influence
important decisions. For example,
if the clowns of the Tübatulabal nation of the Sierra Nevada mountains thought a chief was leading poorly, they could apparently
get the elders to appoint a new one. And, of course, Jing Xinmo knew
how to sway the Chinese emperor. A local magistrate once requested
that the emperor stop trampling farmland during his hunting sprees. Infuriated, the emperor
had the magistrate hauled before him. Jing facetiously suggested that
the magistrate be put to death immediately and that the emperor
let the peasants starve instead of harvesting the land
and paying taxes, all so he could gallop about freely. Presumably seeing the absurdity
of his own behavior, the emperor laughed 
and pardoned the magistrate. In 1596, a French man
was condemned to death. But Mathurine, one of the relatively few
female jesters on record, intervened in return for payment. With her help, the man’s wife
successfully pleaded with King Henry IV for her husband’s life. Although rare, jesters were
sometimes fired or even killed for taking their mockery or criticism
too far. In 1638, Scottish jester Archy Armstrong worsened his already
contentious relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop had recently revised
the Scottish Book of Common Prayer— an act that garnered strong opposition
and incited riots. Taking the opportunity
to further humiliate him, Archy asked the Archbishop,
“Who’s the fool now?” For which he was banished from the court. Three years later,
after the Archbishop’s arrest, a pamphlet began circulating
that ridiculed him, which was said to be the work
of none other than Archy. Meanwhile, some jesters openly mocked
their royal bosses without consequence. 11th century Persian jester Talhak
suggested the sultan was a cuckold, implying his wife was unfaithful to him. One day, as the sultan rested

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We talk about inventions and innovation as though the best things out there are the Internet, iPads, or smart phones. Or perhaps more simply, trains, planes, and automobiles. Which one is most important, the best, or the greatest? Which one has had the most impact on society? Today the debate would probably be in favor of computer technology, but is it? Well, some would say, "Nope, not really, it's farming." Where would we be if we didn't have it? Give up? We would still be hunting and gathering with little time to invent anything, let alone the Internet. That's right, farming is the seed of civilization. Not quite literally, but without early man's discovery of using seeds to grow grain, we wouldn't have much of anything we have today. Growing your own food changed everything. Sure, hunting and gathering worked just fine for tens of thousands of years, but you couldn't do much else - no time. But when hunters and gatherers started planting seeds, they began to farm. With farming came animals, and with animals came settling down and staying in one location. So, how does this have anything to do with invention and innovation? Everything. Anyone who's ever farmed, even if it's planting a half dozen tomato plants in your backyard, knows that you usually harvest way more than you could possibly eat, a surplus. Farming yielded plenty of food, with enough to store, trade, and eat. In other words, not everyone needed to be farmers. Therefore, this allowed other people, non-farmers, to do other things such as make tools, craft pottery, and build homes. Farming and food surpluses led to the division of labor. This is still thousands of years ago, so life wasn't easy. But with so many people contributing to the community, small villages began to develop. As the population of villages expanded, so did the needs of the people. Things got complicated. But, civilization is just that - advanced, complex societies. And without farming, they would not exist. Villages increased in size, eventually becoming the first cities. Cities are just one of the basic features of a civilization, the others include central government, system of writing, organized religion, art and architecture, urban planning of roads, bridges, and public works, social classes, and different jobs. Developing expertise in various types of occupations allowed for innovative ways of doing things, producing new products, or making advancements in technology. As civilizations became more complex, new ways of doing things were needed. Some were out of necessity. Others because people had ideas. The sharing of ideas and technology led to the growth of things we readily use today, like the Internet. So without farming, we'd still be hunting and gathering. No video, no computers, and certainly no world wide web.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We talk about inventions and innovation as though the best things out there are the Internet, iPads, or smart phones. Or perhaps more simply, trains, planes, and automobiles. Which one is most important, the best, or the greatest? Which one has had the most impact on society? Today the debate would probably be in favor of computer technology, but is it? Well, some would say, "Nope, not really, it's farming." Where would we be if we didn't have it? Give up? We would still be hunting and gathering with little time to invent anything, let alone the Internet. That's right, farming is the seed of civilization. Not quite literally, but without early man's discovery of using seeds to grow grain, we wouldn't have much of anything we have today. Growing your own food changed everything. Sure, hunting and gathering worked just fine for tens of thousands of years, but you couldn't do much else - no time. But when hunters and gatherers started planting seeds, they began to farm. With farming came animals, and with animals came settling down and staying in one location. So, how does this have anything to do with invention and innovation? Everything. Anyone who's ever farmed, even if it's planting a half dozen tomato plants in your backyard, knows that you usually harvest way more than you could possibly eat, a surplus. Farming yielded plenty of food, with enough to store, trade, and eat. In other words, not everyone needed to be farmers. Therefore, this allowed other people, non-farmers, to do other things such as make tools, craft pottery, and build homes. Farming and food surpluses led to the division of labor. This is still thousands of years ago, so life wasn't easy. But with so many people contributing to the community, small villages began to develop. As the population of villages expanded, so did the needs of the people. Things got complicated. But, civilization is just that - advanced, complex societies. And without farming, they would not exist. Villages increased in size, eventually becoming the first cities. Cities are just one of the basic features of a civilization, the others include central government, system of writing, organized religion, art and architecture, urban planning of roads, bridges, and public works, social classes, and different jobs. Developing expertise in various types of occupations allowed for innovative ways of doing things, producing new products, or making advancements in technology. As civilizations became more complex, new ways of doing things were needed. Some were out of necessity. Others because people had ideas. The sharing of ideas and technology led to the growth of things we readily use today, like the Internet. So without farming, we'd still be hunting and gathering. No video, no computers, and certainly no world wide web.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of the Boston Tea Party, something about a bunch of angry colonists dressed as Native Americans throwing chests of tea into the water. But the story is far more complicated, filled with imperial intrigue, corporate crisis, smuggling, and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution. The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's is that it was really, really popular. In England, each man, woman, and child consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year. And, since the English colonized America, Americans were crazy about tea too. By the 1760's, they were drinking over a million pounds of tea every year. So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes on tea in America, people were not happy, mostly because they had no say in tax decisions made in London. Remember that famous phrase, "No taxation without representation"? The American colonists had long believed that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature in which they lacked representation. In fact, rather than paying the taxes, they simply dodged the tax collectors. Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long and British enforcement was lax, about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking was smuggled in, usually from Holland. But the British insisted that Parliament did have the authority to tax the colonists, especially after Britain went deeply into debt fighting the French in the Seven Years' War. To close the budget gap, London looked to Americans, and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports, including the American's beloved tea. America's response: no thanks! They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain, and instead, brewed their own. After a new bunch of British customs commissioners cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement, things got so heated that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston, killing several people, in what was soon called the Boston Massacre. Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act, Parliament cooked up a new strategy. Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea directly through hand-picked consignees in America. This would lower the price to consumers, making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety while retaining some of the taxes. But the colonists saw through the British ploy and cried, "Monopoly!" Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773. About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded into the Old South Meeting House, waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea that have arrived down the harbor will be unloaded for sale. When the captain of one of those ships reported that he could not leave with his cargo on board, Sam Adams rose to shout, "This meeting can do no more to save the country!" Cries of "Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!" rang out from the crowd, and about 50 men, some apparently dressed as Native Americans, marched down to Griffin's Wharf, stormed aboard three ships, and threw 340 tea chests overboard. An infuriated British government responsded with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774, which, among other things, closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated the East India Company for the tea. That never happened. Representatives of the colonies gathered at Philadelphia to consider how best to respond to continued British oppression. This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea, pledged to support a continued boycott, and went home in late October 1774 even more united in their determination to protect their rights and liberties. The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction that led with little pause to the Declaration of Independence and a bloody rebellion, after which the new nation was free to drink its tea, more or less, in peace.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why did Parliament impose new taxes on the American colonists after the mid-1700s?
Options: A. British officials wanted revenue to purchase land in North America from France, B. British officials wanted to punish the colonists for leaving England, C. The colonists had willingly paid taxes imposed by Parliament in the past, D. The British owed money to Bulgaria and Spain

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar You've probably heard of the Boston Tea Party, something about a bunch of angry colonists dressed as Native Americans throwing chests of tea into the water. But the story is far more complicated, filled with imperial intrigue, corporate crisis, smuggling, and the grassroots origins of the American Revolution. The first thing you need to know about tea in the 1700's is that it was really, really popular. In England, each man, woman, and child consumed almost 300 cups of this stuff every year. And, since the English colonized America, Americans were crazy about tea too. By the 1760's, they were drinking over a million pounds of tea every year. So, when Britain wanted to increase taxes on tea in America, people were not happy, mostly because they had no say in tax decisions made in London. Remember that famous phrase, "No taxation without representation"? The American colonists had long believed that they were not subject to taxes imposed by legislature in which they lacked representation. In fact, rather than paying the taxes, they simply dodged the tax collectors. Since the east coast of America is hundreds of miles long and British enforcement was lax, about 3/4 of the tea Americans were drinking was smuggled in, usually from Holland. But the British insisted that Parliament did have the authority to tax the colonists, especially after Britain went deeply into debt fighting the French in the Seven Years' War. To close the budget gap, London looked to Americans, and in 1767 imposed new taxes on a variety of imports, including the American's beloved tea. America's response: no thanks! They boycotted the importation of tea from Britain, and instead, brewed their own. After a new bunch of British customs commissioners cried to London for troops to help with tax enforcement, things got so heated that the Red Coats fired on a mob in Boston, killing several people, in what was soon called the Boston Massacre. Out of the terms of the 1773 Tea Act, Parliament cooked up a new strategy. Now the East India Company would sell the surplus tea directly through hand-picked consignees in America. This would lower the price to consumers, making British tea competitive with the smuggled variety while retaining some of the taxes. But the colonists saw through the British ploy and cried, "Monopoly!" Now it's a cold and rainy December 16, 1773. About 5,000 Bostonians are crowded into the Old South Meeting House, waiting to hear whether new shipments of tea that have arrived down the harbor will be unloaded for sale. When the captain of one of those ships reported that he could not leave with his cargo on board, Sam Adams rose to shout, "This meeting can do no more to save the country!" Cries of "Boston Harbor a teapot tonight!" rang out from the crowd, and about 50 men, some apparently dressed as Native Americans, marched down to Griffin's Wharf, stormed aboard three ships, and threw 340 tea chests overboard. An infuriated British government responsded with the so-called Coercive Acts of 1774, which, among other things, closed the port of Boston until the locals compensated the East India Company for the tea. That never happened. Representatives of the colonies gathered at Philadelphia to consider how best to respond to continued British oppression. This first Continental Congress supported destruction of the tea, pledged to support a continued boycott, and went home in late October 1774 even more united in their determination to protect their rights and liberties. The Boston Tea Party began a chain reaction that led with little pause to the Declaration of Independence and a bloody rebellion, after which the new nation was free to drink its tea, more or less, in peace.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Deep in the jungles of Vietnam, soldiers from both sides battled heat exhaustion and each other for nearly 20 long years. But the key to Communist victory wasn't weapons or stamina, it was a dirt road. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, started as a simple network of dirt roads and blossomed into the centerpiece of the winning North Vietnamese strategy during the Vietnam War, supplying weapons, troops, and psychological support to the South. The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and river crossings that threaded west out of North Vietnam and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range between Vietnam and Laos. The journey to the South originally took six months. But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail. Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one week. Here is how it happened. In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. The first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction. Initially, most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam. They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf. They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the body. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats. Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out. Fear, boredom, and homesickness were the dominant emotions. And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers. The first troops down the trail did not engage in much fighting. And after an exhausting six month trip, arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song. By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck. Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground. As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S. bombing. They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft. Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks. Their catch cries were, "Everything for our Southern brothers!" and, "We will not worry about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through." Some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads. Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining roads. The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny. The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's success. North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin. Americans recognized its achievement, calling the trail, "One of the great achievements in military engineering of the 20th century." The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros.

**Transcript**:
Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Deep in the jungles of Vietnam, soldiers from both sides battled heat exhaustion and each other for nearly 20 long years. But the key to Communist victory wasn't weapons or stamina, it was a dirt road. The Ho Chi Minh Trail, winding through Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, started as a simple network of dirt roads and blossomed into the centerpiece of the winning North Vietnamese strategy during the Vietnam War, supplying weapons, troops, and psychological support to the South. The trail was a network of tracks, dirt roads, and river crossings that threaded west out of North Vietnam and south along the Truong Son Mountain Range between Vietnam and Laos. The journey to the South originally took six months. But, with engineering and ingenuity, the Vietnamese expanded and improved the trail. Towards the end of war, as the main roads detoured through Laos, it only took one week. Here is how it happened. In 1959, as relations deteriorated between the North and the South, a system of trails was constructed in order to infiltrate soldiers, weapons, and supplies into South Vietnam. The first troops moved in single-file along routes used by local ethnic groups, and broken tree branches at dusty crossroads were often all that indicated the direction. Initially, most of the Communist cadres who came down the trail were Southerners by birth who had trained in North Vietnam. They dressed like civilian peasants in black, silk pajamas with a checkered scarf. They wore Ho Chi Minh sandals on their feet, cut from truck tires, and carried their ration of cooked rice in elephants' intestines, a linen tube hung around the body. The conditions were harsh and many deaths were caused by exposure, malaria, and amoebic dysentery. Getting lost, starving to death, and the possibility of attacks by wild tigers or bears were constant threats. Meals were invariably just rice and salt, and it was easy to run out. Fear, boredom, and homesickness were the dominant emotions. And soldiers occupied their spare time by writing letters, drawing sketches, and drinking and smoking with local villagers. The first troops down the trail did not engage in much fighting. And after an exhausting six month trip, arriving in the South was a real highlight, often celebrated by bursting into song. By 1965, the trip down the trail could be made by truck. Thousands of trucks supplied by China and Russia took up the task amidst ferocious B-52 bombing and truck drivers became known as pilots of the ground. As traffic down the trail increased, so did the U.S. bombing. They drove at night or in the early morning to avoid air strikes, and watchmen were ready to warn drivers of enemy aircraft. Villages along the trail organized teams to guarantee traffic flow and to help drivers repair damage caused by air attacks. Their catch cries were, "Everything for our Southern brothers!" and, "We will not worry about our houses if the vehicles have not yet gotten through." Some families donated their doors and wooden beds to repair roads. Vietnamese forces even used deception to get the U.S. aircraft to bomb mountainsides in order to make gravel for use in building and maintaining roads. The all-pervading red dust seeped into every nook and cranny. The Ho Chi Minh Trail had a profound impact on the Vietnam War and it was the key to Hanoi's success. North Vietnamese victory was not determined by the battlefields, but by the trail, which was the political, strategic, and economic lynchpin. Americans recognized its achievement, calling the trail, "One of the great achievements in military engineering of the 20th century." The trail is a testimony to the strength of will of the Vietnamese people, and the men and women who used the trail have become folk heros.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Great weather we're having! Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right? Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when someone says, "Great weather we're having," it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone says, "Great weather we're having," he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes. When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the second example: "Awesome job!" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So when the passenger says, "Awesome job!" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. "You're a talented athlete," said to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant. That is verbal irony. You have said the opposite of what you mean. Additionally, since you have the intention of mocking this poor person, you have not only been verbally ironic, but sarcastic as well. Beware, though. While all sarcasm fits the definition of verbal irony, not all verbal irony is sarcastic. Verbal irony is where what is meant is the opposite of what is said, while sarcasm adds that little punch of attitude.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Great weather we're having! Awesome job! You're a tremendous athlete! Compliments, right? Well, maybe. Depending on the attitude and tone of voice behind these lines, they very well may be compliments. They may also be, though, pointed and attacking lines. This slight change of attitude behind the lines reveals what we call verbal irony. So when someone says, "Great weather we're having," it is quite possible that the person really means that if the sun is shining, the birds are singing, and the wind is calm. But if the weather is horrible, the clouds are looming, and the wind is a raging tempest, and someone says, "Great weather we're having," he probably doesn't actually mean that. He probably means that the weather is horrible, but he has said the opposite. This is verbal irony when the speaker says the opposite of what he means. I know what you're thinking. Isn't this sarcasm, isn't the speaker being sarcastic? Yes. When a speaker says the opposite of what he means, that is verbal irony. When a speaker then goes the step farther to mean the opposite of what he says and seeks to be a little pointed and mean, like he's making fun of something, then you have sarcasm. Take the second example: "Awesome job!" Someone accomplishing his life-long dream: awesome! Someone winning a sports championship: awesome! Someone rear-ends another car: not awesome. So when the passenger says, "Awesome job!" they probably mean the opposite with a hint of poking fun. That is verbal irony and that is sarcastic. "You're a talented athlete," said to an Olympian: authentic, no verbal irony present. Said to the klutzy kid tripping into English class and spilling his books and pencil case all over the room, now that is just harsh and verbally ironic because what you said is not what you meant.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics
from your parents. They're able to calculate probabilities
of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information
from the parents and the family history. But how is this possible? To understand how traits pass
from one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time
to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants
he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles
that rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined
a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait
the dominant one, because it was expressed
in all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded
hybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,
he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait
had been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait
the recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends
on a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors
are called alleles and represent the different
variations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele
Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles
is known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles
are distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram
called the Punnett square. You place the different
alleles on both axes and then figure out
the possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele
as an uppercase "Y" and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase "y." The uppercase Y always
overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,
the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid
a yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad
will give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids
will be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have
any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have
a lot of characteristics. For example, besides
being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all
these possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions
for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it
a little more complex. And lots of things are more
complicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more
about genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which
some characteristics are inherited. But, it all started
with Mendel and his peas.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar These days scientists know how you inherit characteristics
from your parents. They're able to calculate probabilities
of having a specific trait or getting a genetic disease according to the information
from the parents and the family history. But how is this possible? To understand how traits pass
from one living being to its descendants, we need to go back in time
to the 19th century and a man named Gregor Mendel. Mendel was an Austrian monk and biologist who loved to work with plants. By breeding the pea plants
he was growing in the monastery's garden, he discovered the principles
that rule heredity. In one of most classic examples, Mendel combined
a purebred yellow-seeded plant with a purebred green-seeded plant, and he got only yellow seeds. He called the yellow-colored trait
the dominant one, because it was expressed
in all the new seeds. Then he let the new yellow-seeded
hybrid plants self-fertilize. And in this second generation,
he got both yellow and green seeds, which meant the green trait
had been hidden by the dominant yellow. He called this hidden trait
the recessive trait. From those results, Mendel inferred that each trait depends
on a pair of factors, one of them coming from the mother and the other from the father. Now we know that these factors
are called alleles and represent the different
variations of a gene. Depending on which type of allele
Mendel found in each seed, we can have what we call a homozygous pea,
where both alleles are identical, and what we call a heterozygous pea, when the two alleles are different. This combination of alleles
is known as genotype and its result, being yellow or green, is called phenotype. To clearly visualize how alleles
are distributed amongst descendants, we can a diagram
called the Punnett square. You place the different
alleles on both axes and then figure out
the possible combinations. Let's look at Mendel's peas, for example. Let's write the dominant yellow allele
as an uppercase "Y" and the recessive green allele
as a lowercase "y." The uppercase Y always
overpowers his lowercase friend, so the only time you get green babies is if you have lowercase Y's. In Mendel's first generation,
the yellow homozygous pea mom will give each pea kid
a yellow-dominant allele, and the green homozygous pea dad
will give a green-recessive allele. So all the pea kids
will be yellow heterozygous. Then, in the second generation, where the two heterozygous kids marry, their babies could have
any of the three possible genotypes, showing the two possible phenotypes in a three-to-one proportion. But even peas have
a lot of characteristics. For example, besides
being yellow or green, peas may be round or wrinkled. So we could have all
these possible combinations: round yellow peas, round green peas, wrinkled yellow peas, wrinkled green peas. To calculate the proportions
for each genotype and phenotype, we can use a Punnett square too. Of course, this will make it
a little more complex. And lots of things are more
complicated than peas, like, say, people. These days, scientists know a lot more
about genetics and heredity. And there are many other ways in which
some characteristics are inherited. But, it all started
with Mendel and his peas.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning. Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food. They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate. We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot. She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit." Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room. When you went to get a shot, the words, "This won't hurt a bit," became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning. After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, "Thank you for helping me." In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs. Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists. Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces.

Using food as a positive reinforcer, scientists have taught pigeons to select paintings by Monet over those by Picasso. When showed works of other artists, scientists observed stimulus generalization as the pigeons chose the Impressionists over the Cubists. Maybe next they'll condition the pigeons to paint their own masterpieces.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we think about learning, we often picture students in a classroom or lecture hall, books open on their desks, listening intently to a teacher or professor in the front of the room. But in psychology, learning means something else. To psychologists, learning is a long-term change in behavior that's based on experience. Two of the main types of learning are called classical conditioning and operant, or instrumental, conditioning. Let's talk about classical conditioning first. In the 1890's, a Russian physiologist named Ivan Pavlov did some really famous experiments on dogs. He showed dogs some food and rang a bell at the same time. After a while, the dogs would associate the bell with the food. They would learn that when they heard the bell, they would get fed. Eventually, just ringing the bell made the dogs salivate. They learned to expect food at the sound of a bell. You see, under normal conditions, the sight and smell of food causes a dog to salivate. We call the food an unconditioned stimulus, and we call salivation the unconditioned response. Nobody trains a dog to salivate over some steak. However, when we pair an unconditioned stimulus like food with something that was previously neutral, like the sound of a bell, that neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus. And so classical conditioning was discovered. We see how this works with animals, but how does it work with humans? In exactly the same way. Let's say that one day you go to the doctor to get a shot. She says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit," and then gives you the most painful shot you've ever had. A few weeks later you go to the dentist for a check-up. He starts to put a mirror in your mouth to examine your teeth, and he says, "Don't worry, this won't hurt a bit." Even though you know the mirror won't hurt, you jump out of the chair and run, screaming from the room. When you went to get a shot, the words, "This won't hurt a bit," became a conditioned stimulus when they were paired with pain of the shot, the unconditioned stimulus, which was followed by your conditioned response of getting the heck out of there. Classical conditioning in action. Operant conditioning explains how consequences lead to changes in voluntary behavior. So how does operant conditioning work? There are two main components in operant conditioning: reinforcement and punishment. Reinforcers make it more likely that you'll do something again, while punishers make it less likely. Reinforcement and punishment can be positive or negative, but this doesn't mean good and bad. Positive means the addition of a stimulus, like getting dessert after you finish your veggies, and negative means the removal of a stimulus, like getting a night of no homework because you did well on an exam. Let's look at an example of operant conditioning. After eating dinner with your family, you clear the table and wash the dishes. When you're done, your mom gives you a big hug and says, "Thank you for helping me." In this situation, your mom's response is positive reinforcement if it makes you more likely to repeat the operant response, which is to clear the table and wash the dishes. Operant conditioning is everywhere in our daily lives. There aren't many things we do that haven't been influenced at some point by operant conditioning. We even see operant conditioning in some extraordinary situations. One group of scientists showed the power of operant conditioning by teaching pigeons to be art connoisseurs.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever wonder where most of the food you eat every day comes from? Well, about 60% of the food you eat is carbohydrates. As you can probably tell from its name, carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But where do these atoms originally come from and how do they join together to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta? It actually all starts with the air you are exhaling this very minute, specifically the carbon dioxide molecules. Plants are going to breath in this very same carbon dioxide through pores in their skin, called stomata. Plants drink in water from their roots to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and their electrons, in order to build carbohydrates. What is that thing? Well, that's a special plant organelle inside the leaves of plants called a chloroplast. It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll. Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down. We call it fiber and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong. The plant could also turn that glucose into starch, a large molecule that stores energy for the plant. We love eating starch from plants like potatoes, corn, and rice. So you see, when you eat plants, we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis. The plant makes things like starch, which we eat and then break back down into glucose, the first form the plant made. Then, the mitochondria in our cells, powered by the oxygen we breath, can turn glucose into pure energy molecules called ATP. ATP powers all work done by each and every one of your cells, things like communication, movement, and transport. But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP? Well, think of it like this. You're excited to start your summer job at the local ice cream stand, but your boss has just told you that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones. What are you going to be able to do with those ice cream cones? Nothing, which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars. ATP is just like dollars. It is the currency that all cells of life use while glucose is, well, kind of like ice cream. Even plants have mitochondria in their cells to break down the glucose they make into ATP. So as you can see, humans and plants are intricately connected. The air we breath out is used by plants to make the carbohydrates we enjoy so much. And, in the process, they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules we need to breath in in order that our mitochondria can break down our delicous carbohydrate meal.

Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down. We call it fiber and we eat it in vegetables like lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Plants use cellulose to keep themselves strong. The plant could also turn that glucose into starch, a large molecule that stores energy for the plant. We love eating starch from plants like potatoes, corn, and rice. So you see, when you eat plants, we're actually benefiting from photosynthesis. The plant makes things like starch, which we eat and then break back down into glucose, the first form the plant made. Then, the mitochondria in our cells, powered by the oxygen we breath, can turn glucose into pure energy molecules called ATP. ATP powers all work done by each and every one of your cells, things like communication, movement, and transport. But why do we have to turn that glucose into ATP? Well, think of it like this. You're excited to start your summer job at the local ice cream stand, but your boss has just told you that she is going to pay you in ice cream cones. What are you going to be able to do with those ice cream cones? Nothing, which is why you kindly asked to be paid in dollars. ATP is just like dollars. It is the currency that all cells of life use while glucose is, well, kind of like ice cream. Even plants have mitochondria in their cells to break down the glucose they make into ATP. So as you can see, humans and plants are intricately connected. The air we breath out is used by plants to make the carbohydrates we enjoy so much. And, in the process, they are releasing the very same oxygen molecules we need to breath in in order that our mitochondria can break down our delicous carbohydrate meal.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Ever wonder where most of the food you eat every day comes from? Well, about 60% of the food you eat is carbohydrates. As you can probably tell from its name, carbohydrates contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. But where do these atoms originally come from and how do they join together to make delicious foods like fruits and pasta? It actually all starts with the air you are exhaling this very minute, specifically the carbon dioxide molecules. Plants are going to breath in this very same carbon dioxide through pores in their skin, called stomata. Plants drink in water from their roots to get the needed oxygen and hydrogen atoms, and their electrons, in order to build carbohydrates. What is that thing? Well, that's a special plant organelle inside the leaves of plants called a chloroplast. It's green beceause of a special light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll. Each leaf has about 44,000 cells and every cell can have anywhere between 20 to 100 chloroplasts. That's up to 4,400,000 chloroplasts! By now, you've probably guessed that we're talking about the process of photosynthesis and you might be wondering when the sun is going to make its entrance. Let's go back to that original molecule of water. The plant has to split this molecule of water so it can get electrons from it. But, the plant can't pull that water apart by itself. It needs help from the high-energy rays of the sun. So now that the chloroplast has all the building blocks - carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and electrons - it can use them to go through the rest of the steps of photosynthesis to transform that original carbon dioxide gas into a simple carbohydrate called glucose, C-6-H-12-O-6. That little glucose molecule then helps to build bigger and better carbohydrates like cellulose. Cellulose is a type of carbohydrate found in plants that our body cannot break down.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar By now, I'm sure you know that in just about anything you do in life, you need numbers. In particular, though, some fields don't just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a "matrix," and many of them hanging out together, "matrices". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let's get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can't divide them, but that's a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that's pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there's more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It's not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here's how it works. Let's say you have two matrices. Let's make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there's two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let's put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here's your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There's one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can't be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you're careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it's pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There's so much you can do with them. For example, let's say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let's say it's "Math rules". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you've got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There's even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it's pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar By now, I'm sure you know that in just about anything you do in life, you need numbers. In particular, though, some fields don't just need a few numbers, they need lots of them. How do you keep track of all those numbers? Well, mathematicians dating back as early as ancient China came up with a way to represent arrays of many numbers at once. Nowadays we call such an array a "matrix," and many of them hanging out together, "matrices". Matrices are everywhere. They are all around us, even now in this very room. Sorry, let's get back on track. Matrices really are everywhere, though. They are used in business, economics, cryptography, physics, electronics, and computer graphics. One reason matrices are so cool is that we can pack so much information into them and then turn a huge series of different problems into one single problem. So, to use matrices, we need to learn how they work. It turns out, you can treat matrices just like regular numbers. You can add them, subtract them, even multiply them. You can't divide them, but that's a rabbit hole of its own. Adding matrices is pretty simple. All you have to do is add the corresponding entries in the order they come. So the first entries get added together, the second entries, the third, all the way down. Of course, your matrices have to be the same size, but that's pretty intuitive anyway. You can also multiply the whole matrix by a number, called a scalar. Just multiply every entry by that number. But wait, there's more! You can actually multiply one matrix by another matrix. It's not like adding them, though, where you do it entry by entry. It's more unique and pretty cool once you get the hang of it. Here's how it works. Let's say you have two matrices. Let's make them both two by two, meaning two rows by two columns. Write the first matrix to the left and the second matrix goes next to it and translated up a bit, kind of like we are making a table. The product we get when we multiply the matrices together will go right between them. We'll also draw some gridlines to help us along. Now, look at the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix. See how there's two numbers in each? Multiply the first number in the row by the first number in the column: 1 times 2 is 2. Now do the next ones: 3 times 3 is 9. Now add them up: 2 plus 9 is 11. Let's put that number in the top-left position so that it matches up with the rows and columns we used to get it. See how that works? You can do the same thing to get the other entries. -4 plus 0 is -4. 4 plus -3 is 1. -8 plus 0 is -8. So, here's your answer. Not all that bad, is it? There's one catch, though. Just like with addition, your matrices have to be the right size. Look at these two matrices. 2 times 8 is 16. 3 times 4 is 12. 3 times wait a minute, there are no more rows in the second matrix. We ran out of room. So, these matrices can't be multiplied. The number of columns in the first matrix has to be the same as the number of rows in the second matrix. As long as you're careful to match up your dimensions right, though, it's pretty easy. Understanding matrix multiplication is just the beginning, by the way. There's so much you can do with them. For example, let's say you want to encrypt a secret message. Let's say it's "Math rules". Though, why anybody would want to keep this a secret is beyond me. Letting numbers stand for letters, you can put the numbers in a matrix and then an encryption key in another. Multiply them together and you've got a new encoded matrix. The only way to decode the new matrix and read the message is to have the key, that second matrix. There's even a branch of mathematics that uses matrices constantly, called Linear Algebra. If you ever get a chance to study Linear Algebra, do it, it's pretty awesome. But just remember, once you know how to use matrices, you can do pretty much anything.

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo all have in common
with the heroes of ancient myths? (Roar) What if I told you they are all variants
of the same hero? Do you believe that? Joseph Campbell did. He studied myths from all over the world
and published a book called "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," retelling dozens of stories and explaining how each
represents the mono-myth, or Hero's Journey. So, what is the "hero's journey"? Think of it as a cycle. The journey begins and ends
in a hero's ordinary world, but the quest passes
through an unfamiliar, special world. Along the way, there are some key events. Think about your favorite book or movie. Does it follow this pattern? Status quo, that's where we start. 1:00: Call to Adventure. The hero receives a mysterious message. An invitation, a challenge? 2:00: Assistance The hero needs some help,
probably from someone older, wiser. 3:00: Departure The hero crosses the threshold

fits the hero's journey template. When does Katniss Everdeen
hear her call to adventure that gets the story moving? When her sister's name
is called from the lottery. How about assistance? Is anyone going to help
her on her adventure? Haymitch. What about departure? Does she leave her ordinary world? She gets on a train to the capital. OK, so you get the idea. What do you have in common
with Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo? Well, you're human, just like them. The Hero's Journey myth
exists in all human cultures and keeps getting updated, because we humans reflect on our world through symbolic stories of our own lives. You leave your comfort zone, have an experience that transforms you, and then you recover and do it again. You don't literally slay
dragons or fight Voldemort, but you face problems just as scary. Joseph Campbell said, "In the cave you fear to enter
lies the treasure you seek." What is the symbolic
cave you fear to enter? Auditions for the school play? Baseball tryouts? Love? Watch for this formula in books,
movies, and TV shows you come across. You will certainly see it again. But also be sensitive
to it in your own life. Listen for your call to adventure. Accept the challenge. Conquer your fear
and claim the treasure you seek. And then, do it all over again.

Translator: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar What do Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, and Frodo all have in common
with the heroes of ancient myths? (Roar) What if I told you they are all variants
of the same hero? Do you believe that? Joseph Campbell did. He studied myths from all over the world
and published a book called "The Hero with a Thousand Faces," retelling dozens of stories and explaining how each
represents the mono-myth, or Hero's Journey. So, what is the "hero's journey"? Think of it as a cycle. The journey begins and ends
in a hero's ordinary world, but the quest passes
through an unfamiliar, special world. Along the way, there are some key events. Think about your favorite book or movie. Does it follow this pattern? Status quo, that's where we start. 1:00: Call to Adventure. The hero receives a mysterious message. An invitation, a challenge? 2:00: Assistance The hero needs some help,
probably from someone older, wiser. 3:00: Departure The hero crosses the threshold
from his normal, safe home, and enters the special
world and adventure. We're not in Kansas anymore. 4:00: Trials Being a hero is hard work: our hero solves a riddle, slays a monster, escapes from a trap. 5:00: Approach It's time to face the biggest ordeal,

Reviewer: Bedirhan Cinar Of all the spectacles mankind has viewed through a telescope, there are few lovelier than a spiral galaxy. Majestic whirlpools of stars, they rotate in a stately and predictable dance. The fact that we see many billions of them in our telescopes tells us they are both common and stable. It is perhaps surprising that it is relatively easy to understand the inner workings of these cosmic pinwheels. By combining physical principles worked out by Sir Isaac Newton in the late 17th century, with the observed amount of mass in a galaxy, scientists can calculate the rates at which these galaxies rotate. Using these techniques, astronomers predict how fast stars at different distances from the center of the galaxy should move. Stars very close to the center move slowly. That's because there is very little mass between them and the center of the galaxy to pull them along. Stars a bit further away move faster, because they are being pulled by all of the stars in between them and the center. As we get really far away, the stars are predicted to move slowly again. Their great distance reduces gravity to a gentle tug, so they move leisurely in their orbits. Knowing this, scientists looked at the galaxies and measured how fast stars were moving. To their surprise, they found that while the stars closer to the center of the galaxy behaved as predicted, those further away moved far too quickly. This observation was devastating to the tradtional theories of gravity and motion. If the stars were moving as fast as their measurement suggested, galaxies should have torn themselves apart. It was a crisis, and astronomers and physicists scrambled to find a mistake in their calculation. Was Newton's theory of gravity wrong? Was his theory of motion wrong? Or was it possible that astronomers had incorrectly measured the galaxy's mass? All options were investigated, and all were ruled out. Except one. Today, scientists believe that the answer lies in a previously unknown kind of matter, called dark matter. This dark matter can be envisioned as a cloud which surrounds most galaxies. This matter is very unusual. It is affected by gravity, but it is invisible to visible light and all other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The name "dark matter" originates in this form of matter's inability to emit or absorb light. Dark matter adds to the gravity of the galaxy and explains the orbital speed of stars far from the galactic center. Dark matter has not yet been directly observed, but scientists believe that it is likely to be real, mostly because the other options have been ruled out. Using dozens of approaches, astronomers and physicists continue to search for direct evidence that would prove that the dark matter hypothesis is true. This question is one of the most important physics research questions of the 21st century.

Transcriber: Ido Dekkers
Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo (Music) The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth? Scientists who are called astrobiologists are trying to find that out right now. Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out if there's microbial life on Mars, or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan. But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI. SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence that intelligent creatures elsewhere have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort. But how likely is it that they will manage to find a signal? There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI, but something called the Drake equation, named after Frank Drake, can help us organize our thinking about what might be required for successful detection. If you've dealt with equations before, then you probably expect that there will be a solution to the equation, a right answer. The Drake equation, however, is different, because there are so many unknowns. It has no right answer. As we learn more about our universe and our place within it, some of the unknowns get better known, and we can estimate an answer a bit better. But there won't be a definite answer to the Drake equation until SETI succeeds or something else proves that Earthlings are the only intelligent species in our portion of the cosmos. In the meantime, it is really useful to consider the unknowns. The Drake equation attempts to estimate the number of technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy -- we call that N -- with whom we could make contact, and it's usually written as: N equals R-star multiplied by f-sub-p multiplied by n-sub-e multiplied by f-sub-l multiplied by f-sub-i multiplied by f-sub-c and lastly, multiplied by capital L. All those factors multiplied together help to estimate the number of technological civilizations that we might be able to detect right now. R-star is the rate at which stars have been born in the Milky Way Galaxy over the last few billion years, so it's a number that is stars per year. Our galaxy is 10 billion years old, and early in its history stars formed at a different rate. All of the f-factors are fractions. Each one must be less than or equal to one. F-sub-p is the fraction of stars that have planets. N-sub-e is the average number of habitable planets in any planetary system. F-sub-l is the fraction of planets on which life actually begins and f-sub-i is the fraction of all those life forms that develop intelligence. F-sub-c is the fraction of intelligent life that develops a civilization that decides to use some sort of transmitting technology. And finally, L -- the longevity factor. On average, how many years do those transmitters continue to operate? Astronomers are now almost able to tell us what the product of the first three terms is. We're now finding exoplanets almost everywhere. The fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many, many experts ponder, but nobody knows for sure. So far, we only know of one place in the universe where life exists, and that's right here on Earth. In the next couple of decades, as we explore Mars and Europa and Titan, the discovery of any kind of life there will mean that life will be abundant in the Milky Way. Because if life originated twice within this one Solar System, it means it was easy, and given similar conditions elsewhere, life will happen. So the number two is a very important number here. Scientists, including SETI researchers, often tend to make very crude estimates and acknowledge that there are very large uncertainties in these estimates, in order to make progress. We think we know that R-star and n-sub-e are both numbers that are closer to 10 than, say, to one, and all the f-factors are less than one. Some of them may be much less than one. But of all these unknowns, the biggest unknown is L, so perhaps the most useful version of the Drake equation is simply to say that N is approximately equal to L. The information in this equation is very clear. Unless L is large, N will be small. But, you know, you can also turn that around. If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal in the near future, after examining only a small portion of the stars in the Milky Way, then we learn that L, on average, must be large. Otherwise, we couldn't have succeeded so easily. A physicist named Philip Morrison summarizes by saying that SETI is the archaeology of the future. By this, he meant that because the speed of light is finite, any signals detected from distant technologies will be telling us about their past by the time they reach us. But because L must be large for a successful detection, we also learn about our future, particularly that we can have a long future. We've developed technologies that can send signals into space and humans to the moon, but we've also developed technologies that can destroy the environment, that can wage war with weapons and biological terrorism. In the future, will our technology help stabilize our planet and our population, leading to a very long lifetime for us? Or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage? I encourage you to consider the unknowns in this equation. Why don't you make your own estimates for these unknowns, and see what you come up with for N? Compare that with the estimates made by Frank Drake, Carl Sagan, other scientists or your neighbors. Remember, there's no right answer. Not yet.

Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo (Music) The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth? Scientists who are called astrobiologists are trying to find that out right now. Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out if there's microbial life on Mars, or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan. But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI. SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence that intelligent creatures elsewhere have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort. But how likely is it that they will manage to find a signal? There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI, but something called the Drake equation, named after Frank Drake, can help us organize our thinking about what might be required for successful detection. If you've dealt with equations before, then you probably expect that there will be a solution to the equation, a right answer.

Transcriber: Ido Dekkers
Reviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo (Music) The basic question is, does life exist beyond Earth? Scientists who are called astrobiologists are trying to find that out right now. Most astrobiologists are trying to figure out if there's microbial life on Mars, or in the ocean under the frozen surface of Jupiter's moon Europa, or in the liquid hydrocarbon lakes that we've found on Saturn's moon Titan. But one group of astrobiologists works on SETI. SETI is the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, and SETI researchers are trying to detect some evidence that intelligent creatures elsewhere have used technology to build a transmitter of some sort. But how likely is it that they will manage to find a signal? There are certainly no guarantees when it comes to SETI, but something called the Drake equation, named after Frank Drake, can help us organize our thinking about what might be required for successful detection. If you've dealt with equations before, then you probably expect that there will be a solution to the equation, a right answer. The Drake equation, however, is different, because there are so many unknowns. It has no right answer. As we learn more about our universe and our place within it, some of the unknowns get better known, and we can estimate an answer a bit better. But there won't be a definite answer to the Drake equation until SETI succeeds or something else proves that Earthlings are the only intelligent species in our portion of the cosmos. In the meantime, it is really useful to consider the unknowns. The Drake equation attempts to estimate the number of technological civilizations in the Milky Way Galaxy -- we call that N -- with whom we could make contact, and it's usually written as: N equals R-star multiplied by f-sub-p multiplied by n-sub-e multiplied by f-sub-l multiplied by f-sub-i multiplied by f-sub-c and lastly, multiplied by capital L. All those factors multiplied together help to estimate the number of technological civilizations that we might be able to detect right now. R-star is the rate at which stars have been born in the Milky Way Galaxy over the last few billion years, so it's a number that is stars per year. Our galaxy is 10 billion years old, and early in its history stars formed at a different rate. All of the f-factors are fractions. Each one must be less than or equal to one. F-sub-p is the fraction of stars that have planets. N-sub-e is the average number of habitable planets in any planetary system. F-sub-l is the fraction of planets on which life actually begins and f-sub-i is the fraction of all those life forms that develop intelligence. F-sub-c is the fraction of intelligent life that develops a civilization that decides to use some sort of transmitting technology. And finally, L -- the longevity factor. On average, how many years do those transmitters continue to operate? Astronomers are now almost able to tell us what the product of the first three terms is. We're now finding exoplanets almost everywhere. The fractions dealing with life and intelligence and technological civilizations are ones that many, many experts ponder, but nobody knows for sure. So far, we only know of one place in the universe where life exists, and that's right here on Earth. In the next couple of decades, as we explore Mars and Europa and Titan, the discovery of any kind of life there will mean that life will be abundant in the Milky Way. Because if life originated twice within this one Solar System, it means it was easy, and given similar conditions elsewhere, life will happen. So the number two is a very important number here. Scientists, including SETI researchers, often tend to make very crude estimates and acknowledge that there are very large uncertainties in these estimates, in order to make progress. We think we know that R-star and n-sub-e are both numbers that are closer to 10 than, say, to one, and all the f-factors are less than one. Some of them may be much less than one. But of all these unknowns, the biggest unknown is L, so perhaps the most useful version of the Drake equation is simply to say that N is approximately equal to L. The information in this equation is very clear. Unless L is large, N will be small. But, you know, you can also turn that around. If SETI succeeds in detecting a signal in the near future, after examining only a small portion of the stars in the Milky Way, then we learn that L, on average, must be large. Otherwise, we couldn't have succeeded so easily. A physicist named Philip Morrison summarizes by saying that SETI is the archaeology of the future. By this, he meant that because the speed of light is finite, any signals detected from distant technologies will be telling us about their past by the time they reach us. But because L must be large for a successful detection, we also learn about our future, particularly that we can have a long future. We've developed technologies that can send signals into space and humans to the moon, but we've also developed technologies that can destroy the environment, that can wage war with weapons and biological terrorism. In the future, will our technology help stabilize our planet and our population, leading to a very long lifetime for us? Or will we destroy our world and its inhabitants after only a brief appearance on the cosmic stage? I encourage you to consider the unknowns in this equation. Why don't you make your own estimates for these unknowns, and see what you come up with for N? Compare that with the estimates made by Frank Drake, Carl Sagan, other scientists or your neighbors. Remember, there's no right answer. Not yet.

(Music) On a typical day at school, endless hours are spent learning the answers to questions. But right now, we'll do the opposite. We're going to focus on questions where you can't learn the answers, because they're unknown. I used to puzzle about a lot of things as a boy. For example, what would it feel like to be a dog? Do fish feel pain? How about insects? Was the Big Bang just an accident? And is there a God? And if so, how are we so sure that it's a He and not a She? Why do so may innocent people and animals suffer terrible things? Is there really a plan for my life? Is the future yet to be written, or is it already written and we just can't see it? But then, do I have free will? Who am I, anyway? Am I just a biological machine? But then, why am I conscious? What is consciousness? Will robots become conscious one day? I mean, I kind of assumed that some day I would be told the answers to all these questions. I mean, someone must know, right? Huh. Guess what? No one knows. Most of those questions puzzle me more now than ever. But diving into them is exciting because it takes you to the edge of knowledge, and you never know what you'll find there.

**Transcript**:
Somewhere out there in that vast universe, there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life, but why don't we see any evidence of it? Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950: "Where is everybody?" Conspiracy theorists claim
that UFOs are visiting all the time and the reports are just being covered up, but honestly, they aren't very convincing. But that leaves a real riddle. In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars, and if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be
half a trillion planets just in our own galaxy. If any one in 10,000 has conditions
that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way. So here's the riddle. Our Earth didn't form until about 9 billion years
after the Big Bang. Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billions or certainly
many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth. If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies
would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power. On Earth, we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate in just 100 years. In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out
across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts, or fleets of colonizing spaceships, or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single,

Somewhere out there in that vast universe, there must surely be countless
other planets teeming with life, but why don't we see any evidence of it? Well, this is the famous question
asked by Enrico Fermi in 1950: "Where is everybody?" Conspiracy theorists claim
that UFOs are visiting all the time and the reports are just being covered up, but honestly, they aren't very convincing. But that leaves a real riddle. In the past year,
the Kepler space observatory has found hundreds of planets
just around nearby stars, and if you extrapolate that data, it looks like there could be
half a trillion planets just in our own galaxy. If any one in 10,000 has conditions
that might support a form of life, that's still 50 million possible
life-harboring planets right here in the Milky Way. So here's the riddle. Our Earth didn't form until about 9 billion years
after the Big Bang. Countless other planets in our galaxy
should have formed earlier and given life a chance to get underway billions or certainly
many millions of years earlier than happened on Earth. If just a few of them
had spawned intelligent life and started creating technologies, those technologies
would have had millions of years to grow in complexity and power. On Earth, we've seen how dramatically
technology can accelerate in just 100 years. In millions of years,
an intelligent alien civilization could easily have spread out
across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts, or fleets of colonizing spaceships, or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy, and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors. It's just sitting there

across the galaxy, perhaps creating giant
energy-harvesting artifacts, or fleets of colonizing spaceships, or glorious works of art
that fill the night sky. At the very least, you'd think
they'd be revealing their presence, deliberately or otherwise, through electromagnetic signals
of one kind or another. And yet we see no convincing
evidence of any of it. Why? Well, there are numerous possible answers, some of them quite dark. Maybe a single,
superintelligent civilization has indeed taken over the galaxy, and has imposed strict radio silence because it's paranoid
of any potential competitors. It's just sitting there
ready to obliterate anything that becomes a threat. Or maybe they're not that intelligent. Or perhaps, the evolution
of an intelligence capable of creating
sophisticated technology is far rarer than we've assumed. After all, it's only happened once on Earth in 4 billion years. Maybe even that was incredibly lucky. Maybe we are the first
such civilization in our galaxy. Or, perhaps, civilization carries with it the seeds of its own destruction through the inability to control
the technologies it creates. But there are numerous
more hopeful answers. For a start, we're not looking that hard, and we're spending a pitiful
amount of money on it. Only a tiny fraction
of the stars in our galaxy have really been looked at closely
for signs of interesting signals. And perhaps, we're not looking
the right way. Maybe as civilizations develop, they quickly discover
communication technologies far more sophisticated and useful
than electromagnetic waves. Maybe all the action takes place inside the mysterious
recently discovered dark matter, or dark energy, that appear to account
for most of the universe's mass. Or maybe we're looking at the wrong scale. Perhaps intelligent civilizations
come to realize that life is ultimately just complex
patterns of information interacting with each other
in a beautiful way, and that can happen
more efficiently at a small scale. So just as on Earth, clunky stereo systems
have shrunk to beautiful, tiny iPods, maybe intelligent life itself, in order to reduce its footprint
on the environment, has turned itself microscopic, so the Solar System
might be teeming with aliens, and we're just not noticing them. Maybe the very ideas in our heads
are a form of alien life. Well, okay, that's a crazy thought. The aliens made me say it. But it is cool that ideas do seem
to have a life all of their own, and that they outlive their creators. Maybe biological life
is just a passing phase. Well, within the next 15 years, we could start seeing
real spectroscopic information from promising nearby planets that will reveal just how
life-friendly they might be. And meanwhile SETI, the Search for
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence, is now releasing its data to the public so that millions of citizen scientists,
maybe including you, can bring the power of the crowd
to join the search. And here on Earth,
amazing experiments are being done to try to create life from scratch, life that might be very different
from the DNA forms we know. All of this will help us understand whether the universe is teeming with life or, whether indeed, it's just us. Either answer, in its own way, is awe-inspiring, because even if we are alone, the fact that we think and dream, and ask these questions might yet turn out to be
one of the most important facts about the universe. And I have one more piece
of good news for you. The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull. It doesn't. It's actually the opposite. The more you know, the more amazing the world seems. And it's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions, that pull us forward. So, stay curious.

**Transcript**:
the pirate films and the romantic films of the 40's was definitely an influence on on Star Wars Errol Flynn kinds of movies I mean everything is of that genre which is the fantasy action-adventure kinds of films of that period of time in the in the cinema look the whole premise of Star Wars was that it was a romantic fantasy in the in the great romantic traditions of mythology and King Arthur and the romantic side of fighting where there was chivalry and honor and that sort of things so in developing a group of peacekeepers who were above everything and an honorable and could make decisions and and bring peace to the galaxy I needed a weapon that was appropriate for those kinds of Jedi the father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow what is it your father's lightsaber this is the weapon of a Jedi Knight not as clumsy or random as a blaster an elegant weapon for a more civilized day it was more a symbol of a simpler time of a time before the Empire taken over a time when honor ruled so it was more of a symbol than it was an actual weapon in the movie moki religions and ancient weapons were no match for a good blaster - sorry kid you don't believe in the force do you the original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords and then I wanted to make it a futuristic kind of sword so I made it a lightsaber which those are of a laser sword to give it that technology edge to it in an age of ray guns and that sort of thing that would deflect the rays and since they're the whole premise was that a Jedi was there to protect himself and not really be offensive but be defensive that a laser sword in a world of ray guns would be a perfect defensive weapon started out as a kind of oriental form of swordplay where there was a lot of honor involved a lot of skill and craft and higher spiritual meaning to the sword fight and so they were very simple and in the beginning of the first film episode 4 it was a fight between a very old man and a man who was only a partially a man and mostly a mechanical beam so it wasn't really much of a sword fight at all but I guess I lost it only a master of evil does the original lightsaber was actually the flash attachment to a four by five camera and we just took the round flash part off and then made it into a lightsaber George was adamant that these things were really really heavy that we couldn't take a hand off we always had to have two like X calibers is 240 50 pounds of weight they were very powerful and a lot of energy in them and so that was you you know you worked with them as if they were heavy so because when he's crashed together they obey these big explosions and all kinds of things as we went on we wanted to have the lightsaber fights become faster and more intense as Luke became more proficient in the art of sword fighting and so we very slowly started moving away from the two-handed form which is more oriental to sometimes using a one-handed form and it's progressed further and further into a more two-handed and one-handed form but originally it was that you needed two hands to hold on to this lightsaber because of the amount of energy that is being swung around see you can do it I call it luck in my experience there's no such thing as luck The effect of the lightsaber was basically a rotating poll that had movie screen material applied to it so that it would reflect its light source packet many times the intensity problem was that when you moved it out of a certain area it went from glowing and looking great to just a rotating pole we rotated with reflective tape so that would flash and it would create light on the actors on that never really worked as soon as they hit each other they broke the lightsabers so then we just used the sticks with the reflective material on it as we moved on we got more proficient at actually doing sword fighting we then use swords that did to have the reflective material but we toned down the fact that we had to shoot the light through the lens and a lot of other things to try to make it so we could be more facile in the way we shot these fights when I beat a tech - I thought it would just be handled and they put in cartoon blades later but if you were if you were sword fighting you you wouldn't know when to stop your hand you needed something to strike every laser sword really is part real and part animated and we need the real poll to tell us where the sword blade is and sometimes we'll use a short blade because they're fighting so close that they would hit the set and things like that and sometimes we use no blade because the blade would turn on in the shop or what they were doing was so complicated that we couldn't do it with swords themselves and then we would add the sword in later but that takes a lot of very careful tracking to figure out where the sword blade would be and even later on in the second and third one when they decided that it was more trouble than was worth to try and get on Sat shots that they just do it all in post we still had part of a shaft just so that there would be something to come up against that really had a lot to do with the advances in special-effects technology than it did in anything else as we got more and more able to do rotoscoping on these swords and we were using more advanced technology was easier for us to follow the sword and copy them and you know create laser swords it is useless to exist don't let yourself be destroyed as obi-wan did even though the like sabers were kind of chintzy when we were shooting him in post-production they were able to give him the look that they needed to have of course the great sound Ben Burtt sound effects the sound of the lightsaber was turned over to Ben Burke in the first film Ben worked you know really right from the very GetGo while I was working on the script and I would tell them that I needed a voice for our - I needed a voice for you know the breathing of Darth Vader I'd need a sound for ray guns I knew sound for laser swords the very first sound I created for the film was the lightsaber and it was I think what happened was I saw some of the Ralph McQuarrie artwork on the wall and I was a picture of Luke lighting at the end of the movie and they had these lightsabers and I thought immediately something went off in my mind and I and I had a feeling for what they would sound like in the booth where we projected films those projectors made a hum when they weren't running they were just idling that the motors would sit there with this kind of magical mysterious humming sound that I thought was musical in a way and I thought that's probably what a lightsaber would sound like yo Paul was a weak old man you can't wind us if you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine and I was searching for some other element and I had a tape recorder with a broken mic cable it was actually the shielding and coming off of it and when I walked past the television set in my apartment it picked up the hum from the picture too directly into the broken wire and that made a buzz and I said that's a great buzz that's not as dangerous so I recorded the buzz now normally a sound person doesn't want to buzz or hum in this case the buzz in the hum were the answer and of course I had to take that sound and make the pass bys and the swishes of the sword out of it and so he spent you know the better part of a year working on those sounds trying to create those sounds the first time I put in the sounds of the lightsabers he was in it you know temporary cut of the film and not much comment was made about it and I but I have since learned that when no comment is made then it's fantastic that it's it's passes the test impressive most impressive ultimately the sound for the laser sword because we wanted something with a lot of energy was a combination of several different sounds from a swooshing vacuum cleaner to kind of clash when when something hits dry ice and we've modified it since then as yes we get weapons that move faster and be a double-edged blade savoring some of the newer films but it's always based on that same recording there's nothing you could have done Luke had you been there you'd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire I want to come with you to Alderaan there's nothing for me here now I want to learn the ways of the force and become a Jedi like my father in every episode from four five and six I kept improving the sword fighting because of the assumption was is that Luke was getting to be a better fighter he was learning more but at the same time he still wasn't you know being trained as an original Jedi would have been trained a Jedi uses the force for knowledge in defense never but tell me why I can't know there is no way nothing more would I teach you today an Empire Strikes Back it's the first time that the antagonist and pro Tigers actually fight each other so that it is a very big fight and Luke now has become proficient enough to be able to face Darth Vader so it's a slightly one-sided sword fight where Vader has the advantage over him but Luke didn't know that Vader was his father for the most really for fight part so that what it was happening is he thought he was fighting his bitter enemy and so he was fighting as hard as he could he thought he was fighting the man killed his father fighting the man who killed obi-wan Kenobi fighting the man who you know would personify evil in the universe and then as we go on into the next fight it becomes more of a an equal confrontation in the next one The Return of the Jedi he knew he was fighting his father I see you have constructed a new lightsaber he knew that the Emperor was behind all this your skills are complete and he knew that the issues that he was dealing with much larger than just the sword fight indeed you are powerful as the emperor has foreseen and so that sword fight really centered on the more emotional context the sword fight takes place in than the actual fighting itself that was the climax of the film rather than having it be a technological warfare blow up the Death Star kind of thing it was really more of a personal fight between a father and his son then when we move to the prequel where there were Jedi on their full flower and fighting as they were in the past you know well trained Jedi then we had to make the sword fights much much faster much more sophisticated and much more aggressive in terms of the way they're fought and we continued that brave of you boy what I would have thought you had learned your lesson hi I'm miss Lola manikin the fights becomes actually much more ferocious in save ones in Episode four five and six well at your head held that right now this is just the beginning each one builds on the other because the fights become more personal until we get to Episode three where it's a very personal form of fighting this particular one they have to fight each other so this is very very long fight difference between the two characters is that Obi one has more experience but Anika is more powerful that was good hey thanks everybody you know I'm here today as Luke Skywalker but I'm also here to talk about Sprint as you can see you stand to save up to 17 cents a month over the more dependable providers in the history of Hollywood few stars have so captured the imagination of fans as r2d2 the Vice

**Transcript**:
the pirate films and the romantic films of the 40's was definitely an influence on on Star Wars Errol Flynn kinds of movies I mean everything is of that genre which is the fantasy action-adventure kinds of films of that period of time in the in the cinema look the whole premise of Star Wars was that it was a romantic fantasy in the in the great romantic traditions of mythology and King Arthur and the romantic side of fighting where there was chivalry and honor and that sort of things so in developing a group of peacekeepers who were above everything and an honorable and could make decisions and and bring peace to the galaxy I needed a weapon that was appropriate for those kinds of Jedi the father wanted you to have this when you were old enough but your uncle wouldn't allow what is it your father's lightsaber this is the weapon of a Jedi Knight not as clumsy or random as a blaster an elegant weapon for a more civilized day it was more a symbol of a simpler time of a time before the Empire taken over a time when honor ruled so it was more of a symbol than it was an actual weapon in the movie moki religions and ancient weapons were no match for a good blaster - sorry kid you don't believe in the force do you the original concept was that the Jedi would fight with swords and then I wanted to make it a futuristic kind of sword so I made it a lightsaber which those are of a laser sword to give it that technology edge to it in an age of ray guns and that sort of thing that would deflect the rays and since they're the whole premise was that a Jedi was there to protect himself and not really be offensive but be defensive that a laser sword in a world of ray guns would be a perfect defensive weapon started out as a kind of oriental form of swordplay where there was a lot of honor involved a lot of skill and craft and higher spiritual meaning to the sword fight and so they were very simple and in the beginning of the first film episode 4 it was a fight between a very old man and a man who was only a partially a man and mostly a mechanical beam so it wasn't really much of a sword fight at all but I guess I lost it only a master of evil does the original lightsaber was actually the flash attachment to a four by five camera and we just took the round flash part off and then made it into a lightsaber George was adamant that these things were really really heavy that we couldn't take a hand off we always had to have two like X calibers is 240 50 pounds of weight they were very powerful and a lot of energy in them and so that was you you know you worked with them as if they were heavy so because when he's crashed together they obey these big explosions and all kinds of things as we went on we wanted to have the lightsaber fights become faster and more intense as Luke became more proficient in the art of sword fighting and so we very slowly started moving away from the two-handed form which is more oriental to sometimes using a one-handed form and it's progressed further and further into a more two-handed and one-handed form but originally it was that you needed two hands to hold on to this lightsaber because of the amount of energy that is being swung around see you can do it I call it luck in my experience there's no such thing as luck The effect of the lightsaber was basically a rotating poll that had movie screen material applied to it so that it would reflect its light source packet many times the intensity problem was that when you moved it out of a certain area it went from glowing and looking great to just a rotating pole we rotated with reflective tape so that would flash and it would create light on the actors on that never really worked as soon as they hit each other they broke the lightsabers so then we just used the sticks with the reflective material on it as we moved on we got more proficient at actually doing sword fighting we then use swords that did to have the reflective material but we toned down the fact that we had to shoot the light through the lens and a lot of other things to try to make it so we could be more facile in the way we shot these fights when I beat a tech - I thought it would just be handled and they put in cartoon blades later but if you were if you were sword fighting you you wouldn't know when to stop your hand you needed something to strike every laser sword really is part real and part animated and we need the real poll to tell us where the sword blade is and sometimes we'll use a short blade because they're fighting so close that they would hit the set and things like that and sometimes we use no blade because the blade would turn on in the shop or what they were doing was so complicated that we couldn't do it with swords themselves and then we would add the sword in later but that takes a lot of very careful tracking to figure out where the sword blade would be and even later on in the second and third one when they decided that it was more trouble than was worth to try and get on Sat shots that they just do it all in post we still had part of a shaft just so that there would be something to come up against that really had a lot to do with the advances in special-effects technology than it did in anything else as we got more and more able to do rotoscoping on these swords and we were using more advanced technology was easier for us to follow the sword and copy them and you know create laser swords it is useless to exist don't let yourself be destroyed as obi-wan did even though the like sabers were kind of chintzy when we were shooting him in post-production they were able to give him the look that they needed to have of course the great sound Ben Burtt sound effects the sound of the lightsaber was turned over to Ben Burke in the first film Ben worked you know really right from the very GetGo while I was working on the script and I would tell them that I needed a voice for our - I needed a voice for you know the breathing of Darth Vader I'd need a sound for ray guns I knew sound for laser swords the very first sound I created for the film was the lightsaber and it was I think what happened was I saw some of the Ralph McQuarrie artwork on the wall and I was a picture of Luke lighting at the end of the movie and they had these lightsabers and I thought immediately something went off in my mind and I and I had a feeling for what they would sound like in the booth where we projected films those projectors made a hum when they weren't running they were just idling that the motors would sit there with this kind of magical mysterious humming sound that I thought was musical in a way and I thought that's probably what a lightsaber would sound like yo Paul was a weak old man you can't wind us if you strike me down I shall become more powerful than you can possibly imagine and I was searching for some other element and I had a tape recorder with a broken mic cable it was actually the shielding and coming off of it and when I walked past the television set in my apartment it picked up the hum from the picture too directly into the broken wire and that made a buzz and I said that's a great buzz that's not as dangerous so I recorded the buzz now normally a sound person doesn't want to buzz or hum in this case the buzz in the hum were the answer and of course I had to take that sound and make the pass bys and the swishes of the sword out of it and so he spent you know the better part of a year working on those sounds trying to create those sounds the first time I put in the sounds of the lightsabers he was in it you know temporary cut of the film and not much comment was made about it and I but I have since learned that when no comment is made then it's fantastic that it's it's passes the test impressive most impressive ultimately the sound for the laser sword because we wanted something with a lot of energy was a combination of several different sounds from a swooshing vacuum cleaner to kind of clash when when something hits dry ice and we've modified it since then as yes we get weapons that move faster and be a double-edged blade savoring some of the newer films but it's always based on that same recording there's nothing you could have done Luke had you been there you'd have been killed too and the droids would now be in the hands of the Empire I want to come with you to Alderaan there's nothing for me here now I want to learn the ways of the force and become a Jedi like my father in every episode from four five and six I kept improving the sword fighting because of the assumption was is that Luke was getting to be a better fighter he was learning more but at the same time he still wasn't you know being trained as an original Jedi would have been trained a Jedi uses the force for knowledge in defense never but tell me why I can't know there is no way nothing more would I teach you today an Empire Strikes Back it's the first time that the antagonist and pro Tigers actually fight each other so that it is a very big fight and Luke now has become proficient enough to be able to face Darth Vader so it's a slightly one-sided sword fight where Vader has the advantage over him but Luke didn't know that Vader was his father for the most really for fight part so that what it was happening is he thought he was fighting his bitter enemy and so he was fighting as hard as he could he thought he was fighting the man killed his father fighting the man who killed obi-wan Kenobi fighting the man who you know would personify evil in the universe and then as we go on into the next fight it becomes more of a an equal confrontation in the next one The Return of the Jedi he knew he was fighting his father I see you have constructed a new lightsaber he knew that the Emperor was behind all this your skills are complete and he knew that the issues that he was dealing with much larger than just the sword fight indeed you are powerful as the emperor has foreseen and so that sword fight really centered on the more emotional context the sword fight takes place in than the actual fighting itself that was the climax of the film rather than having it be a technological warfare blow up the Death Star kind of thing it was really more of a personal fight between a father and his son then when we move to the prequel where there were Jedi on their full flower and fighting as they were in the past you know well trained Jedi then we had to make the sword fights much much faster much more sophisticated and much more aggressive in terms of the way they're fought and we continued that brave of you boy what I would have thought you had learned your lesson hi I'm miss Lola manikin the fights becomes actually much more ferocious in save ones in Episode four five and six well at your head held that right now this is just the beginning each one builds on the other because the fights become more personal until we get to Episode three where it's a very personal form of fighting this particular one they have to fight each other so this is very very long fight difference between the two characters is that Obi one has more experience but Anika is more powerful that was good hey thanks everybody you know I'm here today as Luke Skywalker but I'm also here to talk about Sprint as you can see you stand to save up to 17 cents a month over the more dependable providers in the history of Hollywood few stars have so captured the imagination of fans as r2d2 the Vice

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been waiting in line
at the grocery store, innocently perusing the magazine rack,
when a song pops into your head? Not the whole song, but a fragment of it
that plays and replays until you find yourself unloading
the vegetables in time to the beat. You've been struck by an earworm,
and you're not alone. Over 90% of people are plagued
by earworms at least once a week, and about a quarter of people
experience them several times a day. They tend to burrow in during tasks
that don't require much attention, say, when waiting on water to boil or a traffic light to change. This phenomenon is one 
of the mind's great mysteries. Scientists don't know 
exactly why it's so easy for tunes to get stuck in our heads. From a psychological perspective, earworms are an example of mental imagery. This imagery can be visual, like when you close your eyes
and imagine a red wagon, or it can be auditory, like when you imagine
the sound of a baby screaming, or oil sizzling in a pan. Earworms are a special form 
of auditory imagery because they're involuntary. You don't plug your ears
and try to imagine "Who Let the Dogs Out," or, well, you probably don't. It just intrudes onto 
your mental soundscape and hangs around 
like an unwanted house guest. Earworms tend to be quite vivid and they're normally made up of a tune,
rather than, say, harmonies. A remarkable feature of earworms
is their tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating again and again
for minutes or hours. Also remarkable is the role
of repetition in sparking earworms. Songs tend to get stuck when 
we listen to them recently and repeatedly. If repetition is such a trigger, then perhaps we can blame our earworms
on modern technology. The last hundred years have seen
an incredible proliferation of devices that help you listen 
to the same thing again and again. Records, cassettes, CDs, 
or streamed audio files. Have these technologies bread some
kind of unique, contemporary experience, and are earworms just a product
of the late 20th century? The answer comes from an unlikely source: Mark Twain. In 1876, just one year 
before the phonograph was invented, he wrote a short story
imagining a sinister takeover of an entire town by a rhyming jingle. This reference, and others, show us that earworms seem 
to be a basic psychological phenomenon, perhaps exacerbated 
by recording technology but not new to this century. So yes, every great historical figure,
from Shakespeare to Sacajawea, may well have wandered around
with a song stuck in their head. Besides music, it's hard to think
of another case of intrusive imagery that's so widespread. Why music? Why don't watercolors 
get stuck in our heads? Or the taste of cheesy taquitos? One theory has to do with the way music
is represented in memory. When we listen to a song we know, we're constantly hearing forward in time,
anticipating the next note. It's hard for us to think about one
particular musical moment in isolation. If we want to think about the pitch
of the word "you" in "Happy Birthday," we have to start back at "Happy," and sing through until we get to "you." In this way, a tune 
is sort of like a habit. Just like once you start tying your shoe, you're on automatic 
until you tighten the bow, once a tune is suggested because, for example, someone says,
"my umbrella," we have to play through until it
reaches a natural stopping point, "ella, ella, ella." But this is largely speculation. The basic fact remains we don't know
exactly why we're susceptible to earworms. But understanding them better 
could give us important clues to the workings of the human brain. Maybe the next time we're plagued by a Taylor Swift tune 
that just won't go away, we'll use it as the starting point
for a scientific odyssey that will unlock important mysteries
about basic cognition. And if not, well, 
we can just shake it off.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been waiting in line
at the grocery store, innocently perusing the magazine rack,
when a song pops into your head? Not the whole song, but a fragment of it
that plays and replays until you find yourself unloading
the vegetables in time to the beat. You've been struck by an earworm,
and you're not alone. Over 90% of people are plagued
by earworms at least once a week, and about a quarter of people
experience them several times a day. They tend to burrow in during tasks
that don't require much attention, say, when waiting on water to boil or a traffic light to change. This phenomenon is one 
of the mind's great mysteries. Scientists don't know 
exactly why it's so easy for tunes to get stuck in our heads. From a psychological perspective, earworms are an example of mental imagery. This imagery can be visual, like when you close your eyes
and imagine a red wagon, or it can be auditory, like when you imagine
the sound of a baby screaming, or oil sizzling in a pan. Earworms are a special form 
of auditory imagery because they're involuntary. You don't plug your ears
and try to imagine "Who Let the Dogs Out," or, well, you probably don't. It just intrudes onto 
your mental soundscape and hangs around 
like an unwanted house guest. Earworms tend to be quite vivid and they're normally made up of a tune,
rather than, say, harmonies. A remarkable feature of earworms
is their tendency to get stuck in a loop, repeating again and again
for minutes or hours. Also remarkable is the role
of repetition in sparking earworms. Songs tend to get stuck when 
we listen to them recently and repeatedly. If repetition is such a trigger, then perhaps we can blame our earworms
on modern technology. The last hundred years have seen
an incredible proliferation of devices that help you listen 
to the same thing again and again. Records, cassettes, CDs, 
or streamed audio files. Have these technologies bread some
kind of unique, contemporary experience, and are earworms just a product
of the late 20th century? The answer comes from an unlikely source: Mark Twain. In 1876, just one year 
before the phonograph was invented, he wrote a short story
imagining a sinister takeover of an entire town by a rhyming jingle. This reference, and others, show us that earworms seem 
to be a basic psychological phenomenon, perhaps exacerbated 
by recording technology but not new to this century. So yes, every great historical figure,
from Shakespeare to Sacajawea, may well have wandered around
with a song stuck in their head. Besides music, it's hard to think
of another case of intrusive imagery that's so widespread. Why music? Why don't watercolors 
get stuck in our heads? Or the taste of cheesy taquitos? One theory has to do with the way music
is represented in memory. When we listen to a song we know, we're constantly hearing forward in time,
anticipating the next note. It's hard for us to think about one
particular musical moment in isolation. If we want to think about the pitch
of the word "you" in "Happy Birthday," we have to start back at "Happy," and sing through until we get to "you." In this way, a tune 
is sort of like a habit. Just like once you start tying your shoe, you're on automatic

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1845, the bright green
leaves of potato plants dotted the Irish countryside. For over 200 years, 
the South American vegetable had thrived in Ireland’s rough terrain
and unpredictable weather. Packed with carbohydrates,
vitamins, and minerals, the potato was a remarkably
nutrient-rich crop that made it easy for less wealthy
families to maintain a balanced diet. By the mid-19th century, potatoes had
supplanted other staple foods. And since British mandates ensured
Ireland’s more valuable agricultural products were exported, roughly half the country’s
8.5 million residents lived almost entirely on potatoes. But when harvesting began in 1845, farmers found their potatoes
blackened and shriveled. Those who ate them suffered severe
stomach cramps and even death. Today, we know the culprit was
Phytophthora infestans— a fungus that flourished in the season’s
unusually damp weather. But at the time it was simply
called “the blight.” The fungus likely originated
in the Americas, traveling across the Atlantic on ships. And while it destroyed potato harvests
across Europe, wealthier countries— then as today—
generally fared better, as they had more resources to draw on. Meanwhile, the southern and western
regions of Ireland were already impoverished
and entirely dependent on the single crop, making them disproportionately vulnerable. The impacts of food insecurity are often
most severe at the poverty line. But while the failed harvest
created a class crisis, the government's response turned
it into a national catastrophe. For centuries, Ireland had been
under varying degrees of English control, and by 1845,
it was part of the United Kingdom with its government based in London. During the famine’s first year, this distant ruling body imported corn
from North America and offered the Irish employment
on public works projects. But this relief only caused more problems. Imported food was poorly distributed
and offered insufficient nutrition, making the previously healthy population
more vulnerable to disease, and increasing maternal
and child mortality. Worse still, the British continued
to export Ireland’s grain and livestock. Meanwhile, the public works projects
required lengthy shifts of grueling manual labour and
were far from where most workers lived. For example, just one of countless tragic
incidences is the story of Thomas Malone, who walked 18 kilometers roundtrip
to work every day. One night, exhausted and starving, he collapsed and died
just before reaching home, leaving behind his wife and six children. Despite the year’s countless tragedies,
many families managed to scrape by. But in 1846, the damp weather returned
and the blight worsened, impacting 75% of Ireland's potato yield. British relief efforts diminished
substantially in the famine’s second year. And while international aid
helped save lives, the overall need was enormous. As the crisis wore on, the government
limited who was eligible for relief and tasked Ireland with funding the relief
efforts themselves by increasing local taxes. Most modern historians view these
disastrous policies as stemming from a mix
of toxic religious ideology, laissez-faire economic policies,
and political infighting. British news sources callously
depicted the Irish as lazy, simple-minded alcoholics, and some London decision-makers believed
the famine was God’s punishment for these sinful behaviors. Other government officials purposefully
blocked efforts to provide meaningful relief
due to internal political rivalries. As with famines and food insecurity today, it wasn't a lack of resources preventing
the British from aiding Ireland, but rather a lack of political will. Seven years after the blight began, Ireland’s weather patterns
returned to normal and the potato crop finally stabilised. But over 1 million people had perished
from starvation, malnutrition, and disease. Between 1 and 2 million more
fled the country, beginning a trend that dropped Ireland’s
population to half its pre-famine levels by the 1920s. Today, climate change is making
extreme weather more common and sustained, leading countless agricultural communities
to face similar struggles. Just as in Ireland,
farmers living on the margins are increasingly facing starvation,
malnutrition, and disease due to global weather patterns
for which they bear little responsibility. But history doesn’t have to repeat itself
if governments and institutions can provide the kind of aid
these regions need: relief efforts that are coordinated
and ongoing, provide sufficient nutrition
to prevent disease, and are offered with compassion
rather than judgment.

**Transcript**:
In the fall of 1845, the bright green
leaves of potato plants dotted the Irish countryside. For over 200 years, 
the South American vegetable had thrived in Ireland’s rough terrain
and unpredictable weather. Packed with carbohydrates,
vitamins, and minerals, the potato was a remarkably
nutrient-rich crop that made it easy for less wealthy
families to maintain a balanced diet. By the mid-19th century, potatoes had
supplanted other staple foods. And since British mandates ensured
Ireland’s more valuable agricultural products were exported, roughly half the country’s
8.5 million residents lived almost entirely on potatoes. But when harvesting began in 1845, farmers found their potatoes
blackened and shriveled. Those who ate them suffered severe
stomach cramps and even death. Today, we know the culprit was
Phytophthora infestans— a fungus that flourished in the season’s
unusually damp weather. But at the time it was simply
called “the blight.” The fungus likely originated
in the Americas, traveling across the Atlantic on ships. And while it destroyed potato harvests
across Europe, wealthier countries— then as today—
generally fared better, as they had more resources to draw on. Meanwhile, the southern and western
regions of Ireland were already impoverished
and entirely dependent on the single crop, making them disproportionately vulnerable. The impacts of food insecurity are often
most severe at the poverty line. But while the failed harvest
created a class crisis, the government's response turned
it into a national catastrophe. For centuries, Ireland had been
under varying degrees of English control, and by 1845,
it was part of the United Kingdom with its government based in London. During the famine’s first year, this distant ruling body imported corn
from North America and offered the Irish employment
on public works projects. But this relief only caused more problems. Imported food was poorly distributed
and offered insufficient nutrition, making the previously healthy population
more vulnerable to disease, and increasing maternal
and child mortality. Worse still, the British continued
to export Ireland’s grain and livestock. Meanwhile, the public works projects
required lengthy shifts of grueling manual labour and
were far from where most workers lived. For example, just one of countless tragic
incidences is the story of Thomas Malone, who walked 18 kilometers roundtrip
to work every day. One night, exhausted and starving, he collapsed and died
just before reaching home, leaving behind his wife and six children. Despite the year’s countless tragedies,
many families managed to scrape by. But in 1846, the damp weather returned
and the blight worsened, impacting 75% of Ireland's potato yield. British relief efforts diminished
substantially in the famine’s second year. And while international aid
helped save lives, the overall need was enormous. As the crisis wore on, the government
limited who was eligible for relief and tasked Ireland with funding the relief
efforts themselves by increasing local taxes. Most modern historians view these
disastrous policies as stemming from a mix
of toxic religious ideology, laissez-faire economic policies,
and political infighting. British news sources callously
depicted the Irish as lazy, simple-minded alcoholics, and some London decision-makers believed
the famine was God’s punishment for these sinful behaviors. Other government officials purposefully
blocked efforts to provide meaningful relief
due to internal political rivalries. As with famines and food insecurity today, it wasn't a lack of resources preventing
the British from aiding Ireland, but rather a lack of political will. Seven years after the blight began, Ireland’s weather patterns
returned to normal and the potato crop finally stabilised. But over 1 million people had perished
from starvation, malnutrition, and disease. Between 1 and 2 million more
fled the country, beginning a trend that dropped Ireland’s
population to half its pre-famine levels by the 1920s. Today, climate change is making
extreme weather more common and sustained, leading countless agricultural communities
to face similar struggles. Just as in Ireland,
farmers living on the margins are increasingly facing starvation,
malnutrition, and disease due to global weather patterns
for which they bear little responsibility. But history doesn’t have to repeat itself
if governments and institutions can provide the kind of aid
these regions need: relief efforts that are coordinated
and ongoing, provide sufficient nutrition
to prevent disease, and are offered with compassion
rather than judgment.

**Transcript**:
The vast, white ice surface of Antarctica stretches for over 3 million
square kilometers: empty, desolate,
and almost completely silent. But appearances can be deceiving. On the coast of this expanse, just a few meters beneath the ice
lies a multicolored constellation of life. This remarkably diverse realm is home
to over 8,000 species of sea denizens who rely on an arsenal
of otherworldly traits to survive. So how do these species not only live,
but thrive, in conditions most animals
would be unable to bear? Antarctic waters are some of the most
consistently frigid in the world, hovering below 0 degrees Celsius
for a large portion of the year. This means burning energy
too quickly can be deadly, so survival in this ecosystem
looks slow and steady. Freezing temperatures persist
even in the summer, but this season brings
a rare gift: sunlight. For a brief period, it’s abundant, shining through the ice
for 24 hours a day. This infusion of energy drives intense
coastal phytoplankton blooms, transforming the waters
into a thick green soup. Marine life both large and small
takes advantage of this bounty, including the giant Antarctic isopod. Cousins of the humble pill bug, these crustaceans can reach
up to 11 centimeters long, and they never miss the opportunity
for a meal. The scavengers eat a wide variety of prey,
including other giant isopods. And by slowing their metabolisms,
they can make this food last, with one study showing specimens surviving
for 50 days without eating. Since this adaptation involves careful
conservation of energy, giant isopods spend most of their time
stationary or inching across the seafloor. Meanwhile, their tiny amphipod relatives
celebrate the summer by releasing offspring
alongside the algal explosion, ensuring their young have
an abundance of food. And sea cucumbers carpeting the seafloor
hoover up the dense plankton with outstretched
tentacles, producing nutrient-rich feces
that nourish nearby life. But this big summer blowout
doesn’t last long. The first signs of autumn arrive
in fine needles of frazil ice. These slowly coagulating crystals
form a skin across the surface, then mix with falling snow
before freezing into a thin crust of ice. The waters get darker and colder. And in this swiftly dimming world, a set of long, spiky limbs
sidle into view. With up to six pairs of legs,
these giant sea spiders aren’t arachnids, but rather a related class of marine
arthropod unique to the seafloor. In addition to housing some
of the animal’s organs, its legs are covered in tiny holes, which grow more numerous
as the spider ages. These holes will likely help absorb
the dissolved oxygen that saturates these freezing
southern waters. Since oxygen fuels growth, many local species have evolved
to take advantage of this abundance, and it may be one of the reasons that
gigantism is so common in this region. Individual sea spiders, for instance,
can grow to the size of dinner plates. But soon, these underwater giants
will be moving slower than ever. As winter settles in,
the sea floor becomes even colder. Waters fall to negative
1.8 degrees Celsius. On the surface, the thin icy crust
thickens into a layer called nilas, and young sea ice starts forming
ridges that block out the sun. The ocean begins to mirror
the still landscape above it. Antarctic sea cucumbers and urchins
go into dormancy for months, and their metabolic rates fall
to the slowest on Earth. Antarctic limpets continue feeding, but at such a gradual pace that they're
largely still surviving on energy reserves from the summer. Tiny crustaceans survive off the traces
of algae growing on their home’s icy ceiling, raising their young in these expansive
winter nurseries. But this seemingly endless winter
won't last forever. As spring comes, light slowly begins
to trickle back down through the ice. And week by week, bit by bit, this underwater world will begin waking up to begin its delicate,
slow-motion dance once again.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The vast, white ice surface of Antarctica stretches for over 3 million
square kilometers: empty, desolate,
and almost completely silent. But appearances can be deceiving. On the coast of this expanse, just a few meters beneath the ice
lies a multicolored constellation of life. This remarkably diverse realm is home
to over 8,000 species of sea denizens who rely on an arsenal
of otherworldly traits to survive. So how do these species not only live,
but thrive, in conditions most animals
would be unable to bear? Antarctic waters are some of the most
consistently frigid in the world, hovering below 0 degrees Celsius
for a large portion of the year. This means burning energy
too quickly can be deadly, so survival in this ecosystem
looks slow and steady. Freezing temperatures persist
even in the summer, but this season brings
a rare gift: sunlight. For a brief period, it’s abundant, shining through the ice
for 24 hours a day. This infusion of energy drives intense
coastal phytoplankton blooms, transforming the waters
into a thick green soup. Marine life both large and small
takes advantage of this bounty, including the giant Antarctic isopod. Cousins of the humble pill bug, these crustaceans can reach
up to 11 centimeters long, and they never miss the opportunity
for a meal. The scavengers eat a wide variety of prey,
including other giant isopods. And by slowing their metabolisms,
they can make this food last, with one study showing specimens surviving
for 50 days without eating. Since this adaptation involves careful
conservation of energy, giant isopods spend most of their time
stationary or inching across the seafloor. Meanwhile, their tiny amphipod relatives
celebrate the summer by releasing offspring
alongside the algal explosion, ensuring their young have
an abundance of food. And sea cucumbers carpeting the seafloor
hoover up the dense plankton with outstretched
tentacles, producing nutrient-rich feces
that nourish nearby life. But this big summer blowout
doesn’t last long. The first signs of autumn arrive
in fine needles of frazil ice. These slowly coagulating crystals
form a skin across the surface, then mix with falling snow
before freezing into a thin crust of ice. The waters get darker and colder. And in this swiftly dimming world, a set of long, spiky limbs
sidle into view. With up to six pairs of legs,
these giant sea spiders aren’t arachnids, but rather a related class of marine
arthropod unique to the seafloor. In addition to housing some
of the animal’s organs, its legs are covered in tiny holes, which grow more numerous
as the spider ages. These holes will likely help absorb
the dissolved oxygen that saturates these freezing
southern waters. Since oxygen fuels growth, many local species have evolved
to take advantage of this abundance, and it may be one of the reasons that
gigantism is so common in this region. Individual sea spiders, for instance,
can grow to the size of dinner plates. But soon, these underwater giants
will be moving slower than ever. As winter settles in,
the sea floor becomes even colder. Waters fall to negative
1.8 degrees Celsius. On the surface, the thin icy crust
thickens into a layer called nilas, and young sea ice starts forming
ridges that block out the sun. The ocean begins to mirror
the still landscape above it. Antarctic sea cucumbers and urchins
go into dormancy for months, and their metabolic rates fall
to the slowest on Earth. Antarctic limpets continue feeding, but at such a gradual pace that they're
largely still surviving on energy reserves from the summer. Tiny crustaceans survive off the traces
of algae growing on their home’s icy ceiling, raising their young in these expansive
winter nurseries. But this seemingly endless winter
won't last forever. As spring comes, light slowly begins
to trickle back down through the ice. And week by week, bit by bit, this underwater world will begin waking up to begin its delicate,
slow-motion dance once again.

**Transcript**:
You’re peering into the Amazon River
when, suddenly, you lose your footing and fall. Piranhas dart about in the rapidly
approaching water. So, are you doomed? Will your fall trigger
a fatal feeding frenzy? To forecast your fate, let’s see
what we know about these fish. There are more than 30 piranha species. All live in the fresh waters
of South America and have a single row of sharp,
interlocking teeth on each jaw. They use their teeth in a variety of ways. Many are omnivorous and supplement diets
of things like insects, crustaceans, worms, and fish with fruits, seeds,
and other plant matter. Some, like red-bellied piranhas,
both hunt and scavenge. And others, like wimple piranhas,
have specific dietary predilections, almost exclusively going
after other fish’s scales. Species like redeye piranhas
are more solitary, while red-bellied piranhas
form shoals of 10 to 100. Red-bellied piranhas are among
the most popularly depicted and commonly regarded
as especially aggressive. However, their reputation for rapacious
pack hunting is misinformed. It’s thought that the main benefit
of their group-living isn’t cooperative hunting but instead protection from predators,
of which they have many. Larger, mature red-bellied piranhas
tend to assume privileged positions at the shoal’s center,
where it’s safest. And scientists have observed that
red-bellied piranhas in smaller groups breathe faster, probably because they’re more anxious. Interestingly, they also communicate. By rapidly contracting specialized muscles
above their swim bladders, they repeatedly “bark” when they’re facing
off with one another or when captured. They make thudding noises when they’re
aggressively circling each other, fighting, or competing for food. And when things escalate further, they chase each other
while snapping their jaws together. Researchers suspect that these sounds are just a sampling
of their overall repertoire, which might also have
some special uses during mating. But when do red-bellied piranhas
get aggressive with humans? Well, when they do bite people, it seems to mostly happen in scenarios
when they’re being handled; when people are spilling food or
cleaning their fishing catch in the water; or when people disturb piranhas
while the fish are mating or guarding their eggs
during the wet season. Starvation stress is also thought
to lead red-bellied piranhas to increasingly bold, aggressive behavior. And this could theoretically result
in feeding frenzies where each fish tries to get some
of whatever finds its way into the water. Despite this kind of behavior
being extremely rare, rumors of it launched the piranha’s
international infamy. And this was in no small part thanks
to former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1914, he published a bestselling book
in which he called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world” and wrote that the scent of blood
could incite them to rapidly devour an entire cow—
or human— alive. But Roosevelt’s account is generally
considered circumstantial and misleading. The “feeding frenzy” he witnessed is
suspected to have been the result of people purposefully starving
red-bellied piranhas, then giving them the opportunity
to feed on a cow carcass— all to put on an exciting show. But where were we?
Ah, yes. Falling into piranha-infested waters. So, what’s your fate? Let’s assume these are
red-bellied piranhas. This being the Amazon River, they should be doing alright
for themselves and not starving. Thankfully, you’re also not hitting
the water alongside a bunch of fish guts. And ideally, you're not disrupting
a piranha breeding extravaganza. You fall in, and the piranhas
most likely avoid you. Calmly, softly swimming or wading to shore
is generally recommended because splashing is thought
to attract piranhas. Indeed, they’re equipped
with the dentition to do damage, but they rarely attack humans. They usually have better things to eat. As you make your way onto dry land, there is no feeding frenzy where they
skeletonize your body within minutes. And upon exiting the water, you're probably pleased to find
no chunks of flesh missing.

of which they have many. Larger, mature red-bellied piranhas
tend to assume privileged positions at the shoal’s center,
where it’s safest. And scientists have observed that
red-bellied piranhas in smaller groups breathe faster, probably because they’re more anxious. Interestingly, they also communicate. By rapidly contracting specialized muscles
above their swim bladders, they repeatedly “bark” when they’re facing
off with one another or when captured. They make thudding noises when they’re
aggressively circling each other, fighting, or competing for food. And when things escalate further, they chase each other
while snapping their jaws together. Researchers suspect that these sounds are just a sampling
of their overall repertoire, which might also have
some special uses during mating. But when do red-bellied piranhas
get aggressive with humans? Well, when they do bite people, it seems to mostly happen in scenarios
when they’re being handled; when people are spilling food or
cleaning their fishing catch in the water; or when people disturb piranhas
while the fish are mating or guarding their eggs
during the wet season. Starvation stress is also thought
to lead red-bellied piranhas to increasingly bold, aggressive behavior. And this could theoretically result
in feeding frenzies where each fish tries to get some
of whatever finds its way into the water. Despite this kind of behavior
being extremely rare, rumors of it launched the piranha’s
international infamy. And this was in no small part thanks
to former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1914, he published a bestselling book
in which he called piranhas “the most ferocious fish in the world” and wrote that the scent of blood
could incite them to rapidly devour an entire cow—
or human— alive. But Roosevelt’s account is generally
considered circumstantial and misleading. The “feeding frenzy” he witnessed is
suspected to have been the result of people purposefully starving
red-bellied piranhas, then giving them the opportunity
to feed on a cow carcass— all to put on an exciting show. But where were we?
Ah, yes. Falling into piranha-infested waters. So, what’s your fate? Let’s assume these are
red-bellied piranhas. This being the Amazon River, they should be doing alright
for themselves and not starving. Thankfully, you’re also not hitting
the water alongside a bunch of fish guts. And ideally, you're not disrupting
a piranha breeding extravaganza. You fall in, and the piranhas
most likely avoid you. Calmly, softly swimming or wading to shore
is generally recommended because splashing is thought
to attract piranhas. Indeed, they’re equipped
with the dentition to do damage, but they rarely attack humans. They usually have better things to eat. As you make your way onto dry land, there is no feeding frenzy where they
skeletonize your body within minutes. And upon exiting the water, you're probably pleased to find
no chunks of flesh missing.

**Transcript**:
You’re peering into the Amazon River
when, suddenly, you lose your footing and fall. Piranhas dart about in the rapidly
approaching water. So, are you doomed? Will your fall trigger
a fatal feeding frenzy? To forecast your fate, let’s see
what we know about these fish. There are more than 30 piranha species. All live in the fresh waters
of South America and have a single row of sharp,
interlocking teeth on each jaw. They use their teeth in a variety of ways. Many are omnivorous and supplement diets
of things like insects, crustaceans, worms, and fish with fruits, seeds,
and other plant matter. Some, like red-bellied piranhas,
both hunt and scavenge. And others, like wimple piranhas,
have specific dietary predilections, almost exclusively going
after other fish’s scales. Species like redeye piranhas
are more solitary, while red-bellied piranhas
form shoals of 10 to 100. Red-bellied piranhas are among
the most popularly depicted and commonly regarded
as especially aggressive. However, their reputation for rapacious
pack hunting is misinformed. It’s thought that the main benefit
of their group-living isn’t cooperative hunting but instead protection from predators,
of which they have many. Larger, mature red-bellied piranhas

**Transcript**:
Ah, spring. As Demeter, goddess of the harvest,
it’s your favorite season. Humans and animals look to you to balance
the bounty of the natural world, which, like any self-respecting goddess,
you do with a pair of magical dice. Every day you roll the dice at dawn, and all lands that match the sum
of the two dice produce their resources. The resulting frequency of sums
across the season keeps your land in perfect harmony;
any other rates would spell ruin. And that’s why it was particularly rotten
when Loki, the Norse trickster god, invaded your land and cursed your dice,
causing all the dots to fall off. When you try to reaffix them, you find that one die won’t accept
more than four dots on any of its sides, though the other has no such constraint. You can use Hephaestus’ furnace to seal
the dots in place before the sun rises, but once sealed you can’t move
or remove them again. How can you craft your dice so that,
when rolled and summed, every total comes up with
the exact same frequency as it would with standard 6-sided dice? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Normal dice can roll any sum from 2 to 12, but sums in the middle tend to come
up more frequently than ones on the ends. We can see the odds of rolling any sum
by making a table, with all the possibilities for one die
represented on the top, and those for the other on the side. The table lets us see at a glance
that there are six ways to roll a 7, but only two ways to roll a 3. This also gives us an approach
to crafting our new set of dice. Matching the original sum frequencies
means that the locations of the sums in this table may change, but the numbers and quantities
of each sum must stay the same. In other words, there still must be
exactly one 2, two 3s, and so on. To start, we’ve got to roll that 2, and since we have to use
positive, whole numbers, there’s only one choice: 
each die needs a 1 on it. What else do we know? Assuming we have a 4— the highest
number possible— on the cursed die, the other one would need an 8
in order to have one way to roll 12. In fact, we know we require a single 1
and a single 4 on the cursed die, or we’d have too many ways
to roll a 2 or a 12. So the cursed dies remaining four sides
must have a mix of 2s and 3s. If we have three or four 2s, 
we can roll the sum 3 too many ways. Similarly, if we have three or four 3s,
we’d get the sum 11 too often. So the only possibility is for the
cursed die to have two 2s and two 3s. With one die completed, we should be able to figure out the
missing values on the second. First, we need one more way
to make 10 and 4, so we must have one 3 and one 6. We now need one more way
to make 5 and 9. That forces us to choose 4 and 5
for the final sides. Fill them in, and lo and behold, we have a distribution table where
every possible sum shows up the same number of times
as with our original dice! The discovery of these dice was made
in 1978 by George Sicherman, which is why they’re referred
to as “Sicherman dice.” Incredibly, this is the only alternate
way to make two 6-sided dice with the same distribution of sums
as standard dice. You send the dice to be reforged,
confident that you’ve averted disaster. Now it’s time to repay the Norse gods
with a gift of your own.

**Transcript**:
Since the launch of the first
artificial satellite in 1957, governments, companies,
and research institutions have been planting flags among the stars. But while it might seem like there's
plenty of room in this vast expanse, some pieces of celestial real estate
are more valuable than others. Each of these dots is a Lagrange point, and as far as human space exploration
is concerned, they may be the most important places
in our solar system. Named after the 18th century mathematician
who deduced their positions, Lagrange points are rare places
of equilibrium in our constantly shifting universe. All celestial bodies exert
a gravitational force on nearby objects, pulling them in and out of orbits. And gravity acts alongside several
apparent forces to determine what those orbits look like. However, Lagrange points are places
where all these forces balance out. So if we place a relatively
low mass object here, it will maintain a constant distance
from the massive bodies pulling on it. Essentially, Lagrange points are
celestial parking spaces— once an object is there, it requires
little to no energy to stay put. So whenever humans want to keep
an object in one place for a long time without using tons of fuel, it needs to be orbiting a Lagrange point. However, there are only so many
of these parking spots. Pairs of massive bodies
in our solar system generate sets of five Lagrange points. This means our Sun has
five points with every planet, and our planets have five points
with each of their moons. Adding these up, there are over 1,000
Lagrange points in our solar system— but only a few are useful
for human purposes. Many are in locations that are
too difficult to reach or simply not very useful. And for reasons we'll explain in a bit,
many others are unstable. Currently, only two of these points
are heavily used by humans. But we’ll likely use many
more in the future— making these limited points
exclusive real estate. Which begs the question:
what exactly should we park in them? That answer depends
on where each point is. Consider the five Lagrange points
generated by the Sun and the Earth. L1 is located inside Earth's orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers
away from the planet. With this panoramic view of the Sun,
unobstructed by Earth’s shadow, L1 is the perfect place
for solar-observing satellites. L2 is at the same distance from Earth
but outside its orbit and shielded from the Sun, making it the perfect spot
to observe outer space. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope
went online here, in a spot where the Sun and Earth
only occupy a tiny fraction of the sky. L3 is in a particularly
mysterious location that can never be directly observed
from Earth’s surface. This has made L3 a frequent locale
in science fiction, though it hasn’t offered much use
to scientists yet. L4 and L5, however, are a bit different
from their siblings. In every set of five, the first three
Lagrange points are slightly unstable. This means objects will slowly drift
away from them, though keeping what we’ve parked there
in place is still energetically cheap. The stability of L4 and L5, however,
varies from set to set. If the heavier of the two bodies
generating the points has less than 25 times the mass
of the lighter body, these points are too unstable
to park things in. However, if the heavier body is massive
enough— like it is in Sun-Earth set— then the relevant forces will always
return objects to these equilibrium points, making them our most stable parking spots. That’s why points like these
naturally accumulate space objects, such as the Sun-Jupiter set’s L4 and L5,
which host thousands of asteroids. Every Lagrange point in our solar system
has its quirks. Some might be perfect for scavenging
construction materials from drifting asteroids. Others might make ideal gas stations
for ships headed to deep space, or even host entire human colonies. These points are already home
to advanced technological achievements, but soon, they could become
our stepping stones to the stars.

low mass object here, it will maintain a constant distance
from the massive bodies pulling on it. Essentially, Lagrange points are
celestial parking spaces— once an object is there, it requires
little to no energy to stay put. So whenever humans want to keep
an object in one place for a long time without using tons of fuel, it needs to be orbiting a Lagrange point. However, there are only so many
of these parking spots. Pairs of massive bodies
in our solar system generate sets of five Lagrange points. This means our Sun has
five points with every planet, and our planets have five points
with each of their moons. Adding these up, there are over 1,000
Lagrange points in our solar system— but only a few are useful
for human purposes. Many are in locations that are
too difficult to reach or simply not very useful. And for reasons we'll explain in a bit,
many others are unstable. Currently, only two of these points
are heavily used by humans. But we’ll likely use many
more in the future— making these limited points
exclusive real estate. Which begs the question:
what exactly should we park in them? That answer depends
on where each point is. Consider the five Lagrange points
generated by the Sun and the Earth. L1 is located inside Earth's orbit, about 1.5 million kilometers
away from the planet. With this panoramic view of the Sun,
unobstructed by Earth’s shadow, L1 is the perfect place
for solar-observing satellites. L2 is at the same distance from Earth
but outside its orbit and shielded from the Sun, making it the perfect spot
to observe outer space. In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope
went online here, in a spot where the Sun and Earth
only occupy a tiny fraction of the sky. L3 is in a particularly
mysterious location that can never be directly observed
from Earth’s surface. This has made L3 a frequent locale
in science fiction, though it hasn’t offered much use
to scientists yet. L4 and L5, however, are a bit different
from their siblings. In every set of five, the first three
Lagrange points are slightly unstable. This means objects will slowly drift
away from them, though keeping what we’ve parked there
in place is still energetically cheap. The stability of L4 and L5, however,
varies from set to set. If the heavier of the two bodies
generating the points has less than 25 times the mass
of the lighter body, these points are too unstable
to park things in. However, if the heavier body is massive
enough— like it is in Sun-Earth set— then the relevant forces will always
return objects to these equilibrium points, making them our most stable parking spots. That’s why points like these
naturally accumulate space objects, such as the Sun-Jupiter set’s L4 and L5,
which host thousands of asteroids. Every Lagrange point in our solar system
has its quirks. Some might be perfect for scavenging
construction materials from drifting asteroids. Others might make ideal gas stations
for ships headed to deep space, or even host entire human colonies. These points are already home
to advanced technological achievements, but soon, they could become
our stepping stones to the stars.

**Transcript**:
Right now, invisible signals are flying
through the air all around you. Beyond the spectrum of light
your eyes can see, massive radio waves as wide as houses carry information between computers,
GPS systems, cell phones, and more. In fact, the signal your phone broadcasts
is so strong, if your eyes could see radio waves, your phone would be visible from Jupiter. At least your special eyes would be able
to see this if the sky wasn’t flooded with interference
from routers, satellites, and, of course, people flying who haven't put their
phones on airplane mode. You see, this setting isn't
to protect your flight, it's to protect everyone else
in your flight path. Cell phones connect to networks
by emitting information in the form of electromagnetic waves; specifically, radio waves, which occupy this band of the
electromagnetic spectrum. These radio waves come
in a range of wavelengths, and let’s imagine your special eyes
see the various wavelengths as different colors. When you make a call,
your phone generates a radio wave signal which it throws to the nearest cell tower. If you're far from service, your phone will expend more battery power
to send a higher amplitude signal in an effort to make a connection. Once connected, this signal is relayed
between cell towers all the way to your call’s recipient. Since your call isn’t the only
signal out here, cell towers managing the calls assign
each phones involved their own wavelength. This specific color ensures you’re not
picking up other people’s calls. It’s even slightly different
from the wavelength your phone is receiving information on, so as not to interfere
with that incoming signal. But there are only so many
colors to choose from. And since the advent of Wi-Fi, the demand for ownership of these
wavelengths has increased dramatically. With all these signals in the air and
a limited number of colors to assign, avoiding interference is
increasingly difficult. Especially when cell towers receive
too many signals at once, such as during regional emergencies, when
everyone's trying to use their phones. But other sources of interference
are more preventable, like phones searching for signals
from thousands of meters in the sky. Phones on planes are very
far from cell towers, so they work overtime to send
the loudest signals they can in search of service. But since planes travel so quickly, the phones might find themselves much
closer to a cell tower than expected— blasting it with a massive signal
that drowns out those on the ground. So when you fly without
using airplane mode, you’re essentially acting
as a military radio jammer— sending out giant radio waves 
that interfere with nearby signals. Even on the ground, almost all our
electronics emit rogue radio waves, slowing down our internet
and making our calls choppy. This leads consumers to pay
for more bandwidth, pushing service providers to take
over more of the radio spectrum, and eventually, send more satellites
into the sky— creating a vicious cycle that could
eventually blot out the stars. Though, even without these satellites, this system is threatening
our relationship with the cosmos. Radio telescopes used for astronomy rely on a specific band of wavelengths
to see deep into space. However, while this range
is supposedly protected, the cutoffs aren’t enforced. For example, the Very Large Array can see
signals throughout our solar system from 1 to 50 GHz. But if it tries looking for signals
below 5 GHz, its search could be drowned
out by a sea of phones on 5G networks. Today, nowhere on Earth
is truly radio quiet. Satellites relaying signals
around the globe have blanketed the planet in radio waves. But there are a few places
with less crowded skies, where radio telescopes
can look deep into space. Here, we can see the black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, and uncover the secrets of galaxies
up to 96 billion light years away. Well, so long as we’re
not blinded by phones sending signals from first class.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Right now, invisible signals are flying
through the air all around you. Beyond the spectrum of light
your eyes can see, massive radio waves as wide as houses carry information between computers,
GPS systems, cell phones, and more. In fact, the signal your phone broadcasts
is so strong, if your eyes could see radio waves, your phone would be visible from Jupiter. At least your special eyes would be able
to see this if the sky wasn’t flooded with interference
from routers, satellites, and, of course, people flying who haven't put their
phones on airplane mode. You see, this setting isn't
to protect your flight, it's to protect everyone else
in your flight path. Cell phones connect to networks
by emitting information in the form of electromagnetic waves; specifically, radio waves, which occupy this band of the
electromagnetic spectrum. These radio waves come
in a range of wavelengths, and let’s imagine your special eyes
see the various wavelengths as different colors. When you make a call,
your phone generates a radio wave signal which it throws to the nearest cell tower. If you're far from service, your phone will expend more battery power
to send a higher amplitude signal in an effort to make a connection. Once connected, this signal is relayed
between cell towers all the way to your call’s recipient. Since your call isn’t the only
signal out here, cell towers managing the calls assign
each phones involved their own wavelength. This specific color ensures you’re not
picking up other people’s calls. It’s even slightly different
from the wavelength your phone is receiving information on, so as not to interfere
with that incoming signal. But there are only so many
colors to choose from. And since the advent of Wi-Fi, the demand for ownership of these
wavelengths has increased dramatically. With all these signals in the air and
a limited number of colors to assign, avoiding interference is
increasingly difficult. Especially when cell towers receive
too many signals at once, such as during regional emergencies, when
everyone's trying to use their phones. But other sources of interference
are more preventable, like phones searching for signals
from thousands of meters in the sky. Phones on planes are very
far from cell towers, so they work overtime to send
the loudest signals they can in search of service. But since planes travel so quickly, the phones might find themselves much
closer to a cell tower than expected— blasting it with a massive signal
that drowns out those on the ground. So when you fly without
using airplane mode, you’re essentially acting
as a military radio jammer— sending out giant radio waves 
that interfere with nearby signals. Even on the ground, almost all our
electronics emit rogue radio waves, slowing down our internet
and making our calls choppy. This leads consumers to pay
for more bandwidth, pushing service providers to take
over more of the radio spectrum, and eventually, send more satellites
into the sky— creating a vicious cycle that could
eventually blot out the stars. Though, even without these satellites, this system is threatening
our relationship with the cosmos. Radio telescopes used for astronomy rely on a specific band of wavelengths
to see deep into space. However, while this range
is supposedly protected, the cutoffs aren’t enforced. For example, the Very Large Array can see
signals throughout our solar system from 1 to 50 GHz. But if it tries looking for signals
below 5 GHz, its search could be drowned
out by a sea of phones on 5G networks. Today, nowhere on Earth
is truly radio quiet. Satellites relaying signals
around the globe have blanketed the planet in radio waves. But there are a few places
with less crowded skies, where radio telescopes
can look deep into space. Here, we can see the black hole
at the center of the Milky Way, and uncover the secrets of galaxies
up to 96 billion light years away. Well, so long as we’re
not blinded by phones sending signals from first class.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A drop of gasoline, a match,
and a battery, all store energy— but, after each expends its energy,
only the battery is recyclable. That's because, chemically speaking, a dead battery is actually not
that different from a fresh one. Most of the batteries we use
today take advantage of the fact that some metals like
to release electrons and others like to accept them. For example, in a typical
alkaline double-A battery, zinc metal reacts with hydroxide ions, changing into zinc oxide and releasing
electrons at the negative terminal. The electrons travel through, say,
a light bulb, and then return to the battery
at the positive terminal, where they’re accepted
by manganese dioxide. Different batteries use different
combinations of metals, and sometimes non-metals like graphite, but the basic idea is to use
a pair of chemical reactions to generate a stream of electrons. Almost all batteries,
even single-use batteries, are theoretically rechargeable. That's because the metals and other
chemicals are still right there. That’s very different than in,
say, gasoline, where the liquid hydrocarbon molecules
are converted to gases. You can't convert exhaust
back into gasoline, but, with some work you can convert,
say, zinc oxide back to zinc. So then what's the difference
between these and these? The short answer is that trying
to recharge a single-use battery doesn’t just force these reactions
to run in reverse. It also results in a bunch of side
reactions that produce useless contaminants, reducing a battery’s capacity; and it could even damage
the internal structure of the battery, leading to a loss of electrical contact
and failure. Rechargeable batteries are engineered
to avoid these issues. Look at this lithium-ion battery. Both sides have an atomic-level structure
that you can imagine as lots of docks. So when the battery is powering something, the lithium “ships” give up their
electrons to power the circuit, and then sail over to the other side
of the battery, dock in an orderly, organized way, and meet up with their
now-lower-energy electrons. When the battery is being charged,
the opposite happens. Over the course of hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of charge cycles, some of the lithium ion ships
sort of veer off course and engage in side reactions, producing stuff that increases
the internal resistance of the battery, which in turn makes it lose
efficiency and power until it inevitably dies. Even when that happens,
you can bring dead batteries back to life— whether they’re rechargeable or not—
by recycling them. The heart of most battery recycling
is a process called smelting, which is basically just melting
the metallic parts. This drives off impurities, returning metals back to their
initial, orderly state. Unfortunately, in many countries you can’t
just toss household batteries in with your regular recycling. You have to take them to a battery
collection point or recycling center. Same goes for more complicated
rechargeable batteries: you need to bring them
to a collection point or send them back to the company
you bought them from. It’s a pain, but absolutely
worth the time and effort, because recycling batteries is critical. Not only does it prevent
potentially toxic battery metals from leaking into the environment, it conserves scarce— and vital— resources. Earth has about 22 million tons
of lithium— enough for about 2.5 billion EVs. That sounds like plenty, but it’s only
25% higher than the number of EVs experts believe it’ll take to reach
net zero emissions by 2050, and that doesn’t even account for laptops,
phones, and anything else that uses a lithium-ion battery. Currently, though, most lithium-ion
batteries are not manufactured with recycling in mind. The designs are intricate
and non-standard, and the components are held together
by almost indestructible glues. So today, less than 5% of lithium-ion
batteries are recycled. Regulations that clearly define
who is responsible for a spent battery and what should happen to it
can boost recycling dramatically. For example, lead-acid batteries are
generally subject to stringent regulations and are recycled at much higher rates
than lithium-ion batteries. Over the next century, we’ll need
to recycle huge numbers of EV batteries, so scientists are working on making
the battery recycling process cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Smelting uses a lot of energy and,
depending on the type of battery, can release harmful by-products. In addition to regulations, industrial
processes, and our own individual choices, battery tech will also continue to evolve. There are proof-of-concept batteries
being developed that can convert physical force, ambient sound,
and even pee into electricity. But if your top priority is to make your
number one source of power, number one, sorry to say, but urine for a long wait.

**Transcript**:
A drop of gasoline, a match,
and a battery, all store energy— but, after each expends its energy,
only the battery is recyclable. That's because, chemically speaking, a dead battery is actually not
that different from a fresh one. Most of the batteries we use
today take advantage of the fact that some metals like
to release electrons and others like to accept them. For example, in a typical
alkaline double-A battery, zinc metal reacts with hydroxide ions, changing into zinc oxide and releasing
electrons at the negative terminal. The electrons travel through, say,
a light bulb, and then return to the battery
at the positive terminal, where they’re accepted
by manganese dioxide. Different batteries use different
combinations of metals, and sometimes non-metals like graphite, but the basic idea is to use
a pair of chemical reactions to generate a stream of electrons. Almost all batteries,
even single-use batteries, are theoretically rechargeable. That's because the metals and other
chemicals are still right there. That’s very different than in,
say, gasoline, where the liquid hydrocarbon molecules
are converted to gases. You can't convert exhaust
back into gasoline, but, with some work you can convert,
say, zinc oxide back to zinc. So then what's the difference
between these and these? The short answer is that trying
to recharge a single-use battery doesn’t just force these reactions
to run in reverse. It also results in a bunch of side
reactions that produce useless contaminants, reducing a battery’s capacity; and it could even damage
the internal structure of the battery, leading to a loss of electrical contact
and failure. Rechargeable batteries are engineered
to avoid these issues. Look at this lithium-ion battery. Both sides have an atomic-level structure
that you can imagine as lots of docks. So when the battery is powering something, the lithium “ships” give up their
electrons to power the circuit, and then sail over to the other side
of the battery, dock in an orderly, organized way, and meet up with their
now-lower-energy electrons. When the battery is being charged,
the opposite happens. Over the course of hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of charge cycles, some of the lithium ion ships
sort of veer off course and engage in side reactions, producing stuff that increases
the internal resistance of the battery, which in turn makes it lose
efficiency and power until it inevitably dies. Even when that happens,
you can bring dead batteries back to life— whether they’re rechargeable or not—
by recycling them. The heart of most battery recycling
is a process called smelting, which is basically just melting
the metallic parts. This drives off impurities, returning metals back to their
initial, orderly state. Unfortunately, in many countries you can’t
just toss household batteries in with your regular recycling. You have to take them to a battery
collection point or recycling center. Same goes for more complicated
rechargeable batteries: you need to bring them
to a collection point or send them back to the company
you bought them from. It’s a pain, but absolutely
worth the time and effort, because recycling batteries is critical. Not only does it prevent
potentially toxic battery metals from leaking into the environment, it conserves scarce— and vital— resources. Earth has about 22 million tons
of lithium— enough for about 2.5 billion EVs. That sounds like plenty, but it’s only
25% higher than the number of EVs experts believe it’ll take to reach
net zero emissions by 2050, and that doesn’t even account for laptops,
phones, and anything else that uses a lithium-ion battery. Currently, though, most lithium-ion
batteries are not manufactured with recycling in mind. The designs are intricate
and non-standard, and the components are held together
by almost indestructible glues. So today, less than 5% of lithium-ion
batteries are recycled. Regulations that clearly define
who is responsible for a spent battery and what should happen to it
can boost recycling dramatically. For example, lead-acid batteries are
generally subject to stringent regulations and are recycled at much higher rates
than lithium-ion batteries. Over the next century, we’ll need
to recycle huge numbers of EV batteries, so scientists are working on making
the battery recycling process cheaper and more environmentally friendly. Smelting uses a lot of energy and,
depending on the type of battery, can release harmful by-products. In addition to regulations, industrial
processes, and our own individual choices, battery tech will also continue to evolve. There are proof-of-concept batteries
being developed that can convert physical force, ambient sound,
and even pee into electricity. But if your top priority is to make your
number one source of power, number one, sorry to say, but urine for a long wait.

**Transcript**:
10th century jester Jing Xinmo may have overstepped
when he got chased by a dog, then teasingly told the Chinese emperor that he shouldn’t let his kids
go around biting people. The emperor took offense
and trained an arrow on Jing. But instead of begging for his life,
Jing cracked another joke. Luckily, this pun landed—
so the emperor’s arrow did not. Contrary to common belief, jesters weren't just a medieval
European phenomenon, but flourished 
in other times and cultures. The first reliably recorded jester
is thought to be You Shi, of 7th century BCE China. He declared that, as a jester,
his words could not give offense. This privilege was important
to the jester’s position— but was sometimes violated. Jesters had unique relationships to power: they could be viewed as objects of mockery and also as entertainers
and trusted companions. People became jesters by various routes. They could be appointed due to physical
or neurological differences, plucked from a pool of entertainers,
or recruited by a traveling courtier. Such was the case when a royal servant wrote King Henry VIII’s chief minister
in the 1530s. He recommended a young boy to replace
the king’s aging jester, Sexten, with the assurance that he’d be much more
pleasant than Sexten ever was. Some jesters boasted unique talents,
like Roland the Farter, of Henry II’s 12th Century court. Every Christmas,
he performed a special routine, the finale of which was
a simultaneous jump, whistle, and fart. Additionally, jesters could influence
important decisions. For example,
if the clowns of the Tübatulabal nation of the Sierra Nevada mountains thought a chief was leading poorly, they could apparently
get the elders to appoint a new one. And, of course, Jing Xinmo knew
how to sway the Chinese emperor. A local magistrate once requested
that the emperor stop trampling farmland during his hunting sprees. Infuriated, the emperor
had the magistrate hauled before him. Jing facetiously suggested that
the magistrate be put to death immediately and that the emperor
let the peasants starve instead of harvesting the land
and paying taxes, all so he could gallop about freely. Presumably seeing the absurdity
of his own behavior, the emperor laughed 
and pardoned the magistrate. In 1596, a French man
was condemned to death. But Mathurine, one of the relatively few
female jesters on record, intervened in return for payment. With her help, the man’s wife
successfully pleaded with King Henry IV for her husband’s life. Although rare, jesters were
sometimes fired or even killed for taking their mockery or criticism
too far. In 1638, Scottish jester Archy Armstrong worsened his already
contentious relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop had recently revised
the Scottish Book of Common Prayer— an act that garnered strong opposition
and incited riots. Taking the opportunity
to further humiliate him, Archy asked the Archbishop,
“Who’s the fool now?” For which he was banished from the court. Three years later,
after the Archbishop’s arrest, a pamphlet began circulating
that ridiculed him, which was said to be the work
of none other than Archy. Meanwhile, some jesters openly mocked
their royal bosses without consequence. 11th century Persian jester Talhak
suggested the sultan was a cuckold, implying his wife was unfaithful to him. One day, as the sultan rested
his head on Talhak’s knee, he is said to have inquired,
“What is your relation to cuckolds?” To which Talhak replied,
“I am their pillow.” And when 19th century Persian shah asked
whether there was a food shortage, jester Karim Shir’ei joked, “Yes, I see Your Majesty is eating
only five times a day.” Even when rulers were considered
divinely appointed, some jesters managed to speak truth
directly to power, and reveal— in so many riddles,
jokes, or skits— who the real fools were.

and trusted companions. People became jesters by various routes. They could be appointed due to physical
or neurological differences, plucked from a pool of entertainers,
or recruited by a traveling courtier. Such was the case when a royal servant wrote King Henry VIII’s chief minister
in the 1530s. He recommended a young boy to replace
the king’s aging jester, Sexten, with the assurance that he’d be much more
pleasant than Sexten ever was. Some jesters boasted unique talents,
like Roland the Farter, of Henry II’s 12th Century court. Every Christmas,
he performed a special routine, the finale of which was
a simultaneous jump, whistle, and fart. Additionally, jesters could influence
important decisions. For example,
if the clowns of the Tübatulabal nation of the Sierra Nevada mountains thought a chief was leading poorly, they could apparently
get the elders to appoint a new one. And, of course, Jing Xinmo knew
how to sway the Chinese emperor. A local magistrate once requested
that the emperor stop trampling farmland during his hunting sprees. Infuriated, the emperor
had the magistrate hauled before him. Jing facetiously suggested that
the magistrate be put to death immediately and that the emperor
let the peasants starve instead of harvesting the land
and paying taxes, all so he could gallop about freely. Presumably seeing the absurdity
of his own behavior, the emperor laughed 
and pardoned the magistrate. In 1596, a French man
was condemned to death. But Mathurine, one of the relatively few
female jesters on record, intervened in return for payment. With her help, the man’s wife
successfully pleaded with King Henry IV for her husband’s life. Although rare, jesters were
sometimes fired or even killed for taking their mockery or criticism
too far. In 1638, Scottish jester Archy Armstrong worsened his already
contentious relationship with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The Archbishop had recently revised
the Scottish Book of Common Prayer— an act that garnered strong opposition
and incited riots. Taking the opportunity
to further humiliate him, Archy asked the Archbishop,
“Who’s the fool now?” For which he was banished from the court. Three years later,
after the Archbishop’s arrest, a pamphlet began circulating
that ridiculed him, which was said to be the work
of none other than Archy. Meanwhile, some jesters openly mocked
their royal bosses without consequence. 11th century Persian jester Talhak
suggested the sultan was a cuckold, implying his wife was unfaithful to him. One day, as the sultan rested
his head on Talhak’s knee, he is said to have inquired,
“What is your relation to cuckolds?” To which Talhak replied,
“I am their pillow.” And when 19th century Persian shah asked
whether there was a food shortage, jester Karim Shir’ei joked, “Yes, I see Your Majesty is eating
only five times a day.” Even when rulers were considered
divinely appointed, some jesters managed to speak truth
directly to power, and reveal— in so many riddles,
jokes, or skits— who the real fools were.

10th century jester Jing Xinmo may have overstepped
when he got chased by a dog, then teasingly told the Chinese emperor that he shouldn’t let his kids
go around biting people. The emperor took offense

Jing cracked another joke. Luckily, this pun landed—
so the emperor’s arrow did not. Contrary to common belief, jesters weren't just a medieval
European phenomenon, but flourished 
in other times and cultures. The first reliably recorded jester
