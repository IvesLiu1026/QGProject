**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, the most similar generated MCQ would be one that discusses aperture. 

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the one that talks about aperture. However, it doesn't specifically ask about the measurement unit of aperture.

Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. But if I had to choose one based on the topic of aperture, I would say that a new MCQ should be generated that specifically asks about the measurement unit of aperture.

However, if I had to choose one from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 3 is the closest in terms of topic, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ.

If you want me to choose an index, I would say that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match, but the closest one in terms of topic would be Question 3, with the understanding that it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 3, with the understanding that it does not match the ground truth MCQ)

**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

Using shape-shifting technology, B. Using weight-shifting technology, C. Using augmented reality, D. Using virtual reality.

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it does not ask about how the weight moves around the device. But among the given options, it is the closest match because it mentions "weight-shifting technology" which is related to the concept of the weight-shifting mobile phone.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about how the weight-shifting mobile phone works, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 2, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

However, if we were to modify Question 3 to "How does the weight-shifting mobile device work?" Options: A. The phone rotates from left to right, B. The gravitational center in the phone shifts, C. The phone expands in length and width, D. The phone vibrates to simulate weight gain, then this would be a perfect match.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Sarcophagus, a stone coffin typically adorned with decorative carvings or inscriptions. The history of the word sarcophagus is so skin-crawlingly grotesque, it seems to come right out of a low-budget horror film. Rather than having
a B-movie origin, however, its roots can be traced back
to the early Roman Empire where the Greek word sarkophagus was used to describe the limestone that a coffin was made of, not the coffin itself. According to the Roman
scholar Pliny the Elder, citizens of the Empire believed that limestone from a quarry near Troy would dissolve flesh. For this reason, it was quite desireable in the construction of coffins. Though it's unclear
if the belief was widespread or even accurately reported by Pliny, what is certain is that sarkophagus came from the Greek words sark, meaning flesh, and phagein, a verb meaning to eat. From flesh-eating stone to stone coffin, it's a fitting etymology for the final resting
place of the deceased.

Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but it shares some similarities with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the common symptoms of sleep paralysis, and the correct option includes hallucination of an evil spirit, chest pressure, and a feeling of floating.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 8, which asks about the sensation that people often experience during an episode of sleep paralysis. Although it does not ask about multiple symptoms like the ground truth MCQ, one of the options (B) mentions a feeling of pressure on the chest or suffocation, which is similar to the chest pressure mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ. Additionally, another option (A) mentions a feeling of floating, which is also mentioned in the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ, and Question 8 is the closest match based on the content and options.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 9 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions address the physical sensations experienced during sleep paralysis, specifically the shortness of breath and gasping for air. The correct answer for Question 9 (C) is also related to the correct answer for the ground truth MCQ (B), as both involve the brain being awake while the body is in an REM sleep state, leading to a struggle for air.

However, it's worth noting that the options for Question 9 do not exactly match the options for the ground truth MCQ. If a more similar generated MCQ existed, it would likely have options that more closely match the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, "tip of the iceberg." Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 1. 

Although Question 1 does not directly ask about the term "tip of the iceberg," it addresses the concept that the majority of an iceberg's mass is hidden under the surface of the water, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer to Question 1, "The density of pure ice is less than that of sea water," explains why icebergs have most of their bulk hidden beneath the water, which is closely related to the concept of the "tip of the iceberg."

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2: What is the main difference between sea ice or pack ice and glaciers?

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the concept of glaciers and their characteristics. Although the question is not an exact match, it is the closest one in terms of content and intent.

However, I noticed that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the definition of a glacier, which is the main focus of the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that directly asks about the definition of a glacier, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would select Question 2 as the most similar one.

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history that the Moon is at just
the right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used. The eclipse might put the Sun to shame, but even a shamed Sun can seriously damage your eyes.

In this short video, we're going to show you how we use two different animation techniques, both rotoscoping and traditional hand-drawn animation in the TED-Ed Lesson, "Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry: A Lesson of Transformation." A poetry slam is a competition in which poets are judged on their poems, often for qualities of emotional power and lyrical resonance. Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves
through spoken words, a Lesson, which offers
a guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great
example of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th
grade writing class, struggling with the assignment
of having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated
by rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing
of live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right
into pre-production. In animation, pre-production
is the planning stage. It's all the decisions
that need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors
and camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine
how much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot
of time down the road. For our project, a storyboard
was first created, in which the framing,
composition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie
of the storyboard. This helped us figure
out the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything
would flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots,
we first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had
in our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines
two or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing
and motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary
negative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots
were then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective
at the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion
of the animation was all planned out by the animator
ahead of time. An appropriate number
of drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then
plotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. "Mama's lies are footsteps
too many to count making excuses on black snow." Animation's a medium that's also
uniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect
of experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques
for the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey
in a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about Gayle Danley's profession, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to animation techniques, poetry slams, and the creative process.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of the TED-Ed Lesson, I would say that Question 2 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that specifically ask about Gayle Danley's profession or role in the TED-Ed Lesson. 

If you'd like, I can try to generate new MCQs that match the ground truth MCQ more closely.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the animation style that was not used in the video, with options including traditional animation, rotoscoping, claymation, and all of the above. The correct answer is claymation.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most related to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the two animation techniques used in the TED-Ed Lesson. Although it does not directly ask about the animation style that was not used, it provides information about the techniques that were used, which could be used to infer the answer to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 1 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Fizzle, to end weakly or to fail, to die out. The definition of fizzle likely links back to the Old English word fist, which meant stink. In the mid-fifteenth century, fist developed into the verb fisten, to break wind, which eventually lead to the modern word feisty, but that's another story. In its earliest form, as a variant of fisten, fizzle had a very specific meaning: to break wind without noise. Surprisingly, considering this initial definition, by the 1800s, the word fizzle referred instead to a specific sound, rather graphically, to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid being forced out of a narrow opening. The figurative sense of the word, a weak ending, is thus understandable within the context of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern or a valve drawing out the contents of the bottom of a cask. Though perhaps not derived directly from this subsiding verb, our modern meaning of fizzle developed as slang in the 1800s. Originally used on college campuses to describe failure, specifically on an exam, it wasn't long before the word came to mean exactly what it does today and was quickly and widely adopted.

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best
for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best
for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

Although the wording is not identical, the intent of the question is the same: to highlight the difference in approach to using force between the military and the police. The correct option in the ground truth MCQ (B) states that military personnel are not equipped with the same non-lethal weapons as police officers, but the underlying reason for this is the difference in their approach to using force, which is what Question 5 addresses.

However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the difference in equipment between military personnel and police officers. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would choose Question 3, as it mentions giving military personnel access to non-lethal weapons, such as those used by police officers. However, the intent of the question is different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (or 3, depending on the criteria used)

officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of

tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s.

hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 6: What is the significance of the research project's findings regarding the usage of words and phrases over time?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about specific Ngrams and their trends over time.

A closer match would be a question that asks about the trends of specific Ngrams, such as sea levels, atmospheric CO2, global temperature, and "God is not dead". Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose:

**Question 7: What is the example given in the transcript of how the research project's findings can be used to study cultural trends?**

This question is related to the analysis of Ngrams and their trends over time, but it does not specifically ask about the Ngrams mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 7 is the most similar.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **7**

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the Ngram trend implying that we are losing interest in the past. The closest generated MCQ is:

Question 6: What is the significance of the research project's findings regarding the usage of words and phrases over time? Options: A. It shows that words and phrases have remained constant over time., B. It shows that words and phrases have changed significantly over time., C. It shows that words and phrases are not important in understanding human culture., D. It shows that words and phrases are only used in certain contexts.

Although this generated MCQ does not specifically mention the Ngram trend or losing interest in the past, it does relate to the analysis of word and phrase usage over time, which is a relevant concept to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match to the ground truth MCQ, and it would be more accurate to create a new MCQ that specifically addresses the concept of Ngram trends and losing interest in the past.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level due to the significant differences between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs.

Index: 6 (with low confidence)

famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is focused on the two educators using a zombie to model neurological conditions, while the generated MCQs are focused on animation techniques.

However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if you're looking for a question that is vaguely related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, as it is the only question that mentions a method of animation that could potentially be used to create an animated zombie. However, the question intent, options, and content are still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would not recommend matching any of the generated MCQs with the ground truth MCQ. Instead, I would suggest generating new MCQs that are more closely related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: According to research, what is the primary factor that contributes to the illusion of motion in successive images? Options: A. The retention of images in the eye, B. The interpretation of images in the brain, C. The speed at which images are displayed, D. The resolution of the images**

Although the question wording is not identical, the intent and content of Question 4 align closely with the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the effect that is the basis for all motion picture technology, which is related to the illusion of motion in successive images. Question 4 asks about the primary factor contributing to this illusion, which is the interpretation of images in the brain (Option B). This is consistent with the explanation provided in the transcript.

However, an even more similar question is not present among the generated MCQs. The most similar question would be one that directly asks about the effect that is the basis for all motion picture technology, with options that include the correct answer: "When still images change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion: a persistent image that is gradually changing form and position."

Since such a question is not present, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is:

**Index: 4**

Please note that while Question 4 is the most similar, it is not an exact match, and a more similar question could be generated to align more closely with the ground truth MCQ.

Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted

I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What lesson did the speaker learn from the "Telly Actor" project? 

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. But if we consider the intent and topic of the question, Question 6 is the closest match.

But if we look at the options of Question 6, it seems that it is asking about the lesson learned from the project, not about the specific incident of the Tele-Actor giving a kiss to Sam Donaldson.

Upon re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them directly ask about the incident of the Tele-Actor giving a kiss to Sam Donaldson.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that the closest match is not available, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 6, but with a note that it's not a perfect match.

Index: 6 (with a note that it's not a perfect match)

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and

also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 3 has some similarities with the ground truth MCQ. However, the most similar generated MCQ that matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ is not present among the options.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of linking diseases with a common theme, I would choose:

 Question 2: How many deaths from heart disease are averted every year due to advances in medical research?

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ in the sense that it talks about the reduction in mortality rates due to advances in medical research, which is also the theme of the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to create a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, I would create a question that directly links AIDS, ALL, and stroke with the theme of reduced mortality rates due to early detection and early intervention.

If I had to choose an index from the existing options, I would choose:

 Question 2 (Index: 2)

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and a new MCQ should be created to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll

about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the trajectory for development at the level of the brain and how long before a patient crosses a behavioral threshold it can be detected. The correct answer is 4-7 years, but this option is not explicitly mentioned in any of the generated MCQs.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7, which asks why mental disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contribute significantly to disability. While it does not directly ask about the trajectory for development, it does mention that these disorders often start early in life, which is related to the idea of detecting brain changes before behavioral symptoms emerge.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 10, which asks about the key to making progress in understanding and treating mental disorders. The correct answer is early detection and early intervention, which is a theme that is also present in the ground truth MCQ.

But since neither of these questions is a good match, I will choose the one that talks about the brain development in the context of a disorder which is:

 Question 7

Mysteries of vernacular: Jade, a hard, typically green stone. Until relatively recently, gemstones were believed to have magical, medicinal properties, and nothing was more effective at treating a kidney disorder than jade. In the 16th century, the Spanish returned from the New World with the mineral in their cargo holds and christened it, "piedra de la ijada," or loin stone. It quickly became popular
throughout Europe, both as a cure for internal ailments and as a decorative ornament and was renamed jade by the French, a word that was borrowed by the English and remains in use to this day. In the 19th century, French mineralogists discovered that jade was being used to describe two distinct minerals: jadeite, which takes its name from jade, and the more common nephrite, the root of which is the Greek
word nephros, meaning kidney. In addition to describing
these two minerals, jade also has an English homonym. With roots that predate the popularity of the lustral gemstone, jade was used to refer to either a disreputable woman or a broken-down horse. Thus, the word jaded, meaning worn out or lacking enthusiasm, has nothing to do with the gemstone, and instead, comes from the archaic, equine-related definition.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches, has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance. But why? It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right? Wrong! Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem. I know how to calculate
the area of a circle. I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared. I also know how to take
the area of a square. I multiply the base by itself. But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area? This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle" that was first proposed
in the ancient world. And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life
during the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body, thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called "The Great Chain of Being." This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans
have a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed
at the center of the universe with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing
the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square. If geometry is the language
the universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.

**Transcript**:
This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches, has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance. But why? It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right? Wrong! Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem. I know how to calculate
the area of a circle. I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared. I also know how to take
the area of a square. I multiply the base by itself. But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area? This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle" that was first proposed
in the ancient world. And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life
during the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body, thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called "The Great Chain of Being." This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans
have a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed
at the center of the universe with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing
the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square. If geometry is the language
the universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.

Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: What is the purpose of a gene in the context of evolution? Options: A. To ensure the survival of the organism., B. To make more copies of itself., C. To create the most advantageous traits., D. To follow a predetermined plan.

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it also deals with the concept of evolution and the idea that genes have a purpose. The correct option in the generated MCQ, "To make more copies of itself," is similar to the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ, where the correct option is "An improv comedy routine," implying that evolution is a process that proceeds without a predetermined plan, with genes making more copies of themselves as a result of random genetic mutations.

However, an even more suitable match can be found in Question 7: Is there an outside mechanism that selects which genes are best to preserve in the process of evolution? Options: A. Yes, natural selection., B. No, it's just a metaphor., C. It's a combination of natural selection and genetic drift., D. It's determined by the environment.

This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ because it directly addresses the idea that the concept of natural selection is a metaphor, which is also implied in the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in the generated MCQ, "No, it's just a metaphor," aligns with the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ, where the correct option is "An improv comedy routine," implying that evolution is a process that proceeds without a predetermined plan or outside mechanism.

But the most suitable match is Question 8: Does evolution proceed with a predetermined plan or ideal form in mind? Options: A. Yes, it's directed towards creating the most advantageous traits., B. No, it proceeds blindly, step by step., C. It's a combination of both., D. It's determined by the environment.

This question is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ because it directly addresses the idea that evolution proceeds without a predetermined plan or ideal form, which is also implied in the ground truth MCQ. The correct option in the generated MCQ, "No, it proceeds blindly, step by step," aligns with the idea presented in the ground truth MCQ, where the correct option is "An improv comedy routine," implying that evolution is a process that proceeds without a predetermined plan.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ uses a metaphor to describe evolution, whereas the generated MCQs are more direct and factual.

published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9: Why do humans crave calories rather than nutrients and vitamins?

This question is related to the concept of non-ideal traits existing in organisms, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer to Question 9, "Because calories were scarce during our ancestors' evolution," implies that the trait of craving calories rather than nutrients and vitamins is a non-ideal trait that has evolved due to environmental pressures.

Although the options in Question 9 do not directly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. Therefore, I would identify Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: What is the purpose of a gene in the context of evolution? Options: A. To ensure the survival of the organism., B. To make more copies of itself., C. To create the most advantageous traits., D. To follow a predetermined plan.**

However, the correct answer is not explicitly provided among the options of Question 6. A more suitable match can be found in:

**Question 5: Can a gene that makes an animal altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins become more widespread? Options: A. No, because the organism dies without reproducing., B. Yes, because the gene can still be passed on to relatives., C. Only if the organism has already reproduced., D. It depends on the specific circumstances.**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and the options provided align with the concept presented in the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer (B) in Question 5 implies that genes get passed on due to their effect on organism traits and behaviors, which affects their reproductive success.

However, an even more suitable match can be found in:

**Question 7: Is there an outside mechanism that selects which genes are best to preserve in the process of evolution? Options: A. Yes, natural selection., B. No, it's just a metaphor., C. It's a combination of natural selection and genetic drift., D. It's determined by the environment.**

Here, option B implies that there is no outside mechanism, and option A is incorrect because natural selection is not an outside mechanism that actively selects genes. Instead, it is the result of random genetic mutations that cause changes in organism traits and behaviors.

Considering all the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly provided. However, if I had to choose the most similar one based on question intent, options, and content, I would choose:

**Question 7**

However, I must note that Question 7 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly asks why some genes get passed on but not others, with options that align with the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a more suitable match based on the content and intent of the questions.

**Question 4: What is the primary mechanism by which evolution occurs? Options: A. Survival of the fittest, B. Natural selection, C. Reproduction, D. Genetic drift**

This question does not explicitly ask why some genes get passed on, but it does relate to the mechanism of evolution. The correct answer, "Reproduction," implies that genes get passed on through reproduction, which is affected by random genetic mutations that cause changes in organism traits and behaviors.

Considering the limitations of the generated MCQs, I would choose:

**Question 4**

However, I must emphasize that Question 4 is not a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

After re-evaluating the generated MCQs, I realized that I missed a crucial aspect of the ground truth MCQ. The correct answer, "Mutations in some genes affect organism traits and behaviors in ways that affect their reproductive success," is not explicitly provided among the options of the generated MCQs.

However, I can suggest an alternative approach to find the most similar generated MCQ. I can look for a question that addresses the concept of genetic mutations and their effect on organism traits and behaviors.

**Question 1: What is the primary reason why individual organisms do not evolve? Options: A. They are not capable of adapting to their environment., B. Random genetic mutations cause changes in populations, not individuals., C. Evolution only occurs through natural selection., D. Organisms are not able to pass on traits to their offspring.**

This question addresses the concept of genetic mutations and their effect on populations. Although it does not explicitly ask why some genes get passed on, it does relate to the idea that genetic mutations cause changes in organism traits and behaviors.

Considering the limitations of the generated MCQs, I would choose:

**Question 1**

However, I must emphasize that Question 1 is not a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

In conclusion, while none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I believe that:

**Question 1**

is the most similar generated MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of its relevance to the concept of gravity and falling objects.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the force of gravity acting on a ball tossed up in the air. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, I found that Question 4: "What happens to an astronaut in a satellite as they move around the Earth?" is the most relevant to the concept of gravity and falling objects.

However, an even more relevant question is Question 3: "Why does an astronaut in a satellite not fall straight down to the Earth?" This question is related to the concept of gravity and falling objects, and it addresses the idea that objects in orbit are constantly falling towards the Earth but missing it due to their sideways motion.

But the most similar question in terms of the concept of gravity is Question 10: "What is the term for the state of continuously falling towards the Earth but missing it?" This question addresses the concept of free fall and orbit, which is closely related to the concept of gravity.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 10

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Quarantine, a state, period, or place
of strict isolation meant to prevent the spread of disease. In the 14th century, the Bubonic Plague, later called "The Black Death," spread across Europe with devastating consequences. It's been estimated that the Plague decimated
at least one-third of Europe's population. In a vain effort to stave off infection, the Italian-speaking port city of Ragusa, in what is now Croatia, mandated that ships arriving from Plague-infested areas remain isolated on the water until it was deemed likely that they weren't carrying a disease. This meant that the entire
contents of a ship and all of its passengers were often forced to remain on board for five or six weeks
before being let ashore. Though the drastic measure was only marginally successful, it wasn't long before other
port cities followed suit. In 1397, the official period of isolation imposed on ships and crews was set at forty days. Although it did little to protect
ports from infection, the directive stuck. From the Italian word quaranta, meaning forty, this period of stasis was given the name quarantine. And by the mid 1600s, the word quarantine was being used to describe any place, period, or state of isolation, plague-related or not.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Dear Nickelodeon, I've gotten
over how SpongeBob's pants are not actually square. I can ignore most of the
time that Gary's shell is not a logarithmic spiral. But what I cannot forgive is
that SpongeBob's pineapple house is a mathematical
impossibility. There's three easy ways to
find spirals on a pineapple. There's the ones that
wind up it going right, the ones that spiral
up to the left, and the ones that go almost
straight up-- keyword almost. If you count the number
of spirals going left and the number of
spirals going right, they'll be adjacent
Fibonacci numbers-- 3 and 5, or 5 and 8, 8 and
13, or 13 and 21. You claim that
SpongeBob Squarepants lives in a pineapple under
the sea, but does he really? A true pineapple would
have Fibonacci spiral, so let's take a look. Because these
images of his house don't let us pick it
up and turn it around to count the number of
spirals going around it, it might be hard to figure out
whether it's mathematically a pineapple or not. But there's a huge clue in the
third spiral, the one going upwards. In this pineapple there's 8
to the right, 13 to the left. You can add those
numbers together to get how many spirals
are in the set spiraling steeply upwards. In this case, 21. The three sets of
spirals in any pineapple are pretty much always
adjacent Fibonacci numbers. The rare mutant cases might
show Lucas numbers or something, but it will always be three
adjacent numbers in a series. What you'll never have
is the same number of spirals both ways. Pineapples, unlike people,
don't have bilateral symmetry. You'll never have
that third spiral be not a spiral, but just
a straight line going up a pineapple. Yet, when we look at
SpongeBob's supposed pineapple under the sea, it
clearly has lines of pineapple things
going straight up. It clearly has
bilateral symmetry. It clearly is not actually
a pineapple at all, because no pineapple could
possibly grow that way. Nickelodeon, you need to take
a long, hard look in the mirror and think about the way
you're misrepresenting the universe to your viewers. This kind of
mathematical oversight is simply irresponsible. Sincerely, Vi Hart.

Beatbox is the original instrument. It all comes from the voice. Today, we're going teach you
the three basic sounds of beatbox, which make up the foundation of it. Now, the "kick"
is the kick drum on the bottom and it makes the loud bass sound. It sounds like this: (Beatboxes bass sound) Alright? You hear that? (Beatboxes bass sound) How do you make that sound? Well, the way you make that sound
is you take a "p" and you take a "b" and you mesh those two together and it's going to give you
what we refer to as the kick drum. Pb! Pb! Pb! So, alright, so you try this: Pb! Pb! Excellent! Now, the next sound
is the almighty snare sound. And the snare sound
is basically taking a "k" and an "a" and putting those two sounds together. And it sounds like this: Ka! Ka! Ka! Alright? So just try that, really easy. Ka! Ka! Ka! Now, the last sound
is one of my favorite sounds. It's the hi-hat. The hi-hat's my favorite sound, because it's always
on the tip of your tongue. You basically take a "t" and an "s" and twist those two together, and it's going to sound like this: Ts Ts, Ts, Ts. It's great, right? So, you put all those together and you can make some really
amazing, wonderful music that you can do anywhere. We can make beats in the car, right? So we can just drive
through the city, making a beat. And it sounds a little
something like this. Let's speak to them. (Beatboxing) (Beatboxing ends) Alright, so that's how you can
actually speak to each other. Now, those are really complex
beat patterns, right? So, we'll do a few beat patterns with you and you repeat after me so you can begin
to learn these sounds, alright? So check this out: (Beatboxing) [Pb Ts Ka] [Pa Ka] (Beatboxing) [Ts Ka Ts Ka Pb] (Beatboxing) [Pb Ka Ka Pb Ts] (Beatboxing) [Ts Ts Ka Pb] So we can take all of those
different rhythms and sounds, and jam with each other
by listening to each other, right? So right now we're just rolling around,
we're going to drop a phat beat, maybe see if we can find some friends. Check this out! (Beatboxing) [Beatsynth's mom] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts]

Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

**Transcript**:
Hmmm, that's not what we want, is it? Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture.

Cole a new course new girlfriend maybe very exciting how do we calm it down hmm you give it a patch behind the ears and and everything is all right again so so that's very intuitive and that's what we want so what we have seen at three ways to make the digital grass cover for us and I think making it physical is a good way to do that what's behind that is a postulation namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future rather than that technology a bit more human [Applause] [Music]

**Transcript**:
I am a PhD student and that means I have a question how can we make digital content grasp the ball because you see on the one hand there is the digital world and no question many things are happening there right now and for us humans it's not quite a material that's already there it's virtual on the other hand we humans we live in a physical world it's rich it tastes good it feels good it smells good so the question is how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical that's my question if you look at the iPhone with its touch and there we with its body the activity you can see the tendency it's getting physical the question is what's next now I have three options that I would like to show you the first one is mass as humans we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy so could we use that in mobile phones let me show you the weight shifting mobile it is a mobile phone shaped box that has an iron weight inside which we can move around and you can feel where it's heavy we shift the gravitational center of it for example we can augment digital content with physical mass so you move around the content on the display but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device another thing it's good for is navigation it can guide you around in a city it can tell you by its weight okay move right walk ahead make a left here and the good thing about that is you don't have to look at the device all the time you have your eyes free to see the city now mass is the first thing the second thing that's shape we're also sensitive to the shape of objects we have enhance so if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages well that could be thin right but it has 500 pages I want to feel that Harry Potter it's thick so let me show you the shape changing mobile again it's a mobile phone shaped box and this one can change its shape we can play with the shape itself for example it can be thin in your pocket which we of course want it to be but then if you hold in your hand it can lean towards you be thick it's like tapered to the downside to change the grasp we can adjust to that it's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use this alarm clock it stands it's fairly simple another thing is sometimes we watch things on the mobile phone they are bigger than the phone itself so in that case like here this map it's bigger than the phone screen the shape of the phone could tell you ok off the screen right here there was more content you can't see it but it's there and you can feel that because it's thicker at that edge shape is the second thing the third thing operates on a different level as humans we are we are social we are empathic and that's great wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive think of a hamster in the pocket I can feel it's doing all right I don't have to check it let me let me show you the living more bat phone ok so once again mobile phone shaped box but this one it has a breath and a heartbeat it feels very organic and you can tell it's relaxed right now oh now mr. Cole a new course new girlfriend maybe very exciting how do we calm it down hmm you give it a patch behind the ears and and everything is all right again so so that's very intuitive and that's what we want so what we have seen at three ways to make the digital grass cover for us and I think making it physical is a good way to do that what's behind that is a postulation namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future rather than that technology a bit more human [Applause] [Music]

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Sarcophagus, a stone coffin typically adorned with decorative carvings or inscriptions. The history of the word sarcophagus is so skin-crawlingly grotesque, it seems to come right out of a low-budget horror film. Rather than having
a B-movie origin, however, its roots can be traced back
to the early Roman Empire where the Greek word sarkophagus was used to describe the limestone that a coffin was made of, not the coffin itself. According to the Roman
scholar Pliny the Elder, citizens of the Empire believed that limestone from a quarry near Troy would dissolve flesh. For this reason, it was quite desireable in the construction of coffins. Though it's unclear
if the belief was widespread or even accurately reported by Pliny, what is certain is that sarkophagus came from the Greek words sark, meaning flesh, and phagein, a verb meaning to eat. From flesh-eating stone to stone coffin, it's a fitting etymology for the final resting
place of the deceased.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What does the Greek word sark mean?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

**Transcript**:
Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you
are completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual
or auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling
like you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. "The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged
for a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly." Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state
of sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might
think that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises
you while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,
the dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually
happening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe
that sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing
a number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious
and fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you
from running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing
normal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles
are paralyzed, only your brain is conscious
and wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small
blockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you
to take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air
while your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience
an episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, "tip of the iceberg." Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.

Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build
layer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve
off to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live
for three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts
of strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when
the water-ice interface reaches compressed air
bubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size
classifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit
just at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get
that blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very
little air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount
of air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far
northern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice
are barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical
mile away from the iceberg. This water is colder
than the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation
creates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small
ice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins
seem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be
the one to see a little deeper.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever heard the term, "tip of the iceberg"? You know that icebergs
are mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden
beneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9
of the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, "tip of the iceberg." Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean.

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history that the Moon is at just
the right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used. The eclipse might put the Sun to shame, but even a shamed Sun can seriously damage your eyes.

**Transcript**:
On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast
to the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery
ring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse
of the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian
pharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers
paid with their lives if they failed to predict
the solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific
event in human history, a battle between the armies
of Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms
and declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves
between the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover
the disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much
larger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass
between the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance
to block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows
will see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block
out the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite
line up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun
are perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far
from Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions
of a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth
that is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be
remarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly
moving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours
had bothered to look up during a solar eclipse
a hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen
the fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have
moved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink
of Earth's history that the Moon is at just
the right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly
lines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be
in its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses
are one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used. The eclipse might put the Sun to shame, but even a shamed Sun can seriously damage your eyes.

**Transcript**:
In this short video, we're going to show you how we use two different animation techniques, both rotoscoping and traditional hand-drawn animation in the TED-Ed Lesson, "Miss Gayle's 5 Steps to Slam Poetry: A Lesson of Transformation." A poetry slam is a competition in which poets are judged on their poems, often for qualities of emotional power and lyrical resonance. Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves
through spoken words, a Lesson, which offers
a guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great
example of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th
grade writing class, struggling with the assignment
of having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated
by rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing
of live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right
into pre-production. In animation, pre-production
is the planning stage. It's all the decisions
that need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors
and camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine
how much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot
of time down the road. For our project, a storyboard
was first created, in which the framing,
composition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie
of the storyboard. This helped us figure
out the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything
would flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots,
we first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had
in our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines
two or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing
and motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary
negative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots
were then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective
at the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion
of the animation was all planned out by the animator
ahead of time. An appropriate number
of drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then
plotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. "Mama's lies are footsteps
too many to count making excuses on black snow." Animation's a medium that's also
uniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect
of experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques
for the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey
in a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Transcriber: Andrea McDonough
Reviewer: Jessica Ruby Mysteries of vernacular: Fizzle, to end weakly or to fail, to die out. The definition of fizzle likely links back to the Old English word fist, which meant stink. In the mid-fifteenth century, fist developed into the verb fisten, to break wind, which eventually lead to the modern word feisty, but that's another story. In its earliest form, as a variant of fisten, fizzle had a very specific meaning: to break wind without noise. Surprisingly, considering this initial definition, by the 1800s, the word fizzle referred instead to a specific sound, rather graphically, to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid being forced out of a narrow opening. The figurative sense of the word, a weak ending, is thus understandable within the context of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern or a valve drawing out the contents of the bottom of a cask. Though perhaps not derived directly from this subsiding verb, our modern meaning of fizzle developed as slang in the 1800s. Originally used on college campuses to describe failure, specifically on an exam, it wasn't long before the word came to mean exactly what it does today and was quickly and widely adopted.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What was the original meaning of the word fist?
Options: A. a tiny ball, B. a tightly wound coil, C. to stink, D. a barb or thorn

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

**Transcript**:
We live in a three-dimensional world where everything has length, width, and height. But what if our world
were two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world
look and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical
thought experiment that follows the trials
and tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,
a dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles
to all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional
space is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new
perpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square
protagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying
around a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye
on the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially
one dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks
different from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend
the third dimension. In fact, they vehemently
deny its existence because it's simply not
part of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no
Flatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square
can see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles
at the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation
is understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience
of the world. Short of being lifted
into the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D
cross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension
with a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes
through the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional
line segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square
and extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular
to all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception. Doesn't that blow
your little spherical mind?

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best
for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.

the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool
to room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat
the seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing
protective goggles and gloves any time you work with such
a dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch
in the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach
so they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best
for different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification
techniques work best will be useful if you ever
need to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden.

**Transcript**:
So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life
on Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types
of essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird
things to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn
down by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances
of successful germination. One technique we can
use is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage
the plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't
want to file too much, just enough to wear
down some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this

Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the

fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this

course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] [Applause] everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of

You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set
of scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving
a character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach
is pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing
your key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need
to create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose
couldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well
before the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place
and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

You might remember
a pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim
certainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation
is a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation
of a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving
each element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses
are generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional
in a flat environment. For example, you might not
want to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the "Sound of Music" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching
and designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety
of extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate
amount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy
is an integral part of designing any 2-D
or 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number
of dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms
is known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has
its own anchor point, which essentially assigns
the limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point
for the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts.

and move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What effect is the basis for all motion picture technology?
Options: A. When still images change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion: a persistent image that is gradually changing form and position, B. Lights have to feed the sensors in a camera that will capture any action that takes place (hence, "Lights, camera, action!"), C. Storyboards must be constructed before the first motion picture is captured; this ensures that each still is properly accounted for so that the end product is ordered and logical, D.

the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate
of around ten frames per second. As the frame rate increases, we lose awareness
of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Transcript**:
Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking
at a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion
of appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing
form and position. This effect is the basis
for all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century
cathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection
to the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,
all the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving
apparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic
of human perception historically referred
to as "persistence of vision." The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist
Peter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe
a particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still
when it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term
was applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,
inventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision
as the result of successive afterimages, which were retained
and then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing
is a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted
in the decades to follow and up through the turn
of the 20th century, when some began to question
what was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist
Max Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages
of apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes
which lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer
in applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion
of successive images is not due to their being
retained in the eye, but is superadded
by the action of the mind. In the century to follow,
experiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed
their conclusions. As it relates to the illusion
of motion pictures, persistence of vision
has less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects
of what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas
of the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations
in the visual cortex that stitch those different
aspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,
hear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment
flow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion
of motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains
process the present. So, how fast is the present
happening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast
the images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out
by repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented
at a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space
separating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position
becomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling
of a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting
to get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact
that we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,
the motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose
awareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around
eight to 12 frames per second. This is in the neighborhood
of what science has determined to be the general threshold
of our awareness of seeing separate images. Generally speaking,
we being to lose that awareness at intervals of around
100 milliseconds per image, which is equal to a frame rate

of the intervals completely and are all the more convinced
of the reality of the illusion.

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year

and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you

**Transcript**:
I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs -

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Jade, a hard, typically green stone. Until relatively recently, gemstones were believed to have magical, medicinal properties, and nothing was more effective at treating a kidney disorder than jade. In the 16th century, the Spanish returned from the New World with the mineral in their cargo holds and christened it, "piedra de la ijada," or loin stone. It quickly became popular
throughout Europe, both as a cure for internal ailments and as a decorative ornament and was renamed jade by the French, a word that was borrowed by the English and remains in use to this day. In the 19th century, French mineralogists discovered that jade was being used to describe two distinct minerals: jadeite, which takes its name from jade, and the more common nephrite, the root of which is the Greek
word nephros, meaning kidney. In addition to describing
these two minerals, jade also has an English homonym. With roots that predate the popularity of the lustral gemstone, jade was used to refer to either a disreputable woman or a broken-down horse. Thus, the word jaded, meaning worn out or lacking enthusiasm, has nothing to do with the gemstone, and instead, comes from the archaic, equine-related definition.

**Transcript**:
This image of the Vitruvian Man,
taken from Leonardo's sketches, has become one of the most recognizable
symbols of the Renaissance. But why? It's a simple pen and ink drawing, right? Wrong! Let's start to answer this question
with a math problem. I know how to calculate
the area of a circle. I take the value for pi
and multiply it by the radius squared. I also know how to take
the area of a square. I multiply the base by itself. But how can I take the area of a circle
and create a square with an equal area? This is a problem
often called "squaring a circle" that was first proposed
in the ancient world. And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life
during the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem
is impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings
of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center
of a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel
is the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass
and places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn
perfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized
that arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence
in the human body, thus placing the body
perfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem
of squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking
about Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement
in Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept
from the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called "The Great Chain of Being." This belief holds that the universe
has a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,
planets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place
in this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body
accompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo
sketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola
had a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans
have a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired
a being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated
universe he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed
at the center of the universe with the ability
to take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain
and behave like an animal or crawl up the chain
and behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing
the position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas
of a circle and a square. If geometry is the language
the universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say
we can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape
he pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,
Leonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,
philosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon
for the entire time period.

Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

**Transcript**:
Myths and misconceptions about evolution. Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider
it controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty
good understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe
some things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, "Evolution is organisms
adapting to their environment." This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin
published his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those
on to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves
on higher branches, their children would be
born with longer necks. But we know now that's not
how genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms
don't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be
born with longer necks, and that gives them
a better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to "survival of the fittest". This makes it sound
like evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary
fitness is just a matter of how well-suited
they are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not
how evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited
for survival at birth that it has to quickly find
a mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies
without reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene
that exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal
altruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival
and future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned
with self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things
to keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, "Genes want to make more
copies of themselves," or even, "natural selection," we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes
are best to preserve. All that happens is that random
genetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human
eye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity
we see in the natural world.

In this short video, we're going to show you
how we used animation to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

In this short video, we're going to show you
how we used animation to make custom playing
cards to do magical tricks in TED-Ed's Lesson on synesthesia. Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more
senses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise
physically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain
the nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very
difficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital
motion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively
work out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need
to shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize
each nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement
was consistent. But sometimes four hands
just isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh
into different sized pyramids, the cards can be held
in different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot
individual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key
out the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned
your ingredients carefully, everything should come
together just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find. We'd love to see you make some of your own animated illusions.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: An orbiting astronaut would feel like they were ____.
Options: A. Floating in a swimming pool, B. On a roller coaster about to take a huge dive, C. Hanging from a rope, D. Lying down on a waterbed
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What would it feel like to be an astronaut in outer space?

**Transcript**:
Have you ever been floating
in a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, "Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,
look down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,
you are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:
that's the feeling you get if you're going over the top
of a roller coaster, going, like, "Whoa!" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,
a little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot
it really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you
in the backside or something. Let's zoom way back
and put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down
and hit the Earth. But you are actually moving
sideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side
of the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling
you back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in
and you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,
and now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,
but you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side
of the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up
and so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth
again, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing
because you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,
they're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,
so you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran
fast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going
eight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth
and come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up
due to atmospheric friction. So, I do not recommend this.

**Transcript**:
Mysteries of vernacular: Quarantine, a state, period, or place
of strict isolation meant to prevent the spread of disease. In the 14th century, the Bubonic Plague, later called "The Black Death," spread across Europe with devastating consequences. It's been estimated that the Plague decimated
at least one-third of Europe's population. In a vain effort to stave off infection, the Italian-speaking port city of Ragusa, in what is now Croatia, mandated that ships arriving from Plague-infested areas remain isolated on the water until it was deemed likely that they weren't carrying a disease. This meant that the entire
contents of a ship and all of its passengers were often forced to remain on board for five or six weeks
before being let ashore. Though the drastic measure was only marginally successful, it wasn't long before other
port cities followed suit. In 1397, the official period of isolation imposed on ships and crews was set at forty days. Although it did little to protect
ports from infection, the directive stuck. From the Italian word quaranta, meaning forty, this period of stasis was given the name quarantine. And by the mid 1600s, the word quarantine was being used to describe any place, period, or state of isolation, plague-related or not.

**Transcript**:
Dear Nickelodeon, I've gotten
over how SpongeBob's pants are not actually square. I can ignore most of the
time that Gary's shell is not a logarithmic spiral. But what I cannot forgive is
that SpongeBob's pineapple house is a mathematical
impossibility. There's three easy ways to
find spirals on a pineapple. There's the ones that
wind up it going right, the ones that spiral
up to the left, and the ones that go almost
straight up-- keyword almost. If you count the number
of spirals going left and the number of
spirals going right, they'll be adjacent
Fibonacci numbers-- 3 and 5, or 5 and 8, 8 and
13, or 13 and 21. You claim that
SpongeBob Squarepants lives in a pineapple under
the sea, but does he really? A true pineapple would
have Fibonacci spiral, so let's take a look. Because these
images of his house don't let us pick it
up and turn it around to count the number of
spirals going around it, it might be hard to figure out
whether it's mathematically a pineapple or not. But there's a huge clue in the
third spiral, the one going upwards. In this pineapple there's 8
to the right, 13 to the left. You can add those
numbers together to get how many spirals
are in the set spiraling steeply upwards. In this case, 21. The three sets of
spirals in any pineapple are pretty much always
adjacent Fibonacci numbers. The rare mutant cases might
show Lucas numbers or something, but it will always be three
adjacent numbers in a series. What you'll never have
is the same number of spirals both ways. Pineapples, unlike people,
don't have bilateral symmetry. You'll never have
that third spiral be not a spiral, but just
a straight line going up a pineapple. Yet, when we look at
SpongeBob's supposed pineapple under the sea, it
clearly has lines of pineapple things
going straight up. It clearly has
bilateral symmetry. It clearly is not actually
a pineapple at all, because no pineapple could
possibly grow that way. Nickelodeon, you need to take
a long, hard look in the mirror and think about the way
you're misrepresenting the universe to your viewers. This kind of
mathematical oversight is simply irresponsible. Sincerely, Vi Hart.

Beatbox is the original instrument. It all comes from the voice. Today, we're going teach you
the three basic sounds of beatbox, which make up the foundation of it. Now, the "kick"
is the kick drum on the bottom and it makes the loud bass sound. It sounds like this: (Beatboxes bass sound) Alright? You hear that? (Beatboxes bass sound) How do you make that sound? Well, the way you make that sound
is you take a "p" and you take a "b" and you mesh those two together and it's going to give you
what we refer to as the kick drum. Pb! Pb! Pb! So, alright, so you try this: Pb! Pb! Excellent! Now, the next sound
is the almighty snare sound. And the snare sound
is basically taking a "k" and an "a" and putting those two sounds together. And it sounds like this: Ka! Ka! Ka! Alright? So just try that, really easy. Ka! Ka! Ka! Now, the last sound
is one of my favorite sounds. It's the hi-hat. The hi-hat's my favorite sound, because it's always
on the tip of your tongue. You basically take a "t" and an "s" and twist those two together, and it's going to sound like this: Ts Ts, Ts, Ts. It's great, right? So, you put all those together and you can make some really
amazing, wonderful music that you can do anywhere. We can make beats in the car, right? So we can just drive
through the city, making a beat. And it sounds a little
something like this. Let's speak to them. (Beatboxing) (Beatboxing ends) Alright, so that's how you can
actually speak to each other. Now, those are really complex
beat patterns, right? So, we'll do a few beat patterns with you and you repeat after me so you can begin
to learn these sounds, alright? So check this out: (Beatboxing) [Pb Ts Ka] [Pa Ka] (Beatboxing) [Ts Ka Ts Ka Pb] (Beatboxing) [Pb Ka Ka Pb Ts] (Beatboxing) [Ts Ts Ka Pb] So we can take all of those
different rhythms and sounds, and jam with each other
by listening to each other, right? So right now we're just rolling around,
we're going to drop a phat beat, maybe see if we can find some friends. Check this out! (Beatboxing) [Beatsynth's mom] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts] [Pb Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts Ts]
