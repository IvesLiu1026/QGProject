**Transcript**:
My wife grew up in Santa Rosa, California, and her best friend
was a woman named Joy Durand who lived on the northeast
outskirts of town. At midnight on the evening
of October 8, 2017, Joy's telephone rang. The voice said simply, "You must evacuate now. You don't have time to pack. Fire is coming." Joy gathered her parents
and her six-year-old son, and they hurried outside. The wildfire, which at that point
was just over the ridge from Joy's house, sounded like a jet engine
going at full throttle. The family got in their car, drove away, and within minutes,
their home had burned to the ground, incinerated by the blowtorch flames
of the Tubbs Fire. All night long, my wife got texts
and messages from friends and family, and while we didn’t know
the whole situation, it was clear that a disaster
was unfolding in her hometown. No one thought that fire could penetrate
so deeply into the city. But on that evening, 22 people lost their lives and over five thousand homes
and structures were destroyed. Wildfire is a large and growing challenge
to the West and to the world. What happened in Santa Rosa
is becoming all too common. Paradise in 2018, Australia in 2020,
Europe in 2022. And fire experts say that we should get ready
for more Santa Rosas because it's likely to get worse
before it gets better. Now beyond the major costs in lives and property and the economy, there's also a big
carbon impact to wildfire. In fact, the additional carbon
from California's 2020 wildfires was greater than the carbon that Californians had worked
so hard to save over the previous two decades. The largest fires are called megafires. These are the ones
that burn over 100,000 acres with the intensity that can threaten
aquifers and biodiversity, and even cause forest conversion, in which trees are so damaged
that they just don't grow back. These fires are getting worse as well. In fact, eight of the ten
largest megafires in California history have happened
over just the last five years. Many people feel overwhelmed
by this situation. I know I did. So two years ago,
working with great people, I closed a chapter
of my life in aerospace and I started a new journey to see if I could understand
the wildfire crisis better and what could be done about it. I started working with leaders
from firefighting and philanthropy, entrepreneurship,
science, tribal communities, and together we cofounded an organization
called Megafire Action, whose sole purpose
is to solve the megafire crisis. And I've come to believe
that if we take a holistic approach, we have an opportunity
to establish a new relationship with fire, to work safely with fire and potentially to solve
this wicked problem. The path forward has three solutions. The first is fire-adapted communities, the second is resilient landscapes and the third is
innovative fire management. So for the first,
fire-adapted communities, what we need to do is to clear the brush
and the vegetation from homes, from the immediate proximity of homes. Next, we need to
use fire-resistant materials in the homes and the roofs. And then the third thing
is to, where possible, protect against embers, flying embers, by protecting the home from openings
like your air vents and your chimneys. Now communities have
a strong shared interest to perform this work along
the exterior boundary of the community because it reduces the chance that fire will penetrate
deeply into the city, as it did in Santa Rosa. The second solution
is resilient landscapes. And if you take one lesson
from this talk, it's this. In order to solve the megafire crisis, we need to bring our western landscapes
back into a healthy balance by reducing the overgrown brush and trees
in the wildlands and the forest. Here we're finally starting
to take to heart the wisdom of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas who knew that fire was
a natural part of the landscape and who introduced low-intensity fire,
good fire, on a regular basis, at the right times. When this is done well, as around the communities
of South Lake Tahoe, then it can actually divert a megafire as bad as the one
that they experienced in 2021. It can also potentially prevent
a megafire from occurring, which is what some people think
happened in Napa of last year. But the scale of this challenge is huge. There are hundreds of millions of acres
of wildland in the American forests. The Forest Service
hopes to reduce the risk on 50 million high-priority acres
over the next ten years. But the challenge is that they're only
accomplishing a few million acres a year. And so we're not at the pace or scale that we need to do
to address this challenge. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing that we need to do is to essentially hire,
train and retain many more workers who will be doing the hard work
of defusing the time bombs inside our western forests. We need to pay them well. We need to support them
with full-time work and we need to protect them
from liability where necessary. The next thing we need to do
is to empower them with innovation. And right now there are
an incredible number of great companies and organizations that are working
to bring this innovation to reality. Just one of these companies
is called BurnBot, and what they're hoping to do is to make controlled burns
safer and faster. They're going to establish
a burned perimeter around an area with the remotely piloted rover and then they can bring a drone
into the middle of it, drop some fire into it
and burn that interior area safely. It's a brilliant but a simple idea. And I think we're going to need
a lot more of this kind of innovation if we're going to scale up
to the to the size of the problem that we have before us. Now the first two solutions
that I've talked to you about are pretty well agreed. The third one, innovative fire management,
is somewhat more controversial, but I think it offers huge potential
to address and solve the wildfire problem. What we need is innovation and technology
that can rapidly detect and assess fire and then quickly put it out
when it gets bad. And here, speed is paramount, because when you're
in the worst kind of fire days -- these are the hottest,
driest and windiest fire days -- if you can't bring fire management
resources to a fire very quickly, then it is likely that you
won't be able to contain that fire. Here we need to look at the example of the Quick Reaction Force
of Southern California, which is really designed
in some ways for these toughest days. The QRF is a public-private partnership, which now has three Chinook helicopters. These are the big ones
with the two rotors on the top. And each of them can drop
up to 3000 gallons of water on a fire, day or night, and they can do it very precisely. They can also refill
up to six times an hour so they can bring
a lot of mass to the problem. Over the course of two years
of demonstrations, the QRF has demonstrated
that this model has great potential, that, in fact, if you can bring
a lot of fire management resource to a fire very quickly, you can get on top of fires
before they get big and unmanageable. And this opens up
an exciting potential future. Imagine this model
with a series of larger drone vehicles distributed across the landscape
in higher-fire-risk areas. Imagine these vehicles
positioned periodically along utility lines or in areas of higher fire-risk
deep in the forest. Such a distributed network,
if connected to the right sensor system, could offer a future in which we are able
to really put out fires on the worst fire days,
and even in remote communities. Companies like Rain and Joby Aviation
are working on this vision today. The sensor system
will also be very important for the resolution of this problem. The system -- which will entail both ground-based,
aerial and space-based platforms -- won't be important just because
we're going to be able to see and detect fire where and when it pops up, but also because it'll enable us to differentiate
between good and bad fire, low-intensity fire
and high-intensity fire, which is very important because we need
more lower-intensity fire on the landscape to rejuvenate our forests, just as much as we need to know where and when fire risk
is becoming higher intensity. Fire is a prism through which
we can see the future of humanity's relationship
with natural systems. Working together
and supported by technology, we can build a world in which communities
are resilient to wildfire and in which forests
are brought back into a healthy balance. Ultimately, we can build a future, in which we don't just manage fire
to protect human life and property, but also to protect the biosphere
for global carbon emissions and for biodiversity. Ultimately, we need to become
the crew of Spaceship Earth. So let's get to work. Let's learn from fire and let's build a resilient,
sustainable future. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In the late 1700s, a German doctor named
Samuel Hahnemann began publishing articles about a new treatment
approach he called homeopathy. Hahnemann’s theory had
two central hypotheses. First, the treatment for an ailment
should be a dose of something that might cause that ailment. And second, diluted medicines are more
powerful than concentrated ones. So, a homeopathic remedy for insomnia might include an extremely diluted
solution of caffeine. Over the following 300 years, numerous physicians and patients
turned to homeopathy, and entire hospitals were built
to focus on homeopathic treatments. But despite all this, many studies have
shown that homeopathy has no therapeutic effect, and homeopathic treatments often
perform no better than placebos. So why do so many practitioners
and institutions still support this practice? The answer is that homeopathy
is a pseudoscience— a collection of theories, methods,
and assumptions that appear scientific,
but aren’t. In the worst cases, pseudoscience
practitioners encourage this confusion to exploit people. But even when they’re well-intentioned, pseudoscience still prevents people
from getting the help they need. So how are you supposed to tell what’s
science and what’s pseudoscience? This question is known as
the demarcation problem, and there's no easy answer. Part of the issue is that defining
science is surprisingly tricky. There's a common idea that all science
should, in some form or another, be related to testing
against empirical evidence. But some scientific activities
are primarily theoretical, and different disciplines
approach empiricism with varying goals, methodologies,
and standards. 20th century philosopher Karl Popper
tried to solve the demarcation problem with a simple rule. He argued that in order
for a theory to be scientific it must be falsifiable,
or able to be proven wrong. This requires a theory to make
specific predictions— for example, if you’re theorizing
that the Earth revolves around the Sun, you should be able to predict the path of
other celestial bodies in the night sky. This could then be disproven
based on whether or not your prediction corresponds
to your observations. Popper’s falsification criterion 
is a great way to identify pseudoscientific fields
like astrology, which makes overly broad predictions
that adapt to any observation. However, falsification alone doesn't
completely solve the demarcation issue. Many things we now consider science
were once untestable due to a lack of knowledge or technology. Fortunately, there are other factors
we can use to identify pseudoscience, including how a field responds
to criticism. Scientists should always be open
to the possibility that new observations could change
what they previously thought, and thoroughly disproven theories should
be rejected in favor of new explanations. Conversely, pseudoscientific theories are
often continually modified to explain away any contradictory results. This kind of behavior shows a resistance to what philosopher Helen Longino
calls transformative criticism. Pseudoscientific fields don't seek
to address their internal biases or meaningfully engage
in transparent peer review. Another key marker of science
is overall consistency. Science relies on a network
of shared information that ongoing research 
develops across disciplines. But pseudoscience often ignores
or denies this shared pool of data. For example, creationists claim
that animals didn’t evolve from a common ancestor, and that Earth is
less than 20,000 years old. But these claims contradict
huge amounts of evidence across multiple scientific disciplines, including geology, paleontology,
and biology. While the scientific method
is our most reliable tool to analyze empirical evidence
from the world around us, it certainly doesn't reveal everything
about the human condition. Faith-based beliefs can play an important
role in our lives and cultural traditions. But the reason it’s so important
to draw a line is that people often dress up
belief systems as science in efforts to manipulate others or undermine legitimate
scientific discoveries. And even in cases where this
might seem harmless, legitimizing pseudoscience can impede
genuine scientific progress. In a world where it's increasingly
difficult to tell fact from fiction, it's essential to keep your critical
thinking skills sharp. So the next time you hear
an amazing new claim, ask yourself: could we test this? Are the individuals behind this theory
updating their claims with new findings? Is this consistent with our broader
scientific understanding of the world? Because looking scientific
and actually being scientific are two very different things.

to criticism. Scientists should always be open
to the possibility that new observations could change
what they previously thought, and thoroughly disproven theories should
be rejected in favor of new explanations. Conversely, pseudoscientific theories are
often continually modified to explain away any contradictory results. This kind of behavior shows a resistance to what philosopher Helen Longino
calls transformative criticism. Pseudoscientific fields don't seek
to address their internal biases or meaningfully engage
in transparent peer review. Another key marker of science
is overall consistency. Science relies on a network
of shared information that ongoing research 
develops across disciplines. But pseudoscience often ignores
or denies this shared pool of data. For example, creationists claim
that animals didn’t evolve from a common ancestor, and that Earth is
less than 20,000 years old. But these claims contradict
huge amounts of evidence across multiple scientific disciplines, including geology, paleontology,
and biology. While the scientific method
is our most reliable tool to analyze empirical evidence
from the world around us, it certainly doesn't reveal everything
about the human condition. Faith-based beliefs can play an important
role in our lives and cultural traditions. But the reason it’s so important
to draw a line is that people often dress up
belief systems as science in efforts to manipulate others or undermine legitimate
scientific discoveries. And even in cases where this
might seem harmless, legitimizing pseudoscience can impede
genuine scientific progress. In a world where it's increasingly
difficult to tell fact from fiction, it's essential to keep your critical
thinking skills sharp. So the next time you hear
an amazing new claim, ask yourself: could we test this? Are the individuals behind this theory
updating their claims with new findings? Is this consistent with our broader
scientific understanding of the world? Because looking scientific
and actually being scientific are two very different things.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1700s, a German doctor named
Samuel Hahnemann began publishing articles about a new treatment
approach he called homeopathy. Hahnemann’s theory had
two central hypotheses. First, the treatment for an ailment
should be a dose of something that might cause that ailment. And second, diluted medicines are more
powerful than concentrated ones. So, a homeopathic remedy for insomnia might include an extremely diluted
solution of caffeine. Over the following 300 years, numerous physicians and patients
turned to homeopathy, and entire hospitals were built
to focus on homeopathic treatments. But despite all this, many studies have
shown that homeopathy has no therapeutic effect, and homeopathic treatments often
perform no better than placebos. So why do so many practitioners
and institutions still support this practice? The answer is that homeopathy
is a pseudoscience— a collection of theories, methods,
and assumptions that appear scientific,
but aren’t. In the worst cases, pseudoscience
practitioners encourage this confusion to exploit people. But even when they’re well-intentioned, pseudoscience still prevents people
from getting the help they need. So how are you supposed to tell what’s
science and what’s pseudoscience? This question is known as
the demarcation problem, and there's no easy answer. Part of the issue is that defining
science is surprisingly tricky. There's a common idea that all science
should, in some form or another, be related to testing
against empirical evidence. But some scientific activities
are primarily theoretical, and different disciplines
approach empiricism with varying goals, methodologies,
and standards. 20th century philosopher Karl Popper
tried to solve the demarcation problem with a simple rule. He argued that in order
for a theory to be scientific it must be falsifiable,
or able to be proven wrong. This requires a theory to make
specific predictions— for example, if you’re theorizing
that the Earth revolves around the Sun, you should be able to predict the path of
other celestial bodies in the night sky. This could then be disproven
based on whether or not your prediction corresponds
to your observations. Popper’s falsification criterion 
is a great way to identify pseudoscientific fields
like astrology, which makes overly broad predictions
that adapt to any observation. However, falsification alone doesn't
completely solve the demarcation issue. Many things we now consider science
were once untestable due to a lack of knowledge or technology. Fortunately, there are other factors
we can use to identify pseudoscience, including how a field responds
to criticism. Scientists should always be open
to the possibility that new observations could change
what they previously thought, and thoroughly disproven theories should
be rejected in favor of new explanations. Conversely, pseudoscientific theories are
often continually modified to explain away any contradictory results. This kind of behavior shows a resistance to what philosopher Helen Longino
calls transformative criticism. Pseudoscientific fields don't seek
to address their internal biases or meaningfully engage
in transparent peer review. Another key marker of science
is overall consistency. Science relies on a network
of shared information that ongoing research 
develops across disciplines. But pseudoscience often ignores
or denies this shared pool of data. For example, creationists claim
that animals didn’t evolve from a common ancestor, and that Earth is

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks to identify a discipline that is not a pseudoscience, with options including Astrology, Homeopathy, Creationism, and Astronomy.

The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 4: "What is pseudoscience, according to the transcript?" is related to the concept of pseudoscience. However, it does not ask to identify a discipline that is not a pseudoscience.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks to identify a scientific discipline or a characteristic of science. Among the generated MCQs, Question 8: "What is another key marker of science, according to the transcript?" is the most relevant, as it asks about a characteristic of science.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 7 or Question 8, as they both relate to the concept of science and pseudoscience. But since Question 8 is more focused on the characteristics of science, I would say that it is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
It's easy to imagine a world
without labor unions. We're essentially living
in that world now. And we are worse off as a result. Few of you probably belong to unions, but almost all of you benefit from them. It was unions that brought us the weekend. More importantly,
unions built the middle class by ensuring that workers
had the incomes to support families, to buy homes and cars, and to dream that their children
could do better than they could. It was union power and advocacy
that helped us win Social Security and health insurance
upon which almost all of us depend. In the 1950s, 33 percent of private-sector workers
belonged to unions. Big labor stood proudly
beside big business and big government. No more. Today, only six percent
of private sector workers are members of unions. With their decline in numbers came
a decline in political and economic power. And the result? A significant increase in inequality. A significant deterioration
in the possibility of a middle life -- A middle class lifestyle
for this generation or the next. And a receding chance to own
a home or afford retirement. We need unions to regain the power so that we can regain what we have lost, build a better future and help forge democracies that are built on a decent social contract
between citizens and government and among citizens themselves. Yes, we need unions today as much as ever. As a professor of political science, and someone who has studied
labor unions for a long time, I can tell you that one of the most
important things that unions do is to counterbalance
the power of corporations. They even the playing field. Yes, we need unions. But we need better and different unions that are more attuned to the 21st century. Let's picture the world before unions. Small children toiling all day
and even into the night in noisy, polluted factories. Or immigrant women workers
jumping from a burning sweatshop because the fire escapes were locked so that they could not take breaks. That was New York City in 1911, that's Bangladesh now. But unions changed that by winning protections for workers. They transformed lives. They enabled even the worst off
to achieve the American dream. Consider the longshore workers,
those who load and unload ships. In the morning, the boss came and yelled
all along the shore -- thus the name longshore. They pleaded for the scarce jobs, just as migrant day laborers do today
at places like Lowe's and Home Depot. It was humiliating, degrading. But when the unions won the right
to organize and won contracts, the wharf rats became lords of the dock. They became middle class. They could marry. They could support families, they could send their children to college, they had health insurance and benefits. They had dignity, respect. They were full American citizens. Unions enabled others
to attain the American dream by raising wages generally and by reducing wage disparities
between men and women and among the races. My research has shown me that with every transformation
in the economy, the technology, the way we work, there has been an evolution
in the labor movement. Craft unions, think construction work
or even beer making, emerged from medieval guilds. With the rise of industry --
auto, steel -- new forms of organization emerged. When white collar workers in offices,
in government, in health care in professions, won voice and representation, yet another kind of union developed. In my mind, in my ears, is Dolly Parton singing "9 to 5", inspired by a real-life
union of that name. When you hear that song, thank the unions for a decent working day. History shows that unions helped people
get dignity, rise out of poverty, inhibit workplace dangers and harassment and improve health
and well-being of us all. These are not yesterday's problems. Workers of today
still need and want unions. An MIT survey revealed that 50 percent
of the non-union workforce would join a union if given a chance. So, Margaret, if unions are so great, why are they in such serious decline? Because the odds are stacked against them. Many of you have read
about the Amazon warehouse workers who failed to win a union
representation election in Alabama. They failed because of concerted
employer opposition. Indeed, there are many
employers and politicians who are preventing
the reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy. These are laws that inhibit agriculture and domestic
workers from organizing, largely Black and brown workers. They make it hard for workers
in the gig economy to organize, those we call forth with our apps: rideshare, delivery service,
specialized tasks. There are employers and politicians
who are pushing states to pass “right-to-work” laws: laws that abolish the requirement that those who are covered by union
contracts have to pay union dues. This effectively kills the unions. Many workers in 27 states do not have to pay for the benefits
the unions provide for them. States that include Michigan,
Indiana and Wisconsin, former union strongholds. And society loses big. A recent study revealed
that in right-to-work law states, there is slower economic growth, higher consumer debt, lower wages, worse health outcomes
and lower civic participation than in states without such
laws on the books. But it's not just employers
and politicians that are holding unions back. Unions are a cause
of some of their own problems. Some unions are extremely bureaucratic, stifling debate and innovation. Some union leaders are corrupt. Rigging elections, paying themselves
humongous salaries, even when they represent
very low-income workers. And some commit felonies. Jimmy Hoffa is the notorious example
of a labor leader who went to prison. But just this year, several high-ranking officials
in the United Auto Workers were sentenced for embezzlement. Now, many critics, possibly some of you, blame unions for inflation. When wages go up, consumer prices go up. True enough, but so does the standard
of living for workers. And we as taxpayers benefit from higher standards
of living by workers. The pandemic gave us
the term "essential workers." If those in grocery, warehousing,
food processing, delivery, had strong unions,
indeed any unions at all, there would have been no need
for federal programs for those who have jobs to feed
their families and prevent evictions. Now there are many reasons
for union decline, including structural ones. The decline in union jobs
in manufacturing. But a major reason
is public lack of awareness, even misinformation
about the value of unions. Well before President Reagan fired the striking
air controllers in 1981, there has been concerted and continuous
opposition by employers and politicians to undermine unions. Employers no longer suppress unions by hiring private armies, like US Steel, Ford
and the coal companies did. Now they hire very high-priced
consulting firms to do that work. Elected officials may no longer
call out the police and the National Guard
to cart labor organizers off to jail. Now they pass legislation that restricts
union organizing and power. But workers are beginning to fight back as the headlines reveal. They are building solidarity
across racial, ethnic, religious, partisan divides. Martin Luther King [Jr.] exhorted us
to enwrap ourselves in a single garment of destiny. I have observed several unions
that I've studied build expanded and inclusive
communities of fate in which large numbers of others recognize that their destinies are entwined despite differences and distances. This doesn't always happen, but it can and it must. If you took my class,
or gave me another hour, I could give you numerous examples. We need as employees and citizens to build solidarity
through communities of fate that crosses geographies and differences. But to do that, we need to reimagine
labor unions for now. The labor movement must evolve
as it has in the past, even producing possibly alt unions,
alternatives to unions. Alternatives to traditional unions. Workers in gig professions, tech, don't necessarily want
a traditional union, but they do want influence
over their wages, working conditions and even the policies of their companies. And they are reimagining old approaches and coming up with new ones in order to build worker voice and power. Some are reconfiguring
worker cooperatives: employee-owned businesses, in which the workers determine wages, working conditions and distribution of profits. This is not a pipe dream. Mondragon in Spain
has over 80,000 employee owners, takes in over 13 billion dollars a year and redistributes its profits
to build worker skills and capacities among its member cooperatives. A newer approach is to use
platform technologies to teach workers their rights. In our global, hyperconnected
and socially isolating world, platforms such as coworker.org or Unit recognize and address the fact
that there is a mobile workforce that no longer has
water coolers or lunch rooms around which to gather and strategize. These platforms provide workers
with a way to share experiences, access organizing resources and build networks at scale
across geographies and employers. Coworker.org had a huge win with Alphabet, the parent company of Google, a giant among tech firms. Alphabet workers recognize
that they are part of a community of fate that crosses large distances. They have been protesting
Google's contracts with the Pentagon and with immigration authorities. They have normal run-of-the-mill
economic union demands, but they also have the political demand that they should have a say
over company policies that affect them and us. Now, whatever you thought
of unions in the past, I hope -- I hope that these examples
have revealed to you what they can be today and for tomorrow. Unions once significantly reduced
income inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor. They can again. These graph lines came together
when unions rose. I'd like to see those lines
permanently converge and inequality reduced once and for all. Billionaires are building
rockets to explore outer space. This is so exciting, but equally exciting are the workers who are providing
the goods and services on which those billionaires
[and] we all depend, exploring new ways
to gain power and voice. If even some of these
explorations succeed, workers will gain dignity, economic security and the power to challenge
employers and politicians. The result? The resuscitation of the middle class and a far more equitable society. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
It's easy to imagine a world
without labor unions. We're essentially living
in that world now. And we are worse off as a result. Few of you probably belong to unions, but almost all of you benefit from them. It was unions that brought us the weekend. More importantly,
unions built the middle class by ensuring that workers
had the incomes to support families, to buy homes and cars, and to dream that their children
could do better than they could. It was union power and advocacy
that helped us win Social Security and health insurance
upon which almost all of us depend. In the 1950s, 33 percent of private-sector workers
belonged to unions. Big labor stood proudly
beside big business and big government. No more. Today, only six percent
of private sector workers are members of unions. With their decline in numbers came
a decline in political and economic power. And the result? A significant increase in inequality. A significant deterioration
in the possibility of a middle life -- A middle class lifestyle
for this generation or the next. And a receding chance to own
a home or afford retirement. We need unions to regain the power so that we can regain what we have lost, build a better future and help forge democracies that are built on a decent social contract
between citizens and government and among citizens themselves. Yes, we need unions today as much as ever. As a professor of political science, and someone who has studied
labor unions for a long time, I can tell you that one of the most
important things that unions do is to counterbalance
the power of corporations. They even the playing field. Yes, we need unions. But we need better and different unions that are more attuned to the 21st century. Let's picture the world before unions. Small children toiling all day
and even into the night in noisy, polluted factories. Or immigrant women workers
jumping from a burning sweatshop because the fire escapes were locked so that they could not take breaks. That was New York City in 1911, that's Bangladesh now. But unions changed that by winning protections for workers. They transformed lives. They enabled even the worst off
to achieve the American dream. Consider the longshore workers,
those who load and unload ships. In the morning, the boss came and yelled
all along the shore -- thus the name longshore. They pleaded for the scarce jobs, just as migrant day laborers do today
at places like Lowe's and Home Depot. It was humiliating, degrading. But when the unions won the right
to organize and won contracts, the wharf rats became lords of the dock. They became middle class. They could marry. They could support families, they could send their children to college, they had health insurance and benefits. They had dignity, respect. They were full American citizens. Unions enabled others
to attain the American dream by raising wages generally and by reducing wage disparities
between men and women and among the races. My research has shown me that with every transformation
in the economy, the technology, the way we work, there has been an evolution
in the labor movement. Craft unions, think construction work
or even beer making, emerged from medieval guilds. With the rise of industry --
auto, steel -- new forms of organization emerged. When white collar workers in offices,
in government, in health care in professions, won voice and representation, yet another kind of union developed. In my mind, in my ears, is Dolly Parton singing "9 to 5", inspired by a real-life
union of that name. When you hear that song, thank the unions for a decent working day. History shows that unions helped people
get dignity, rise out of poverty, inhibit workplace dangers and harassment and improve health
and well-being of us all. These are not yesterday's problems. Workers of today
still need and want unions. An MIT survey revealed that 50 percent
of the non-union workforce would join a union if given a chance. So, Margaret, if unions are so great, why are they in such serious decline? Because the odds are stacked against them. Many of you have read
about the Amazon warehouse workers who failed to win a union
representation election in Alabama. They failed because of concerted
employer opposition. Indeed, there are many
employers and politicians who are preventing
the reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy. These are laws that inhibit agriculture and domestic
workers from organizing, largely Black and brown workers. They make it hard for workers
in the gig economy to organize, those we call forth with our apps: rideshare, delivery service,
specialized tasks. There are employers and politicians
who are pushing states to pass “right-to-work” laws: laws that abolish the requirement that those who are covered by union
contracts have to pay union dues. This effectively kills the unions. Many workers in 27 states do not have to pay for the benefits
the unions provide for them. States that include Michigan,
Indiana and Wisconsin, former union strongholds. And society loses big. A recent study revealed
that in right-to-work law states, there is slower economic growth, higher consumer debt, lower wages, worse health outcomes
and lower civic participation than in states without such
laws on the books. But it's not just employers
and politicians that are holding unions back. Unions are a cause
of some of their own problems. Some unions are extremely bureaucratic, stifling debate and innovation. Some union leaders are corrupt. Rigging elections, paying themselves
humongous salaries, even when they represent
very low-income workers. And some commit felonies. Jimmy Hoffa is the notorious example
of a labor leader who went to prison. But just this year, several high-ranking officials
in the United Auto Workers were sentenced for embezzlement. Now, many critics, possibly some of you, blame unions for inflation. When wages go up, consumer prices go up. True enough, but so does the standard
of living for workers. And we as taxpayers benefit from higher standards
of living by workers. The pandemic gave us
the term "essential workers." If those in grocery, warehousing,
food processing, delivery, had strong unions,
indeed any unions at all, there would have been no need
for federal programs for those who have jobs to feed
their families and prevent evictions. Now there are many reasons
for union decline, including structural ones. The decline in union jobs
in manufacturing. But a major reason
is public lack of awareness, even misinformation
about the value of unions. Well before President Reagan fired the striking
air controllers in 1981, there has been concerted and continuous
opposition by employers and politicians to undermine unions. Employers no longer suppress unions by hiring private armies, like US Steel, Ford
and the coal companies did. Now they hire very high-priced
consulting firms to do that work. Elected officials may no longer
call out the police and the National Guard
to cart labor organizers off to jail. Now they pass legislation that restricts
union organizing and power. But workers are beginning to fight back as the headlines reveal. They are building solidarity
across racial, ethnic, religious, partisan divides. Martin Luther King [Jr.] exhorted us
to enwrap ourselves in a single garment of destiny. I have observed several unions
that I've studied build expanded and inclusive
communities of fate in which large numbers of others recognize that their destinies are entwined despite differences and distances. This doesn't always happen, but it can and it must. If you took my class,
or gave me another hour, I could give you numerous examples. We need as employees and citizens to build solidarity
through communities of fate that crosses geographies and differences. But to do that, we need to reimagine
labor unions for now. The labor movement must evolve
as it has in the past, even producing possibly alt unions,
alternatives to unions. Alternatives to traditional unions. Workers in gig professions, tech, don't necessarily want
a traditional union, but they do want influence
over their wages, working conditions and even the policies of their companies. And they are reimagining old approaches and coming up with new ones in order to build worker voice and power. Some are reconfiguring
worker cooperatives: employee-owned businesses, in which the workers determine wages, working conditions and distribution of profits. This is not a pipe dream. Mondragon in Spain
has over 80,000 employee owners, takes in over 13 billion dollars a year and redistributes its profits
to build worker skills and capacities among its member cooperatives. A newer approach is to use
platform technologies to teach workers their rights. In our global, hyperconnected
and socially isolating world, platforms such as coworker.org or Unit recognize and address the fact
that there is a mobile workforce that no longer has
water coolers or lunch rooms around which to gather and strategize. These platforms provide workers
with a way to share experiences, access organizing resources and build networks at scale
across geographies and employers. Coworker.org had a huge win with Alphabet, the parent company of Google, a giant among tech firms. Alphabet workers recognize
that they are part of a community of fate that crosses large distances. They have been protesting
Google's contracts with the Pentagon and with immigration authorities. They have normal run-of-the-mill
economic union demands, but they also have the political demand that they should have a say
over company policies that affect them and us. Now, whatever you thought

have revealed to you what they can be today and for tomorrow. Unions once significantly reduced
income inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor. They can again. These graph lines came together

permanently converge and inequality reduced once and for all. Billionaires are building

However, I can suggest that Question 2 is somewhat similar in content, as it asks about the percentage of private sector workers that belonged to unions in the 1950s. Although the topic is different, the question format and content are similar.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2. However, please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not cover the same topic as the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
At dawn on July 29th, 1364,
John Hawkwood— an English soldier turned
contract mercenary— led a surprise attack against an army
of sleeping Florentine mercenaries. The enemy commander quickly awoke 
and gathered his men to launch a counterattack. But as soon as the defending army
was ready to fight, Hawkwood’s fighters simply turned
and walked away. This wasn't an act of cowardice. These mercenaries, known as condottieri, had simply done just enough fighting
to fulfill their contracts. And for Italy’s condottieri,
war wasn’t about glory or conquest: it was purely about getting paid. For much of the 14th and 15th centuries,
the condottieri dominated Italian warfare, profiting from— and encouraging—
the region’s intense political rivalries. The most powerful of these regions were
ruled either by wealthy representatives of the Catholic Church or merchants who’d grown rich
from international trade. These rulers competed
for power and prestige by working to attract the most talented
artists and thinkers to their courts, leading to a cultural explosion
now known as the Italian Renaissance. But local rivalries also played 
out in military conflicts, fought almost entirely by the condottieri. Many of these elite mercenaries were
veterans of the Hundred Years’ War, hailing from France and England. When that war reached
a temporary truce in 1360, some soldiers began pillaging
France in search of fortune. And the riches they found 
in Catholic churches drew their raiding parties to the center
of the Church’s operations: Italy. But here, savvy ruling merchants
saw these bandits’ arrival as a golden opportunity. By hiring the soldiers as mercenaries, they could control the violence
and gain an experienced army without the cost of outfitting
and training locals. The mercenaries liked this deal as well,
as it offered regular income and the ability to play these rulers
off each other for their own benefit. Of course, these soldiers had
to be kept on a tight leash. Rulers forced them to sign
elaborate contracts, or condotta, a word that became synonymous
with the mercenaries themselves. Divisions of payment, distribution
of plunder, non-compete agreements— it was all spelled out clearly, making war merely another
dimension of business. Contracts specified the number of men
a commander would provide, and the resulting armies ranged
from a few hundred to several thousand. Individual soldiers regularly moved
between armies in search of higher payments. And when their contracts expired, condottieri commanders became free agents
with no expectation of ongoing loyalty. When John Hawkwood launched his
surprise attack against the Florentine condottieri, he was working for Pisa. Later, he would fight for Florence
and many of Pisa’s other enemies. But regardless of who was
contracting them, the condottieri fought primarily
for themselves. Their extensive military experience
allowed them to avoid taking unnecessary risks
in the heat of battle. And— while still deadly— their clashes
rarely led to crushing victories or defeats. Condottieri commanders wanted battles
to be inconclusive— after all, if they established peace,
they’d put themselves out of business. So even when one side did win, enemy combatants were typically held
hostage and released to fight another day. But there was nothing merciful
about these decisions. Contracts could just as easily turn them
into ruthless killers, as in 1377, when Hawkwood led the massacre
of a famine-stricken town who’d tried to revolt
against the local government. Over time, foreign condottieri were
increasingly replaced by native Italians. For young men from humble origins, war-for-profit offered an attractive
alternative to farming or the church. And this new generation of condottieri
leveraged their military power into political influence, in some cases even founding
ruling dynasties. However, despite cornering the market on
Italian warfare for nearly two centuries, the condottieri only truly excelled
at engaging in just enough close-range combat 
to fulfill their contracts. Over time, they became outclassed
by the gunpowder weaponry of France and Spain’s
large standing armies, as well as the naval might
of the Ottomans. By the mid 16th century, these state-sponsored militaries forced
all of Europe into a new era of warfare, putting an end to the condottieri’s
conniving war games.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Generated MCQ 8: What was the impact of the condottieri on Italian society and politics?**

Although the question itself does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, one of its options (B. They contributed to the growth of the Italian Renaissance) aligns with the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ (A. The Renaissance). The other generated MCQs do not have options that directly match the ground truth MCQ's options.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based solely on the question's intent and content, I would suggest:

**Generated MCQ 8 is not the best match**

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the historical era coinciding with the heyday of the condottieri.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question. However, I can try to find a generated MCQ that mentions the Renaissance or a related historical era.

In this case, I would suggest:

**Transcript**:
At dawn on July 29th, 1364,
John Hawkwood— an English soldier turned
contract mercenary— led a surprise attack against an army
of sleeping Florentine mercenaries. The enemy commander quickly awoke 
and gathered his men to launch a counterattack. But as soon as the defending army
was ready to fight, Hawkwood’s fighters simply turned
and walked away. This wasn't an act of cowardice. These mercenaries, known as condottieri, had simply done just enough fighting
to fulfill their contracts. And for Italy’s condottieri,
war wasn’t about glory or conquest: it was purely about getting paid. For much of the 14th and 15th centuries,
the condottieri dominated Italian warfare, profiting from— and encouraging—
the region’s intense political rivalries. The most powerful of these regions were
ruled either by wealthy representatives of the Catholic Church or merchants who’d grown rich
from international trade. These rulers competed
for power and prestige by working to attract the most talented
artists and thinkers to their courts, leading to a cultural explosion
now known as the Italian Renaissance. But local rivalries also played 
out in military conflicts, fought almost entirely by the condottieri. Many of these elite mercenaries were
veterans of the Hundred Years’ War, hailing from France and England. When that war reached
a temporary truce in 1360, some soldiers began pillaging
France in search of fortune. And the riches they found 
in Catholic churches drew their raiding parties to the center
of the Church’s operations: Italy. But here, savvy ruling merchants
saw these bandits’ arrival as a golden opportunity. By hiring the soldiers as mercenaries, they could control the violence
and gain an experienced army without the cost of outfitting
and training locals. The mercenaries liked this deal as well,
as it offered regular income and the ability to play these rulers
off each other for their own benefit. Of course, these soldiers had
to be kept on a tight leash. Rulers forced them to sign
elaborate contracts, or condotta, a word that became synonymous
with the mercenaries themselves. Divisions of payment, distribution
of plunder, non-compete agreements— it was all spelled out clearly, making war merely another
dimension of business. Contracts specified the number of men
a commander would provide, and the resulting armies ranged
from a few hundred to several thousand. Individual soldiers regularly moved
between armies in search of higher payments. And when their contracts expired, condottieri commanders became free agents
with no expectation of ongoing loyalty. When John Hawkwood launched his
surprise attack against the Florentine condottieri, he was working for Pisa. Later, he would fight for Florence
and many of Pisa’s other enemies. But regardless of who was
contracting them, the condottieri fought primarily
for themselves. Their extensive military experience
allowed them to avoid taking unnecessary risks
in the heat of battle. And— while still deadly— their clashes
rarely led to crushing victories or defeats. Condottieri commanders wanted battles
to be inconclusive— after all, if they established peace,
they’d put themselves out of business. So even when one side did win, enemy combatants were typically held
hostage and released to fight another day. But there was nothing merciful
about these decisions. Contracts could just as easily turn them
into ruthless killers, as in 1377, when Hawkwood led the massacre
of a famine-stricken town who’d tried to revolt
against the local government. Over time, foreign condottieri were
increasingly replaced by native Italians. For young men from humble origins, war-for-profit offered an attractive
alternative to farming or the church. And this new generation of condottieri
leveraged their military power into political influence, in some cases even founding
ruling dynasties. However, despite cornering the market on
Italian warfare for nearly two centuries, the condottieri only truly excelled
at engaging in just enough close-range combat 
to fulfill their contracts. Over time, they became outclassed
by the gunpowder weaponry of France and Spain’s
large standing armies, as well as the naval might
of the Ottomans. By the mid 16th century, these state-sponsored militaries forced
all of Europe into a new era of warfare, putting an end to the condottieri’s
conniving war games.

**Transcript**:
From the 1650s through the late 1800s, European colonists descended
on South Africa. First, Dutch and later British forces
sought to claim the region for themselves, with their struggle becoming
even more aggressive after discovering the area’s
abundant natural resources. In their ruthless scramble, both colonial powers violently removed
numerous Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Yet despite these conflicts, the colonizers often claimed
they were settling in empty land devoid of local people. These reports were corroborated
in letters and travelogues by various administrators,
soldiers, and missionaries. Maps were drawn reflecting these claims, and prominent British historians
supported this narrative. Publications codifying the so-called
Empty Land Theory had three central arguments. First, most of the land
being settled by Europeans had no established communities
or agricultural infrastructure. Second, any African communities
that were in those regions had actually entered the area
at the same time as Europeans, so they didn’t have an ancestral claim
to the land. And third, since these African communities
had probably stolen the land from earlier, 
no-longer-present Indigenous people, the Europeans were within their rights
to displace these African settlers. The problem is that all three of these
arguments were completely false. Almost none of this land was empty
and Africans had lived here for millennia. Indigenous South Africans
simply had a different practice of land ownership 
from the Dutch and British. Land belonged to families or groups,
not individuals. And even that ownership
was more focused on the land’s agricultural products
than the land itself. Community leaders would distribute
seasonal land rights, allowing various nomadic groups
to graze cattle or forage for vegetation. Even the groups that did live
in large agricultural settlements didn’t believe they owned the land
as private property. But the colonizing Europeans had
no respect for this system of ownership. They concluded the land
belonged to no one and could therefore be divided
amongst themselves. In this context, claims that
the land was “empty” were an ignorant oversimplification
of a much more complex reality. But the Empty Land Theory allowed
British academics to rewrite history and minimize native populations. In 1894, the European parliament
in Cape Town took this exploitation even further
by passing the Glen Grey Act. This decree made it
functionally impossible for native Africans to own land, shattering the system of collective
tribal ownership and creating a class of landless people. To justify the theft, Europeans painted
the locals as barbarians who lacked the capacity for reason and were better off being ruled
by the colonizers. This strategy of stripping locals
of their right to ancestral lands and casting native people as savages has
been employed by many colonizers. Now known as the Empty Land Myth, this is a well-established technique
in the colonial playbook, and its impact can be found 
in the history of many countries, including Australia, Canada,
and the United States. And in South Africa, the influence 
of this narrative can be traced directly to a brutal campaign
of institutionalized racism. Barred from their lands, the once self-sufficient population
struggled as migrant laborers and miners on European-owned property. The law forbade them from working
certain skilled jobs, and forced Africans to live
in racially segregated areas. Over time,
these racist policies intensified, mandating separation in urban areas, restricting voting rights,
and eventually building to apartheid. Under this system,
African people had no voting rights, and the education of native Africans 
was overhauled to emphasize their legal and social
subservience to white settlers. This state of legally enforced racism
persisted through the early 1990s, and throughout this period, colonists frequently invoked
the Empty Land Theory to justify the unequal distribution
of land. South African resistance movements
fought throughout the 20th century to gain political and economic freedom. And since the 1980s, South African
scholars have been using archaeological evidence
to correct the historical record. Today, South African schools are finally
teaching the region's true history. But the legacy of the Empty Land Myth
still persists as one of the most harmful stories
ever told.

amongst themselves. In this context, claims that
the land was “empty” were an ignorant oversimplification
of a much more complex reality. But the Empty Land Theory allowed
British academics to rewrite history and minimize native populations. In 1894, the European parliament
in Cape Town took this exploitation even further
by passing the Glen Grey Act. This decree made it
functionally impossible for native Africans to own land, shattering the system of collective
tribal ownership and creating a class of landless people. To justify the theft, Europeans painted
the locals as barbarians who lacked the capacity for reason and were better off being ruled
by the colonizers. This strategy of stripping locals
of their right to ancestral lands and casting native people as savages has
been employed by many colonizers. Now known as the Empty Land Myth, this is a well-established technique
in the colonial playbook, and its impact can be found 
in the history of many countries, including Australia, Canada,
and the United States. And in South Africa, the influence 
of this narrative can be traced directly to a brutal campaign
of institutionalized racism. Barred from their lands, the once self-sufficient population
struggled as migrant laborers and miners on European-owned property. The law forbade them from working
certain skilled jobs, and forced Africans to live
in racially segregated areas. Over time,
these racist policies intensified, mandating separation in urban areas, restricting voting rights,
and eventually building to apartheid. Under this system,
African people had no voting rights, and the education of native Africans 
was overhauled to emphasize their legal and social
subservience to white settlers. This state of legally enforced racism
persisted through the early 1990s, and throughout this period, colonists frequently invoked
the Empty Land Theory to justify the unequal distribution
of land. South African resistance movements
fought throughout the 20th century to gain political and economic freedom. And since the 1980s, South African
scholars have been using archaeological evidence
to correct the historical record. Today, South African schools are finally
teaching the region's true history. But the legacy of the Empty Land Myth
still persists as one of the most harmful stories
ever told.

**Transcript**:
From the 1650s through the late 1800s, European colonists descended
on South Africa. First, Dutch and later British forces
sought to claim the region for themselves, with their struggle becoming
even more aggressive after discovering the area’s
abundant natural resources. In their ruthless scramble, both colonial powers violently removed
numerous Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Yet despite these conflicts, the colonizers often claimed
they were settling in empty land devoid of local people. These reports were corroborated
in letters and travelogues by various administrators,
soldiers, and missionaries. Maps were drawn reflecting these claims, and prominent British historians
supported this narrative. Publications codifying the so-called
Empty Land Theory had three central arguments. First, most of the land
being settled by Europeans had no established communities
or agricultural infrastructure. Second, any African communities
that were in those regions had actually entered the area
at the same time as Europeans, so they didn’t have an ancestral claim
to the land. And third, since these African communities
had probably stolen the land from earlier, 
no-longer-present Indigenous people, the Europeans were within their rights
to displace these African settlers. The problem is that all three of these
arguments were completely false. Almost none of this land was empty
and Africans had lived here for millennia. Indigenous South Africans
simply had a different practice of land ownership 
from the Dutch and British. Land belonged to families or groups,
not individuals. And even that ownership
was more focused on the land’s agricultural products
than the land itself. Community leaders would distribute
seasonal land rights, allowing various nomadic groups
to graze cattle or forage for vegetation. Even the groups that did live
in large agricultural settlements didn’t believe they owned the land
as private property. But the colonizing Europeans had
no respect for this system of ownership. They concluded the land
belonged to no one and could therefore be divided
amongst themselves. In this context, claims that
the land was “empty” were an ignorant oversimplification

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 3: How did the Indigenous South Africans practice land ownership, and how did it differ from the European system?**

Although this question does not directly ask why the arguments used to support the Empty Land Theory were false, it does address the underlying issue of land ownership and the differences between the Indigenous South African and European systems. The correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (Option B: African people had been moving southwards into South Africa for millennia) is related to the fact that Indigenous South Africans had a different practice of land ownership, which is addressed in Question 3.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and options. Question 3 is the closest match, but it still requires some inference and connection-making to link it to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

**Index: 3**

Please keep in mind that this is an approximate match, and a more direct match would be ideal.

African people had no voting rights, and the education of native Africans 
was overhauled to emphasize their legal and social
subservience to white settlers. This state of legally enforced racism
persisted through the early 1990s, and throughout this period, colonists frequently invoked
the Empty Land Theory to justify the unequal distribution
of land. South African resistance movements
fought throughout the 20th century to gain political and economic freedom. And since the 1980s, South African
scholars have been using archaeological evidence
to correct the historical record. Today, South African schools are finally
teaching the region's true history. But the legacy of the Empty Land Myth
still persists as one of the most harmful stories
ever told.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about TV residuals, which refers to the financial compensation that writers, actors, and other creatives receive for the reuse of their work, such as when a TV episode is rerun.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them are directly related to TV residuals or the entertainment industry. However, some of them touch on concepts related to finance, economics, and compensation.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5: "What is the concept of opportunity cost?" is the closest match. Opportunity cost refers to the cost of choosing one option over another, which could be related to the concept of residuals in the sense that creatives may choose to work on a project that offers residuals over one that does not.

However, this is a very loose connection, and I would not say that Question 5 is a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 5 (Note: This is a very weak match, and I would not recommend using this question as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ.)

**Transcript**:
In 2018, an orca called
Tahlequah gave birth. But her daughter died within an hour. Tahlequah, however, didn’t leave her body. And over the next 17 days 
and 1,600 kilometers, she kept it afloat atop her own, diving to retrieve the body 
whenever it slipped away, even after it began deteriorating. By altering her feeding 
and travel patterns, Tahlequah’s behavior
was certainly unusual. But was she mourning— or just confused? Do non-human animals grieve? This question is tricky. In 1871, Charles Darwin argued
that other animals experience a wide range of emotions,
including grief. But, especially in the absence 
of a dependable bridge between our minds and theirs, many scientists have long been wary of projecting human emotions
onto other animals. It’s also been thought that they might
display irregular behaviors after a death for other adaptive reasons. And, for a while, the paradigm was
that humans were exceptional: other animals were reacting and surviving, while we alone were thinking and feeling. This conception was increasingly
challenged during the 20th century. In 1985, for example, 
a gorilla called Koko, who'd been trained to use some signs
from American Sign Language, was told that her kitten
companion had died. She made distress calls,
and several weeks later, looking at a photo of another kitten
signed “cry,” “sad,” and “frown.” Now there’s a growing pool
of data and observations suggesting that some animals,
including mammals and birds, might experience what we call grief. In 2003, Eleanor, 
an elephant matriarch, collapsed. Within minutes, another matriarch called
Grace neared and helped Eleanor stand, only for her to fall again. Grace vocalized, stayed by Eleanor’s side,
and tried pushing her back up. When Eleanor died,
a female named Maui approached, positioned herself over Eleanor’s body,
and rocked back and forth. Over the course of one week, elephants from five different families
visited Eleanor’s body. On separate occasions, elephants have been observed carrying
the remains of family members, including jawbones and tusks. In 2010, a giraffe was born with a
deformed foot and had trouble walking. The calf lived just four weeks. On the day the calf died,
22 other females and four juveniles closely attended and occasionally
nuzzled the body. On the third morning, the mother
was alone and still not eating, which giraffes usually do constantly. Instead, she stayed by her dead calf,
even after hyenas ate away at the body. Scientists have also begun quantitatively
assessing other animals’ responses to death. In 2006, researchers analyzed
baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids, stress hormones that spike
when humans are bereaved. They compared the samples from females
who had lost a close relative in a predator attack 
with those who hadn’t. And they found that the glucocorticoid
levels of baboons who had were significantly higher the month
following the death. Those baboons then increased
their grooming behavior and the number of their grooming partners, broadening and strengthening
their social networks. Within two months, their glucocorticoid
levels returned to the baseline. Researchers have also observed primate
mothers engaging in apparently contradictory behaviors while carrying
their dead children. Like switching between cannibalizing
or dragging their child’s corpse and carefully carrying or grooming it, suggesting that the mothers were
experiencing conflicting impulses towards the bodies. Our current understanding 
of the emotional landscapes of other animals is severely limited. To get a better grasp on mourning
in the animal kingdom, we need a lot more research. But where does this leave us for now? Conversations around whether non-human
animals experience emotions, like grief, can be emotional, in part because their outcomes
have very real implications— like determining if orcas should be
isolated and kept in captivity, or whether dairy cows should be separated
from their newborn calves. Until we do have more data on the subject, should we treat non-human animals like
they may have the capacity to grieve? Or assume they don’t? Which belief could cause more harm?

**Transcript**:
In 2018, an orca called
Tahlequah gave birth. But her daughter died within an hour. Tahlequah, however, didn’t leave her body. And over the next 17 days 
and 1,600 kilometers, she kept it afloat atop her own, diving to retrieve the body 
whenever it slipped away, even after it began deteriorating. By altering her feeding 
and travel patterns, Tahlequah’s behavior
was certainly unusual. But was she mourning— or just confused? Do non-human animals grieve? This question is tricky. In 1871, Charles Darwin argued
that other animals experience a wide range of emotions,
including grief. But, especially in the absence 
of a dependable bridge between our minds and theirs, many scientists have long been wary of projecting human emotions
onto other animals. It’s also been thought that they might
display irregular behaviors after a death for other adaptive reasons. And, for a while, the paradigm was
that humans were exceptional: other animals were reacting and surviving, while we alone were thinking and feeling. This conception was increasingly
challenged during the 20th century. In 1985, for example, 
a gorilla called Koko, who'd been trained to use some signs
from American Sign Language, was told that her kitten
companion had died. She made distress calls,
and several weeks later, looking at a photo of another kitten
signed “cry,” “sad,” and “frown.” Now there’s a growing pool
of data and observations suggesting that some animals,
including mammals and birds, might experience what we call grief. In 2003, Eleanor, 
an elephant matriarch, collapsed. Within minutes, another matriarch called
Grace neared and helped Eleanor stand, only for her to fall again. Grace vocalized, stayed by Eleanor’s side,
and tried pushing her back up. When Eleanor died,
a female named Maui approached, positioned herself over Eleanor’s body,
and rocked back and forth. Over the course of one week, elephants from five different families
visited Eleanor’s body. On separate occasions, elephants have been observed carrying
the remains of family members, including jawbones and tusks. In 2010, a giraffe was born with a
deformed foot and had trouble walking. The calf lived just four weeks. On the day the calf died,
22 other females and four juveniles closely attended and occasionally
nuzzled the body. On the third morning, the mother
was alone and still not eating, which giraffes usually do constantly. Instead, she stayed by her dead calf,
even after hyenas ate away at the body. Scientists have also begun quantitatively
assessing other animals’ responses to death. In 2006, researchers analyzed
baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids, stress hormones that spike
when humans are bereaved. They compared the samples from females
who had lost a close relative in a predator attack 
with those who hadn’t. And they found that the glucocorticoid
levels of baboons who had were significantly higher the month
following the death. Those baboons then increased
their grooming behavior and the number of their grooming partners, broadening and strengthening
their social networks. Within two months, their glucocorticoid
levels returned to the baseline. Researchers have also observed primate
mothers engaging in apparently contradictory behaviors while carrying
their dead children. Like switching between cannibalizing
or dragging their child’s corpse and carefully carrying or grooming it, suggesting that the mothers were
experiencing conflicting impulses towards the bodies. Our current understanding 
of the emotional landscapes of other animals is severely limited. To get a better grasp on mourning
in the animal kingdom, we need a lot more research. But where does this leave us for now? Conversations around whether non-human
animals experience emotions, like grief, can be emotional, in part because their outcomes
have very real implications— like determining if orcas should be
isolated and kept in captivity, or whether dairy cows should be separated
from their newborn calves. Until we do have more data on the subject, should we treat non-human animals like
they may have the capacity to grieve? Or assume they don’t? Which belief could cause more harm?

**Transcript**:
Your time traveling has caused a few
issues with the space-time continuum, like your old high school bully, Riff,
now ruling the future with an iron fist. You and the professor have driven
your hovering DeLorean back to the past to undo your own meddling. But shortly after you fix your mistakes, another DeLorean appears
and crashes into yours. Out step older versions
of you and the professor, who apparently had the same idea
from somewhere else in the timeline. The professors panic and explain
that the universe could collapse now that you’re both 
in the same time and place. The only hope is to merge the time streams
by having each version of you simultaneously time travel home. You both have plenty of fuel, but the crash broke your
chrono-stabilizing gyroscopes and your cars can only time travel
under very specific circumstances. Each of you will need to drive
a mile south, then a mile east, and then a mile north to get
the gyroscopes into temporal alignment. That would be easy, except each calibration requires placing
a portable time gate at your starting point, then driving into it at the precise end of
your three mile drive without it moving. Not only that, but your two time gates
must be placed at least 100 miles apart so their signals don’t interfere. In other words, you need to find two
different locations where you can drive a mile south, a mile east,
and then a mile north and end up exactly where you started. The professors are about to show you where
you can do this when they vanish, becoming victims 
of the collapsing timeline. It’s up to you now: where can you place the time gates? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If the earth were flat, there would
be no way to solve this riddle. What you need is some way to use the
sphericalness of the planet, some of its notable features, and the fact that lines of latitude aren’t
really lines— they’re circles. The equator is the biggest of these
circles, but it doesn’t do much for you, and you can’t even go south
from the South Pole. But let's try the North Pole. When you go a mile south, you'll be
on a circle that runs east west. After a mile east, you’re still
on that same circle, so the final mile north brings you 
back to your starting point. Perfect. That’s one gate down, but where
should you place the second? Well, the nice thing about circles is
that if you travel on them far enough, you come back to where you started. If there were a circle that had
a circumference of one mile, that would work marvelously. You could drive south a mile to reach it,
make the one mile rotation east, then go north a mile to return
to where you started. Such a circle does exist just
north of the South Pole. To find your starting point, you can use the standard formula
for the circumference of a circle. If you wanted to be absolutely precise, you could use an equation
that takes into account the roughly spherical shape of the Earth. But an area this small is

**Transcript**:
Your time traveling has caused a few
issues with the space-time continuum, like your old high school bully, Riff,
now ruling the future with an iron fist. You and the professor have driven
your hovering DeLorean back to the past to undo your own meddling. But shortly after you fix your mistakes, another DeLorean appears
and crashes into yours. Out step older versions
of you and the professor, who apparently had the same idea
from somewhere else in the timeline. The professors panic and explain
that the universe could collapse now that you’re both 
in the same time and place. The only hope is to merge the time streams
by having each version of you simultaneously time travel home. You both have plenty of fuel, but the crash broke your
chrono-stabilizing gyroscopes and your cars can only time travel
under very specific circumstances. Each of you will need to drive
a mile south, then a mile east, and then a mile north to get
the gyroscopes into temporal alignment. That would be easy, except each calibration requires placing
a portable time gate at your starting point, then driving into it at the precise end of
your three mile drive without it moving. Not only that, but your two time gates
must be placed at least 100 miles apart so their signals don’t interfere. In other words, you need to find two
different locations where you can drive a mile south, a mile east,
and then a mile north and end up exactly where you started. The professors are about to show you where
you can do this when they vanish, becoming victims 
of the collapsing timeline. It’s up to you now: where can you place the time gates? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If the earth were flat, there would
be no way to solve this riddle. What you need is some way to use the
sphericalness of the planet, some of its notable features, and the fact that lines of latitude aren’t
really lines— they’re circles. The equator is the biggest of these
circles, but it doesn’t do much for you, and you can’t even go south
from the South Pole. But let's try the North Pole. When you go a mile south, you'll be
on a circle that runs east west. After a mile east, you’re still
on that same circle, so the final mile north brings you 
back to your starting point. Perfect. That’s one gate down, but where
should you place the second? Well, the nice thing about circles is
that if you travel on them far enough, you come back to where you started. If there were a circle that had
a circumference of one mile, that would work marvelously. You could drive south a mile to reach it,
make the one mile rotation east, then go north a mile to return
to where you started. Such a circle does exist just
north of the South Pole. To find your starting point, you can use the standard formula
for the circumference of a circle. If you wanted to be absolutely precise, you could use an equation
that takes into account the roughly spherical shape of the Earth. But an area this small is
so close to being flat that the standard formula gives a solution
within a fraction of an inch of the actual distance. A circle with a one mile circumference has
a radius of just under 0.16 miles, so any point on the circle 
one mile north of that will be suitable for your time gate. In fact, there are other answers too: start a little further south, and you could travel east around the

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ is about using the standard formula C=2πr to find the second starting point, and the correct option is that accounting for the curvature of the Earth creates a difference so small it can be ignored.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is about the formula used to find the starting point for the second time gate. Although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same concept.

However, since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. But if I had to choose one based on the closest relation to the concept, I would suggest Question 7.

To provide a more accurate match, I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely align with the ground truth MCQ.

Welcome one and all! It’s time to grab your seat
for the biggest battle in the soon-to-be-formed universe. That’s right— 
the Big Bang is about to go down! In one corner is the force that brings
all matter together. It acts on any particle with mass,
and its range is infinite— give it up for gravity! In the other corner, our contender can
push matter away with spectacular strength. When the going gets tough,
this fighter just gets tougher. That’s right, it’s pressure! Over the next several
hundred thousand years, these two contenders will be wrestling
for the fate of the universe. That’s right folks, the ripple effects
of this historic match will shape the structure of the universe
as we know it today. But what are these powers fighting over? We’ll find out when the Big Bang
hits right... now! Let’s zoom in for the play-by-play. This epic event has brought three
components into our infant universe. Dark matter, which only interacts
with gravity. Baryonic matter, which makes
up all matter you’ve ever seen, is affected by both gravity and pressure. And radiation composed 
of innumerable particles of light, also known as photons. In the moments just after the Big Bang, all three components are in equilibrium, meaning no one location
is denser than another. But as the universe starts expanding,
differences in density start to emerge. Gravity immediately gets to work
pulling matter together. Dark matter begins to collect
at the center of these increasingly
dense regions, forming the foundations
of future galaxies. Meanwhile, pressure begins gathering
its strength. In this hot, high-energy environment, protons and electrons can’t come
together to form atoms, so these loose particles zip around,
freely interacting with ambient photons. The result is almost a fluid
of baryonic matter and radiation. But the closer these baryonic particles
get, the hotter the fluid becomes, pushing photons to ping
around with incredible force. This is the power of pressure,
specifically radiation pressure, battling to push things apart. With each of gravity’s vicious tugs
squeezing photons and matter together, pressure exerts a forceful shove back. And as the two giants struggle,
they heave this fluid back and forth— creating massive waves called
baryonic acoustic oscillations. Moving at almost two thirds
the speed of light these BAOs ripple across space, impacting the universe
on the biggest scale imaginable. These rolling waves determine the
distribution of matter throughout space, meaning that today— almost 14 billion
years after this fight began— we're more likely to find
galaxies at their peaks and empty space in their troughs. And that’s not all. We can still see these ripples in the
background radiation of the universe, a permanent reminder of this epic brawl. But after being locked in a stalemate
for roughly 370,000 years, the tide of our battle finally
begins to turn. After all this time, the heat from the
Big Bang has dissipated significantly, cooling the universe down to a temperature at which loose electrons
start to pair up with protons. Known as the “era of recombination,” this stops electrons
from recklessly pinging around. This allows light to stream freely
for the first time, illuminating the universe. These photons now only exert a tiny force
on the neutral atoms they interact with, gradually reducing the power of pressure. And with that, it’s time to crown
our champion! The undefeated force,
the most pervasive power in the universe: it’s gravity! And yet, this rivalry isn’t over. A similar battle continues between these
two sworn enemies today, within every single star. As gravity pulls a star’s gas inward, pressure increases and pushes
the matter back outward. This push and pull keeps the Sun,
and all other stars, stable for billions of years. In fact, this clash of the titans
is the same reason Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t collapse
to the ground. So while their greatest fight
might have ended, these two warriors are still
to be locked in combat— even as a new challenger approaches.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the coupling of baryonic matter and radiation before the recombination, and the correct option explains that it is due to the interaction between electrons and photons.

Question 4 does not directly ask about the coupling of baryonic matter and radiation, but it does ask about radiation pressure and its effect on the universe. Option B of Question 4 mentions that radiation pressure is the force exerted by photons on matter, and it pushes matter apart. This is related to the interaction between electrons and photons mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Although not a perfect match, Question 4 is the closest generated MCQ that addresses a similar concept.

components into our infant universe. Dark matter, which only interacts
with gravity. Baryonic matter, which makes
up all matter you’ve ever seen, is affected by both gravity and pressure. And radiation composed 
of innumerable particles of light, also known as photons. In the moments just after the Big Bang, all three components are in equilibrium, meaning no one location
is denser than another. But as the universe starts expanding,
differences in density start to emerge. Gravity immediately gets to work
pulling matter together. Dark matter begins to collect
at the center of these increasingly
dense regions, forming the foundations
of future galaxies. Meanwhile, pressure begins gathering
its strength. In this hot, high-energy environment, protons and electrons can’t come
together to form atoms, so these loose particles zip around,
freely interacting with ambient photons. The result is almost a fluid
of baryonic matter and radiation. But the closer these baryonic particles
get, the hotter the fluid becomes, pushing photons to ping
around with incredible force. This is the power of pressure,
specifically radiation pressure, battling to push things apart. With each of gravity’s vicious tugs
squeezing photons and matter together, pressure exerts a forceful shove back. And as the two giants struggle,
they heave this fluid back and forth— creating massive waves called
baryonic acoustic oscillations. Moving at almost two thirds
the speed of light these BAOs ripple across space, impacting the universe
on the biggest scale imaginable. These rolling waves determine the
distribution of matter throughout space, meaning that today— almost 14 billion
years after this fight began— we're more likely to find
galaxies at their peaks and empty space in their troughs. And that’s not all. We can still see these ripples in the
background radiation of the universe, a permanent reminder of this epic brawl. But after being locked in a stalemate
for roughly 370,000 years, the tide of our battle finally
begins to turn. After all this time, the heat from the
Big Bang has dissipated significantly, cooling the universe down to a temperature at which loose electrons
start to pair up with protons. Known as the “era of recombination,” this stops electrons
from recklessly pinging around. This allows light to stream freely
for the first time, illuminating the universe. These photons now only exert a tiny force
on the neutral atoms they interact with, gradually reducing the power of pressure. And with that, it’s time to crown
our champion! The undefeated force,
the most pervasive power in the universe: it’s gravity! And yet, this rivalry isn’t over. A similar battle continues between these
two sworn enemies today, within every single star. As gravity pulls a star’s gas inward, pressure increases and pushes
the matter back outward. This push and pull keeps the Sun,
and all other stars, stable for billions of years. In fact, this clash of the titans
is the same reason Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t collapse
to the ground. So while their greatest fight
might have ended, these two warriors are still
to be locked in combat— even as a new challenger approaches.

Welcome one and all! It’s time to grab your seat
for the biggest battle in the soon-to-be-formed universe. That’s right— 
the Big Bang is about to go down! In one corner is the force that brings
all matter together. It acts on any particle with mass,
and its range is infinite— give it up for gravity! In the other corner, our contender can
push matter away with spectacular strength. When the going gets tough,
this fighter just gets tougher. That’s right, it’s pressure! Over the next several

**Transcript**:
For 100 days in 1994,
the African country of Rwanda suffered a horrific campaign
of mass murder. Neighbor turned against neighbor
as violence engulfed the region, resulting in the deaths of over one-tenth
of the country’s population. The seeds of this conflict were
planted a century earlier, first when German, and later Belgian,
colonizers arrived in the country. At the time, Rwanda was ruled
by a monarchy of Tutsi, one of the three ethnic groups
comprising the population. Tutsi and the even smaller Twa communities
were minority groups, while Hutu composed the majority. Many Hutus and Tutsi civilians
were on good terms, but colonial powers encouraged
political division. Belgians enforced record keeping
around ethnic identity, and created a public narrative that cast
Tutsi as elite rulers and Hutu as ordinary farmers. Over time, this propaganda led 
to intense political hostility. And while colonial powers had
largely withdrawn by 1959, lingering anger motivated a Hutu revolt, forcing many Tutsi leaders
to flee the country. Over the following decade, Rwanda transitioned to an independent
republic with a Hutu government. This new administration argued
that as the majority group, Hutu deserved exclusive access
to political power. They excluded the Tutsi minority 
by appointing offices based on population and prohibited the return of Tutsi
families that had fled years earlier. Hutu extremists also circulated propaganda blaming Tutsi for the country’s economic,
social, and political problems. Discontent with their life in exile, a small group of Tutsi insurgents
invaded Rwanda in 1990, beginning a violent civil war. The conflict lasted three years before it
was resolved with a formal peace accord. But the war’s aftermath was
rife with insecurity. While some civilians in both groups
remained amicable, the treaty intensified
political polarization. And in 1994, when a plane carrying
the Hutu Rwandan president was shot down, the conflict broke out anew. This time, Hutu officials had prepared
a deadly response to ensure they stayed in power. Working off a list of targets, government-funded Hutu militias
flooded the streets, perpetrating acts of physical
and sexual violence against Tutsi political enemies
and civilians. Over the chaotic following months, over 1 million Hutu civilians joined
their ranks due to coercion, self-preservation, or the pursuit
of personal agendas. Tutsi victims sought refuge
at churches and schools where they hoped international
organizations would protect them, but no outside party came to their aid. UN soldiers who’d overseen
the Peace Accord were instructed to abandon
Tutsi civilians, and UN leadership refused to acknowledge
the genocide taking place. The violence didn’t end until mid-July, when the Tutsi army—
who instigated the previous civil war— seized control of the country. By the time the fighting was over, roughly 800,000 Rwandans had been killed, and only a small fraction of the
Tutsi population was left alive. In the months that followed, there was no easy strategy for bringing
the killers to justice. The UN established a special tribunal
in Tanzania to try the key perpetrators. But Hutu civilians from every level
of society had committed atrocities against their neighbors, friends,
and even family members. There were roughly 120,000 Rwandans
awaiting trial, and inmates were dying from overcrowding
and poor hygiene. The new Rwandan government estimated 
it would take 100 years to prosecute every accused civilian in national court. So officials determined 
the best path forward involved looking to the country’s past. Rwanda has a traditional process for resolving interpersonal conflicts
called gacaca. Roughly translating
to “justice on the grass,” gacaca had long been used to address
offenses within villages. Local witnesses would offer testimony and could then speak for
or against the accused. Then, appointed lay judges would determine
an appropriate penalty within the community’s means. In the hope of trying perpetrators
more quickly, the government adapted gacaca
for their formal courts. These hybrid trials had 
no professional attorneys or judges, and no evidence outside the spoken word and a case file detailing the crimes
of the accused. All charges were then divided
into four categories: masterminding the genocide
and committing acts of sexual violence, participating in the killings,
physical assault, or destroying Tutsi property. Those found guilty
of the first two categories were entered into the
traditional court system, but the other crimes were
assigned set penalties which could be reduced
if the accused pled guilty. Beginning in 2002, thousands of gacaca
courts convened every week. The process proved faster 
than conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials
was mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse
their neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were
intimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that
not all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases
with Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred
during the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted
1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts 
helped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials
were a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate
to leave behind.

**Transcript**:
For 100 days in 1994,
the African country of Rwanda suffered a horrific campaign
of mass murder. Neighbor turned against neighbor
as violence engulfed the region, resulting in the deaths of over one-tenth
of the country’s population. The seeds of this conflict were
planted a century earlier, first when German, and later Belgian,
colonizers arrived in the country. At the time, Rwanda was ruled
by a monarchy of Tutsi, one of the three ethnic groups
comprising the population. Tutsi and the even smaller Twa communities
were minority groups, while Hutu composed the majority. Many Hutus and Tutsi civilians
were on good terms, but colonial powers encouraged
political division. Belgians enforced record keeping
around ethnic identity, and created a public narrative that cast
Tutsi as elite rulers and Hutu as ordinary farmers. Over time, this propaganda led 
to intense political hostility. And while colonial powers had
largely withdrawn by 1959, lingering anger motivated a Hutu revolt, forcing many Tutsi leaders
to flee the country. Over the following decade, Rwanda transitioned to an independent
republic with a Hutu government. This new administration argued
that as the majority group, Hutu deserved exclusive access
to political power. They excluded the Tutsi minority 
by appointing offices based on population and prohibited the return of Tutsi
families that had fled years earlier. Hutu extremists also circulated propaganda blaming Tutsi for the country’s economic,
social, and political problems. Discontent with their life in exile, a small group of Tutsi insurgents
invaded Rwanda in 1990, beginning a violent civil war. The conflict lasted three years before it
was resolved with a formal peace accord. But the war’s aftermath was
rife with insecurity. While some civilians in both groups
remained amicable, the treaty intensified
political polarization. And in 1994, when a plane carrying
the Hutu Rwandan president was shot down, the conflict broke out anew. This time, Hutu officials had prepared
a deadly response to ensure they stayed in power. Working off a list of targets, government-funded Hutu militias
flooded the streets, perpetrating acts of physical
and sexual violence against Tutsi political enemies
and civilians. Over the chaotic following months, over 1 million Hutu civilians joined
their ranks due to coercion, self-preservation, or the pursuit
of personal agendas. Tutsi victims sought refuge
at churches and schools where they hoped international
organizations would protect them, but no outside party came to their aid. UN soldiers who’d overseen
the Peace Accord were instructed to abandon
Tutsi civilians, and UN leadership refused to acknowledge
the genocide taking place. The violence didn’t end until mid-July, when the Tutsi army—
who instigated the previous civil war— seized control of the country. By the time the fighting was over, roughly 800,000 Rwandans had been killed, and only a small fraction of the
Tutsi population was left alive. In the months that followed, there was no easy strategy for bringing
the killers to justice. The UN established a special tribunal
in Tanzania to try the key perpetrators. But Hutu civilians from every level
of society had committed atrocities against their neighbors, friends,
and even family members. There were roughly 120,000 Rwandans
awaiting trial, and inmates were dying from overcrowding
and poor hygiene. The new Rwandan government estimated 
it would take 100 years to prosecute every accused civilian in national court. So officials determined 
the best path forward involved looking to the country’s past. Rwanda has a traditional process for resolving interpersonal conflicts
called gacaca. Roughly translating
to “justice on the grass,” gacaca had long been used to address
offenses within villages. Local witnesses would offer testimony and could then speak for
or against the accused. Then, appointed lay judges would determine
an appropriate penalty within the community’s means. In the hope of trying perpetrators
more quickly, the government adapted gacaca
for their formal courts. These hybrid trials had 
no professional attorneys or judges, and no evidence outside the spoken word and a case file detailing the crimes
of the accused. All charges were then divided
into four categories: masterminding the genocide
and committing acts of sexual violence, participating in the killings,
physical assault, or destroying Tutsi property. Those found guilty
of the first two categories were entered into the
traditional court system, but the other crimes were
assigned set penalties which could be reduced
if the accused pled guilty. Beginning in 2002, thousands of gacaca
courts convened every week. The process proved faster 
than conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials
was mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse
their neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were
intimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that
not all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases
with Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred
during the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted
1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts 
helped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials
were a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate
to leave behind.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar.

Although Question 4 does not directly ask about the government in power at the time of the genocide, it does mention the 1990 invasion by the Tutsi insurgents and the subsequent signing of a formal peace accord. This event is closely related to the lead-up to the genocide and the Hutu government's role in it.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the government in power during the genocide.

If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly available in the provided options.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around
Bell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell
that could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated
as the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization
would soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,
as this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million
to buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form
of energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives
like coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped
with rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves
in their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s
price history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,
where in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced 
the Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision
for the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally
invest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners
for the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was
highly subsidized, at times reaching four times
the market price. Several other countries soon
followed Germany’s example, implementing similar
policies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand
for solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were
able to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,
while efficiency grew. Today, a 46-square-meter rooftop
solar unit is often efficient enough to fully power a home, and this residential unit
no longer costs millions— in the US in 2022,  the average
consumer cost of a rooftop solar unit ranged from around $17,000 to $23,000. These prices dropped by over 60%
between 2010 and 2020 alone. So how much money can you save
by switching to solar? US solar equipped homeowners
can save around $1,500 per year on their energy bills, equating to a net savings of $10,000
to $30,000 during the unit’s lifetime. Month-to-month savings
tend to vary, based on the amount of direct sunlight 
your panel receives, weather conditions, and the price
of electricity where you live. But not everyone can get solar. Adopting solar can be difficult
for renters, and in many countries, more than 25% of adults don’t own
their own homes. Even if you do, your roof must meet
certain orientation and tilt requirements to make solar a worthwhile investment. And while units often pay for themselves
through offset energy costs, the initial purchase and installation
price for solar can be expensive. But several companies have adopted
solar leasing models, where they finance the material costs, installation, and upkeep
of the rooftop systems. Homeowners can then buy the panel’s
generated electricity at a fixed rate that’s generally lower
than the local utility’s price. Still, many are working
towards community-based solutions, which would enable entire neighborhoods
to profit from solar use. Europe is home to more than 7,000
community energy associations, where local members collectively
invest in wind turbines and solar panels to power their local grid. In 2005, the German town of Wolfhagen
created an 800 member citizens co-op, which communally invested $2.84 million to buy up 25% of the local energy company and expand its renewables program. Today, its turbines and panels
generate enough energy to meet the town’s needs and then some. Surplus energy is sold
to neighboring towns, and profits are reinvested
back into the community. For many, the appeal of solar
goes beyond just savings. Homes equipped with it are
more climate resilient, because they can be protected
from utility grid outages and brownouts. Not to mention solar’s key role
in decarbonizing the energy grid. By working together with larger-scale
wind and solar farms, rooftop solar units help reduce
our reliance on fossil fuels, paving the way for a cleaner
and more reliable energy future.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around
Bell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell
that could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated
as the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization
would soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,
as this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million
to buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form
of energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives
like coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped
with rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves
in their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s
price history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,
where in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced 
the Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision
for the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally
invest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners
for the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was
highly subsidized, at times reaching four times
the market price. Several other countries soon
followed Germany’s example, implementing similar
policies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand
for solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were
able to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of its relevance to the topic and the information it conveys.

The ground truth MCQ states that "In many countries, solar energy is the cheapest form of electricity. Cheaper, even, than fossil fuel generated electricity." This information is mentioned in the transcript as "But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form of energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives like coal and natural gas."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 4 comes closest to conveying a similar idea, although it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ. Question 4 states that "What was the result of the increased demand for solar panels worldwide due to government incentives and policies?" and one of its options is "C. Solar panel prices dropped, while efficiency grew." This option indirectly implies that solar energy has become more affordable and efficient, which is related to the idea that solar energy is the cheapest form of electricity in many countries.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I must emphasize that the similarity is limited.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around
Bell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell
that could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated
as the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization
would soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,
as this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million
to buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form
of energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives
like coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped
with rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves
in their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s
price history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,
where in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced 
the Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision
for the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally
invest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners
for the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was
highly subsidized, at times reaching four times
the market price. Several other countries soon
followed Germany’s example, implementing similar
policies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand
for solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were
able to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,
while efficiency grew. Today, a 46-square-meter rooftop
solar unit is often efficient enough to fully power a home, and this residential unit
no longer costs millions— in the US in 2022,  the average
consumer cost of a rooftop solar unit ranged from around $17,000 to $23,000. These prices dropped by over 60%
between 2010 and 2020 alone. So how much money can you save
by switching to solar? US solar equipped homeowners
can save around $1,500 per year on their energy bills, equating to a net savings of $10,000
to $30,000 during the unit’s lifetime. Month-to-month savings
tend to vary, based on the amount of direct sunlight 
your panel receives, weather conditions, and the price
of electricity where you live. But not everyone can get solar. Adopting solar can be difficult
for renters, and in many countries, more than 25% of adults don’t own
their own homes. Even if you do, your roof must meet
certain orientation and tilt requirements to make solar a worthwhile investment. And while units often pay for themselves
through offset energy costs, the initial purchase and installation
price for solar can be expensive. But several companies have adopted
solar leasing models, where they finance the material costs, installation, and upkeep
of the rooftop systems. Homeowners can then buy the panel’s
generated electricity at a fixed rate that’s generally lower
than the local utility’s price. Still, many are working
towards community-based solutions, which would enable entire neighborhoods
to profit from solar use. Europe is home to more than 7,000
community energy associations, where local members collectively
invest in wind turbines and solar panels to power their local grid. In 2005, the German town of Wolfhagen
created an 800 member citizens co-op, which communally invested $2.84 million to buy up 25% of the local energy company and expand its renewables program. Today, its turbines and panels
generate enough energy to meet the town’s needs and then some. Surplus energy is sold
to neighboring towns, and profits are reinvested
back into the community. For many, the appeal of solar
goes beyond just savings. Homes equipped with it are
more climate resilient, because they can be protected
from utility grid outages and brownouts. Not to mention solar’s key role
in decarbonizing the energy grid. By working together with larger-scale
wind and solar farms, rooftop solar units help reduce
our reliance on fossil fuels, paving the way for a cleaner
and more reliable energy future.

Welcome to another event
in the Myth Olympics— the eternal arena in which 
creatures and deities from global mythologies
compete for glory. I’m Shamash, the Mesopotamian
god of judgment, and today we’re gathered to witness 
this year’s clash of stunning speed. Keeping track of our racers with me
is last year’s champion, Hermes— the swift-footed messenger
of the Greek gods. Oh, I'm delighted to hang up my
winged sandals today, Shamash. But I am keeping my helmet on because
we are in for a wild ride! It’s true! Almost every mythical tradition
claims one creature as the fastest of them all. From goddesses who run like the wind
to creatures who outstrip every captor, mortals of all cultures are fascinated
by superhuman swiftness. So, Hermes, who are 
this year’s contestants? Well, the Norse gods have sent Sleipnir— son of Loki and the greatest
of Asgard’s steeds. He’s usually spotted gallivanting
between the realms with Odin. But today, Sleipnir is riding solo. Also competing is Raiju, the Japanese
beast of thunder and lightning. When the weather’s nice, they like
to nap in mortals’ belly buttons. But when clouds darken, Raiju leaps
into action alongside Raijin, the Shinto god of storms. With this fearsome competitor,
lightning can strike at any time. But storms don’t scare Idaten. This Buddhist deity has a record
of outrunning the weather— his name is even part of the Japanese
expression for “run like the wind.” Idaten’s definitely got some tricks
up those steel sleeves. Perhaps, but our last competitor
has tricks of his own. Savitar is the Hindu deity
that sets everything in motion, from moving the Sun
to chasing away sorrow and sickness. Yes, today’s roster contains many
mythic interpretations of speed. From personifications 
of the unpredictable elements to creatures capable of outrunning
reality itself. But perhaps the myth of speed
is really about the elusive nature of all supernatural beings. Those are some, uh, neat ideas, Shamash—
but this race is the real deal! Our noble competitors will run
the equivalent of 100 marathons through a hazardous
natural obstacle course. And our racers are taking 
their first steps right now! Idaten takes the lead, but don’t let
that calm exterior fool you— his determination is legendary. When a literal speed demon stole
one of Buddha's teeth, he raced over mountains and rivers
to capture the culprit. Don’t forget Sleipnir— 
he’s cleared hurdles in his time, too. I’ll say! On his mission to retrieve
Baldur the Bright from the fortress of Hel,
he rode for nine days straight— clearing the gates of the underworld
without breaking a sweat. They don’t call him
the sliding one for nothing— he appears to slide on the wind itself! Of course, wind is often personified
as a sacred being that— No time for a history lesson!
That wind is picking up! Like the force of nature they are, Raiju
brews a storm to scorch the competition. It’s certainly possible. Raiju is known
for their destructive storms. But they’re also our most chaotic racer, frequently crashing to earth and 
getting tangled in flimsy mortal nets. They’re unpredictable! Chaos is often associated
with mythology’s fastest creatures, from the shapeshifting Flemish Kludde
who preys on travelers to the smelly Japanese spirit Nuppeppō
who moves too fast to be caught. True, but there are also steady agents
of speed. Here comes one now! Lending his boundless energy to the Sun,
Savitar breaks through Raiju’s storm! This golden-handed protector of the
universe can manipulate the elements— and all moving things for that matter! A valiant effort to redirect the wind
by Idaten... but not valiant enough. The path seems clear for Savitar. But is that the gallop of hooves I hear? What beautiful blindside! It’s Sleipnir hurtling 
out of another dimension! it seems the shamanic steed shares Odin’s
ability to travel between the realms. This racer might not have to play
by Savitar’s rules. But... wait a second,
am I watching this in slow motion? No! It appears the god of motion is
slowing the speed of his opponent, suspending him centimeters
from the course’s conclusion. Sleipnir’s stampede slows
to a snail’s pace as Savitar leisurely glides
over the finish line! What a finale! Savitar’s mastery of motion
immobilized his fastest foe! It seems Sleipnir’s not too happy
with this controversial result, but hey, there’s always next year. And one might say that we’re all winners
for witnessing the mind-bending speed of so many myths and legends.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Question 7 asks about the competitor that is known for being unpredictable and frequently crashing to earth, which is related to the idea of Raiju being brought to a halt during a storm. However, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about what happens to Raiju during a storm, with options that include getting tangled in nets or being halted by some other means. Since this is not present among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the closest match.

Although the question and options are not identical, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions relate to Savitar's powers and characteristics, and the generated MCQ provides information about Savitar's role as the Hindu deity of motion.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the general context of the transcript, whereas the ground truth MCQ is more specific about Savitar's powers.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Index: 5**

Please keep in mind that this is an approximation, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that are more specific to the ground truth MCQ's content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to another event
in the Myth Olympics— the eternal arena in which 
creatures and deities from global mythologies
compete for glory. I’m Shamash, the Mesopotamian
god of judgment, and today we’re gathered to witness 
this year’s clash of stunning speed. Keeping track of our racers with me
is last year’s champion, Hermes— the swift-footed messenger
of the Greek gods. Oh, I'm delighted to hang up my
winged sandals today, Shamash. But I am keeping my helmet on because
we are in for a wild ride! It’s true! Almost every mythical tradition
claims one creature as the fastest of them all. From goddesses who run like the wind
to creatures who outstrip every captor, mortals of all cultures are fascinated
by superhuman swiftness. So, Hermes, who are 
this year’s contestants? Well, the Norse gods have sent Sleipnir— son of Loki and the greatest
of Asgard’s steeds. He’s usually spotted gallivanting
between the realms with Odin. But today, Sleipnir is riding solo. Also competing is Raiju, the Japanese
beast of thunder and lightning. When the weather’s nice, they like
to nap in mortals’ belly buttons. But when clouds darken, Raiju leaps
into action alongside Raijin, the Shinto god of storms. With this fearsome competitor,
lightning can strike at any time. But storms don’t scare Idaten. This Buddhist deity has a record
of outrunning the weather— his name is even part of the Japanese
expression for “run like the wind.” Idaten’s definitely got some tricks
up those steel sleeves. Perhaps, but our last competitor
has tricks of his own. Savitar is the Hindu deity
that sets everything in motion, from moving the Sun
to chasing away sorrow and sickness. Yes, today’s roster contains many
mythic interpretations of speed. From personifications 
of the unpredictable elements to creatures capable of outrunning
reality itself. But perhaps the myth of speed
is really about the elusive nature of all supernatural beings. Those are some, uh, neat ideas, Shamash—
but this race is the real deal! Our noble competitors will run
the equivalent of 100 marathons through a hazardous
natural obstacle course. And our racers are taking 
their first steps right now! Idaten takes the lead, but don’t let
that calm exterior fool you— his determination is legendary. When a literal speed demon stole
one of Buddha's teeth, he raced over mountains and rivers
to capture the culprit. Don’t forget Sleipnir— 
he’s cleared hurdles in his time, too. I’ll say! On his mission to retrieve
Baldur the Bright from the fortress of Hel,
he rode for nine days straight— clearing the gates of the underworld
without breaking a sweat. They don’t call him
the sliding one for nothing— he appears to slide on the wind itself! Of course, wind is often personified
as a sacred being that— No time for a history lesson!
That wind is picking up! Like the force of nature they are, Raiju
brews a storm to scorch the competition. It’s certainly possible. Raiju is known
for their destructive storms. But they’re also our most chaotic racer, frequently crashing to earth and 
getting tangled in flimsy mortal nets. They’re unpredictable! Chaos is often associated
with mythology’s fastest creatures, from the shapeshifting Flemish Kludde
who preys on travelers to the smelly Japanese spirit Nuppeppō
who moves too fast to be caught. True, but there are also steady agents
of speed. Here comes one now! Lending his boundless energy to the Sun,
Savitar breaks through Raiju’s storm! This golden-handed protector of the
universe can manipulate the elements— and all moving things for that matter! A valiant effort to redirect the wind
by Idaten... but not valiant enough. The path seems clear for Savitar. But is that the gallop of hooves I hear? What beautiful blindside! It’s Sleipnir hurtling 
out of another dimension! it seems the shamanic steed shares Odin’s
ability to travel between the realms. This racer might not have to play
by Savitar’s rules. But... wait a second,
am I watching this in slow motion? No! It appears the god of motion is
slowing the speed of his opponent, suspending him centimeters
from the course’s conclusion. Sleipnir’s stampede slows
to a snail’s pace as Savitar leisurely glides
over the finish line! What a finale! Savitar’s mastery of motion
immobilized his fastest foe! It seems Sleipnir’s not too happy
with this controversial result, but hey, there’s always next year. And one might say that we’re all winners
for witnessing the mind-bending speed of so many myths and legends.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: Which deity has a record of outrunning the weather and is competing in the Myth Olympics? Options: A. Idaten, B. Savitar, C. Raiju, D. Sleipnir**

Although the question is not an exact match, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about Idaten's feat of outrunning a speed demon to retrieve the Buddha's teeth, while the generated MCQ mentions Idaten's record of outrunning the weather. Both questions are related to Idaten's speed and agility.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs seem to focus more on the general information about the Myth Olympics and the competitors, whereas the ground truth MCQ is more specific about Idaten's actions.

If I had to choose an index, I would say:

**Index: 4**

Please keep in mind that this is not a perfect match, and the generated MCQs could be improved to better align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine opening a bag of chips only
to find Santa Claus looking back at you. Or turning the corner to see
a smile as wide as a building. Humans see faces in all kinds
of mundane objects, but these faces aren’t real— they’re illusions due to a phenomenon
known as face pareidolia. So why exactly does this happen, and how
far can this distortion of reality go? Humans are social animals, and reading faces is an important part
of our ability to understand each other. Even a glimpse of someone's face can help
you determine if you've met them before, what mood they’re in,
and if they’re paying attention to you. We even use facial features
to make snap-judgments about a person’s potential trustworthiness
or aggression. To capture all this vital information, humans have evolved to be very sensitive
to face-like structures. Whenever we see something, our brain immediately starts working
to identify the new visual stimuli based on our expectations
and prior knowledge. And since faces are so important, humans have evolved several regions
of the brain that enable us to identify them
faster than other visual stimuli. Whereas recognizing most objects takes
our brain around a quarter of a second, we can detect a face
in just a tenth of a second. It makes sense that we'd prioritize
identifying faces over everything else. But brain imaging studies 
have revealed that regions may actually be too sensitive, leading them to find faces
where they don’t exist. In one study, participants reported
seeing illusory faces in over 35% of pure-noise images
shown to them, despite the fact that nothing was there. It might seem concerning that our brains
can be so wrong so often, but these illusory faces
might actually be a byproduct of something evolutionarily advantageous. Since processing all the visual input
we encounter quickly and correctly is an enormous computational
effort for the brain, this kind of hypersensitivity might
act as a useful shortcut. After all, seeing illusory faces
is usually harmless, while missing a real face can
lead to serious issues. But for hypersensitivity to be
more helpful than harmful, our brains also need to be quick 
at determining when a face is real and when it isn’t. So how fast can our brains tell
when they’ve been duped? To answer this question,
researchers used a form of brain imaging known as magnetoencephalography. By measuring the magnetic fields caused
by electric currents in the brain, this technique allows us to track
changes in brain activity at the scale of milliseconds. With this tool, researchers revealed
that the brain generally recognizes a face as illusory
within a quarter of a second— around the same time that we can identify
most non-face visual stimuli. However, even after our brain
knows the face is fake, we can still see it in the object. And by messing with these brain areas, we can further impact our ability to
differentiate between fact from fiction. In one study, researchers stimulated
a participant’s fusiform face area while they were looking 
at a non-face object. As a result, the participant reported
momentarily seeing facial features despite the object remaining unchanged. And while looking at a real face,
stimulation of this same area created perceived distortions
of the eyes and nose. These studies suggest that certain
features are crucial to face detection. Just three dots can be enough
to represent eyes and a mouth. People will even assign gender, age,
and emotion to illusory faces. It’s unclear whether a person’s culture
or individual history impacts these perceptions, but we do know that pareidolia isn’t
unique to the human experience. Rhesus macaque monkeys show eye movements
similar to our own when observing pareidolia-inducing objects
and real faces, suggesting that this phenomenon is baked
deep into our social primate brains. So, next time you see an unexpected
face in a coffee, car, or cabinet, remember that it’s just your brain
working overtime not to miss the faces that really matter.

But if we consider the closest match based on the context of time and face recognition, it would be Question 3, but with a different intent.

A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the time it takes to recognize an illusory face. Since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the closest match based on the context:

Index: 3 (with a note that the intent is not an exact match)

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the time it takes to recognize an illusory face.

Let's re-evaluate the generated MCQs and consider the question content, options, and overall intent. Upon re-evaluation, I noticed that Question 6 discusses how the brain determines when a face is real or illusory, which is related to the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not ask about the time it takes to recognize an illusory face.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the context and intent, I would suggest:

Index: 6 (with a note that the intent is not an exact match)

Again, I want to emphasize that the generated MCQs do not have an exact match for the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the time it takes to recognize an illusory face.

**Transcript**:
Imagine opening a bag of chips only
to find Santa Claus looking back at you. Or turning the corner to see
a smile as wide as a building. Humans see faces in all kinds
of mundane objects, but these faces aren’t real— they’re illusions due to a phenomenon
known as face pareidolia. So why exactly does this happen, and how
far can this distortion of reality go? Humans are social animals, and reading faces is an important part
of our ability to understand each other. Even a glimpse of someone's face can help
you determine if you've met them before, what mood they’re in,
and if they’re paying attention to you. We even use facial features
to make snap-judgments about a person’s potential trustworthiness
or aggression. To capture all this vital information, humans have evolved to be very sensitive
to face-like structures. Whenever we see something, our brain immediately starts working
to identify the new visual stimuli based on our expectations
and prior knowledge. And since faces are so important, humans have evolved several regions
of the brain that enable us to identify them
faster than other visual stimuli. Whereas recognizing most objects takes
our brain around a quarter of a second, we can detect a face
in just a tenth of a second. It makes sense that we'd prioritize
identifying faces over everything else. But brain imaging studies 
have revealed that regions may actually be too sensitive, leading them to find faces
where they don’t exist. In one study, participants reported
seeing illusory faces in over 35% of pure-noise images
shown to them, despite the fact that nothing was there. It might seem concerning that our brains
can be so wrong so often, but these illusory faces
might actually be a byproduct of something evolutionarily advantageous. Since processing all the visual input
we encounter quickly and correctly is an enormous computational
effort for the brain, this kind of hypersensitivity might
act as a useful shortcut. After all, seeing illusory faces
is usually harmless, while missing a real face can
lead to serious issues. But for hypersensitivity to be
more helpful than harmful, our brains also need to be quick 
at determining when a face is real and when it isn’t. So how fast can our brains tell
when they’ve been duped? To answer this question,
researchers used a form of brain imaging known as magnetoencephalography. By measuring the magnetic fields caused
by electric currents in the brain, this technique allows us to track
changes in brain activity at the scale of milliseconds. With this tool, researchers revealed
that the brain generally recognizes a face as illusory
within a quarter of a second— around the same time that we can identify
most non-face visual stimuli. However, even after our brain
knows the face is fake, we can still see it in the object. And by messing with these brain areas, we can further impact our ability to
differentiate between fact from fiction. In one study, researchers stimulated
a participant’s fusiform face area while they were looking 
at a non-face object. As a result, the participant reported
momentarily seeing facial features despite the object remaining unchanged. And while looking at a real face,
stimulation of this same area created perceived distortions
of the eyes and nose. These studies suggest that certain
features are crucial to face detection. Just three dots can be enough
to represent eyes and a mouth. People will even assign gender, age,
and emotion to illusory faces. It’s unclear whether a person’s culture
or individual history impacts these perceptions, but we do know that pareidolia isn’t
unique to the human experience. Rhesus macaque monkeys show eye movements
similar to our own when observing pareidolia-inducing objects
and real faces, suggesting that this phenomenon is baked
deep into our social primate brains. So, next time you see an unexpected
face in a coffee, car, or cabinet, remember that it’s just your brain
working overtime not to miss the faces that really matter.

**Transcript**:
With medical students restraining the
patient and onlookers eagerly awaiting, Scottish surgeon Robert Liston 
poised himself to begin. In quick succession, 
he cut his patient’s flesh, sawed through their tibia and fibula
and, within just a few minutes, the amputation was complete. It was the 1830s and Liston was renowned
for his surgical speed. This was important because, 
before anesthesia was widely used, patients had to consciously endure
every moment of surgery. The quest for anesthetics
that could induce unconsciousness and enable more meticulous surgeries
launched long before Liston. Around 200 CE, Chinese physician Hua Tuo
described mixing alcohol with a powder of various ingredients
to anesthetize patients. And 13th century Arab surgeon Ibn al-Quff
described patients taking anesthetics, likely inhaling drugs like cannabis, 
opium, and mandrake, from saturated sponges. By the end of the 1700s, 
many scientists were pondering chemistry’s medical applications. This led to a profusion of anesthetic
advancements involving three main players: nitrous oxide, ether, and chloroform. In 1799, English chemist Humphry Davy
began experimenting with nitrous oxide, or laughing gas— inhaling it himself
and observing its effects on friends. Davy noted that its pain-relieving
abilities might make it useful for surgical operations— but it would be decades 
before that happened. This was, at least in part,
because some surgeons and patients were skeptical of the effectiveness 
and safety of anesthetic drugs. In 1804, Japanese surgeon Seishū Hanaoka
successfully removed a breast tumor from a patient anesthetized
with a mix of medicinal herbs. But the news stayed in Japan indefinitely. Eventually, ether started garnering
medical attention. It was first formulated centuries before
then came to be used recreationally. During the so-called “ether frolics”
of the early 1800s, an American physician noted 
that the fall he suffered while using ether was painless. In 1842, he etherized a patient 
and successfully removed a tumor from his neck. In the meantime, dentists finally began
recognizing nitrous oxide’s promise. But, in 1845, when an American dentist
attempted a public tooth extraction on someone anesthetized
with nitrous oxide, he apparently encountered a setback
when his patient screamed. It was probably just an insufficient dose— but it was a bad publicity
moment for the drug. Meanwhile, dentists refined ether
for tooth extractions. And, in October 1846, an American dentist
administered ether to a patient, and a surgeon removed
the man’s neck tumor. Two months later, Liston himself performed
an upper leg amputation on an etherized patient, who reportedly regained consciousness
minutes after and asked when the procedure would begin. Further ether-enabled successes followed
from India, Russia, and beyond. But ether had issues, 
including unpleasant side effects. Scottish obstetrician James Simpson
heard about an alternative anesthetic called chloroform. And, in 1847, he and two colleagues
decided to try some themselves and promptly passed out. Soon after, Simpson
administered chloroform to one of his patients during childbirth. It quickly gained popularity
because it was fast-acting and thought to be side-effect-free— though we now know it’s harmful
and probably carcinogenic. Because anesthetics weren’t
yet fully understood, they sometimes had lethal consequences. And some doctors held sexist
and racist beliefs that dictated the amount of anesthesia they’d provide,
if any at all. American obstetrician Charles Meigs argued
that the pain of childbirth was a form of divine suffering and was skeptical that doctors 
should interfere with it. Throughout the 1840s,
American physician James Marion Sims conducted experimental gynecological
surgeries without pain relief, primarily upon enslaved Black women. By the late 19th century, 
those who could access anesthetics were undergoing increasingly
complex operations, including some that were
previously impossible. Chloroform came to be understood
as a riskier, more toxic option, and fell out of favor by the early 1900s. Alongside newer drugs, ether
and nitrous oxide are still used today— but in modified formulations that are
safer and produce fewer side effects, while doctors closely monitor
the patient’s state. Thanks to these advances, speed is not always of the essence and,
instead of acute agony, surgery can feel like just a dream.

**Transcript**:
With medical students restraining the
patient and onlookers eagerly awaiting, Scottish surgeon Robert Liston 
poised himself to begin. In quick succession, 
he cut his patient’s flesh, sawed through their tibia and fibula
and, within just a few minutes, the amputation was complete. It was the 1830s and Liston was renowned
for his surgical speed. This was important because, 
before anesthesia was widely used, patients had to consciously endure
every moment of surgery. The quest for anesthetics
that could induce unconsciousness and enable more meticulous surgeries
launched long before Liston. Around 200 CE, Chinese physician Hua Tuo
described mixing alcohol with a powder of various ingredients
to anesthetize patients. And 13th century Arab surgeon Ibn al-Quff
described patients taking anesthetics, likely inhaling drugs like cannabis, 
opium, and mandrake, from saturated sponges. By the end of the 1700s, 
many scientists were pondering chemistry’s medical applications. This led to a profusion of anesthetic
advancements involving three main players: nitrous oxide, ether, and chloroform. In 1799, English chemist Humphry Davy
began experimenting with nitrous oxide, or laughing gas— inhaling it himself
and observing its effects on friends. Davy noted that its pain-relieving
abilities might make it useful for surgical operations— but it would be decades 
before that happened. This was, at least in part,
because some surgeons and patients were skeptical of the effectiveness 
and safety of anesthetic drugs. In 1804, Japanese surgeon Seishū Hanaoka
successfully removed a breast tumor from a patient anesthetized
with a mix of medicinal herbs. But the news stayed in Japan indefinitely. Eventually, ether started garnering
medical attention. It was first formulated centuries before
then came to be used recreationally. During the so-called “ether frolics”
of the early 1800s, an American physician noted 
that the fall he suffered while using ether was painless. In 1842, he etherized a patient 
and successfully removed a tumor from his neck. In the meantime, dentists finally began
recognizing nitrous oxide’s promise. But, in 1845, when an American dentist
attempted a public tooth extraction on someone anesthetized
with nitrous oxide, he apparently encountered a setback
when his patient screamed. It was probably just an insufficient dose— but it was a bad publicity
moment for the drug. Meanwhile, dentists refined ether
for tooth extractions. And, in October 1846, an American dentist
administered ether to a patient, and a surgeon removed
the man’s neck tumor. Two months later, Liston himself performed
an upper leg amputation on an etherized patient, who reportedly regained consciousness
minutes after and asked when the procedure would begin. Further ether-enabled successes followed
from India, Russia, and beyond. But ether had issues, 
including unpleasant side effects. Scottish obstetrician James Simpson
heard about an alternative anesthetic called chloroform. And, in 1847, he and two colleagues
decided to try some themselves and promptly passed out. Soon after, Simpson
administered chloroform to one of his patients during childbirth. It quickly gained popularity
because it was fast-acting and thought to be side-effect-free— though we now know it’s harmful
and probably carcinogenic. Because anesthetics weren’t
yet fully understood, they sometimes had lethal consequences. And some doctors held sexist
and racist beliefs that dictated the amount of anesthesia they’d provide,
if any at all. American obstetrician Charles Meigs argued
that the pain of childbirth was a form of divine suffering and was skeptical that doctors 
should interfere with it. Throughout the 1840s,
American physician James Marion Sims conducted experimental gynecological
surgeries without pain relief, primarily upon enslaved Black women. By the late 19th century, 
those who could access anesthetics were undergoing increasingly
complex operations, including some that were
previously impossible. Chloroform came to be understood
as a riskier, more toxic option, and fell out of favor by the early 1900s. Alongside newer drugs, ether
and nitrous oxide are still used today— but in modified formulations that are
safer and produce fewer side effects, while doctors closely monitor
the patient’s state. Thanks to these advances, speed is not always of the essence and,
instead of acute agony, surgery can feel like just a dream.

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

Ground Truth MCQ: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to: 
Options: A. Clone themselves, B. Make eggs, C. Feed their offspring, D. Create male mosquitoes

Generated MCQ 8: What is the main signal that mosquitoes follow to find their targets? 
Options: A. Carbon dioxide, B. Lactic acid, C. Acetone, D. Ammonia

Although the questions are not identical, both questions are related to the behavior and biology of mosquitoes. However, a more relevant question would be one that directly addresses why mosquitoes need human blood.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be: 
Question: Why do mosquitoes bite humans?
Options: A. To feed their offspring, B. To make eggs, C. To clone themselves, D. To create male mosquitoes

Unfortunately, this question is not among the generated MCQs. Given the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the biology of mosquitoes, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but still not a direct match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 8 (with the caveat that it's not a direct match)

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 8: What is the main signal that mosquitoes follow to find their targets? Options: A. Carbon dioxide, B. Lactic acid, C. Acetone, D. Ammonia**

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and options are related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about factors that make a person more attractive to mosquitoes, and Question 8 asks about the main signal that mosquitoes follow to find their targets. The correct answer to Question 8 is A. Carbon dioxide, which is mentioned in the transcript as one of the factors that make a person more attractive to mosquitoes (e.g., having a higher metabolism, exercising, or being pregnant, which can increase carbon dioxide production).

However, I must note that there is no generated MCQ that perfectly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Index: 8**

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

Legend has it, hundreds of years ago
a distant ancestor of yours stole a magical tarot deck 
from Fate herself. Today, your family is known the world over
as the world’s greatest fortune tellers. While the deck has increased 
your fortunes many times over, it came with a terrible cost. Once every 23 years, 
a door appears in your house. One member of your family must enter, and face Fate in a duel with arcane rules
only known to your opponent. And every time, 
generation after generation, the outcome is the same: Fate claims their soul. 23 years ago, your father accepted 
the challenge and lost. Today, it’s your turn. You’re pacing the dueling room 
when you stumble across something that just might change everything: your father hid a camera in the room. The tape shows him lay
out the 22 cards of the major Arcana. Fate then places an additional card,
the Soul, and speaks: “You may take any card that has 
at least one factor on the table. I’ll then receive every factor. Take the Tower, for example. It is 16, with factors 1, 2, 4, and 8. Those now belong to me,
making our score 16 to 15. If your total at the end of the game
is higher than mine, you’ll win. Play again and know that if you
run out of moves, I’ll take all the cards that remain.” As the game continues, Fate remarks that if your father 
were to win and hold the 10, that would grant him great fortune. 6, true love. And the 2 would end 
the family curse forever. But none of that matters because 
in the end his total comes up short. As the video turns to static,
Fate arrives. Feeling as if you’re in a dream, you hear her offer you the Tower 
to begin the game. How can you defeat Fate, and what other good fortune
can you win for yourself? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If you want to outplay Fate, 
you’ll need to take the long view. Accepting the 16 gives Fate
the 1, 2, 4, and 8. She effectively has the 23, 19,
17, and 13 too, since you can’t take prime numbers
once 1 is off the board. Smaller primes like 11, 7, 5, and 3
will also go to Fate, but you’ll be able to take 
their multiples, like 22 and 21. That means these are the remaining
cards in play. You can eventually claim at most
half of them, rounded down, since Fate gets at least one
for each card you take. So the best you can possibly do is
take the seven largest cards. Add those together with the 16 
and your total would be 138. And Fate’s total? Also, 138. Ties go to Fate, so it’s clear that
by offering your ancestors the 16 before explaining the full rules, Fate has been manipulating the game
to guarantee her victory. But thanks to your father,
you now know better. Speaking of your family, if you want 
to take the 2 and break the curse, you’ll have to do it on your first turn,
since it’s prime. If you do, Fate will get 1, and once again, 
Fate is guaranteed the high primes. In theory, you can get at most 
8 of the remaining 17 cards. Taking the eight largest would give 
you a nail-bitingly narrow victory of 140 to 136. But is it possible? You need Fate to get as few cards 
as possible for each one you take. You can start with the 22 and 14. With the 7 gone, 
you can take the 21, then the 15. You still need these, and the next one
you take will give Fate two cards. That’s okay though. Try the 16, for example,
and Fate gets the 4 and the 8, but you’ll still get the 12, the 18,
and the 20. Following similar reasoning, you could take the 23 on your first turn
and win the 10 or the 6. But claiming more than one
reward is impossible. So do you take wealth, love,
or break the curse? Fate is waiting, 
but the choice is up to you.

take the seven largest cards. Add those together with the 16 
and your total would be 138. And Fate’s total? Also, 138. Ties go to Fate, so it’s clear that
by offering your ancestors the 16 before explaining the full rules, Fate has been manipulating the game
to guarantee her victory. But thanks to your father,
you now know better. Speaking of your family, if you want 
to take the 2 and break the curse, you’ll have to do it on your first turn,
since it’s prime. If you do, Fate will get 1, and once again, 
Fate is guaranteed the high primes. In theory, you can get at most 
8 of the remaining 17 cards. Taking the eight largest would give 
you a nail-bitingly narrow victory of 140 to 136. But is it possible? You need Fate to get as few cards 
as possible for each one you take. You can start with the 22 and 14. With the 7 gone, 
you can take the 21, then the 15. You still need these, and the next one
you take will give Fate two cards. That’s okay though. Try the 16, for example,
and Fate gets the 4 and the 8, but you’ll still get the 12, the 18,
and the 20. Following similar reasoning, you could take the 23 on your first turn
and win the 10 or the 6. But claiming more than one
reward is impossible. So do you take wealth, love,
or break the curse? Fate is waiting, 
but the choice is up to you.

**Transcript**:
Legend has it, hundreds of years ago
a distant ancestor of yours stole a magical tarot deck 
from Fate herself. Today, your family is known the world over
as the world’s greatest fortune tellers. While the deck has increased 
your fortunes many times over, it came with a terrible cost. Once every 23 years, 
a door appears in your house. One member of your family must enter, and face Fate in a duel with arcane rules
only known to your opponent. And every time, 
generation after generation, the outcome is the same: Fate claims their soul. 23 years ago, your father accepted 
the challenge and lost. Today, it’s your turn. You’re pacing the dueling room 
when you stumble across something that just might change everything: your father hid a camera in the room. The tape shows him lay
out the 22 cards of the major Arcana. Fate then places an additional card,
the Soul, and speaks: “You may take any card that has 
at least one factor on the table. I’ll then receive every factor. Take the Tower, for example. It is 16, with factors 1, 2, 4, and 8. Those now belong to me,
making our score 16 to 15. If your total at the end of the game
is higher than mine, you’ll win. Play again and know that if you
run out of moves, I’ll take all the cards that remain.” As the game continues, Fate remarks that if your father 
were to win and hold the 10, that would grant him great fortune. 6, true love. And the 2 would end 
the family curse forever. But none of that matters because 
in the end his total comes up short. As the video turns to static,
Fate arrives. Feeling as if you’re in a dream, you hear her offer you the Tower 
to begin the game. How can you defeat Fate, and what other good fortune
can you win for yourself? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If you want to outplay Fate, 
you’ll need to take the long view. Accepting the 16 gives Fate
the 1, 2, 4, and 8. She effectively has the 23, 19,
17, and 13 too, since you can’t take prime numbers
once 1 is off the board. Smaller primes like 11, 7, 5, and 3
will also go to Fate, but you’ll be able to take 
their multiples, like 22 and 21. That means these are the remaining
cards in play. You can eventually claim at most
half of them, rounded down, since Fate gets at least one
for each card you take. So the best you can possibly do is
take the seven largest cards. Add those together with the 16 
and your total would be 138. And Fate’s total? Also, 138. Ties go to Fate, so it’s clear that

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the options for the player's first move, and the correct answer is "You can take any card except for 1, since that’s not a legal move, as Fate can’t take a number."

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 7: "What is the card that Fate offers to the player at the beginning of the game?" Although this question does not directly ask about the player's options for their first move, it is related to the starting point of the game.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question intent, I would suggest Question 1: "What is the rule of the game that Fate plays with the family members every 23 years?" This question is about the game's rules, which is somewhat related to the player's options for their first move.

But since neither of these questions is a good match, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level.

Index: 1 (with low confidence)

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about whether taking 16 first, like the father did, is a good move or a bad move. The correct answer is that it's a bad move because the best you can do in the game is end with a tie score, and Fate wins ties.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 7 is the most relevant, as it asks about the card that Fate offers to the player at the beginning of the game. However, it doesn't directly address the strategic implications of taking that card.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 7, but with the caveat that it doesn't fully capture the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Ebola is one of the deadliest
viruses we know of. If left untreated, it kills
about half of those it infects. It can spread through pretty much
every fluid your body makes, including blood and sweat. Even the dead can transmit the disease,
often doing so at their own funerals. On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy
in southern Guinea got sick. Just two days later, he died. It took local doctors working 
with the international community four months to discover 
that Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been
detected outside of Central Africa. In those four months, Ebola gained 
a head start that would prove devastating. The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest
Ebola epidemic in recorded history. More than 28,000 people contracted
the disease and over 11,000 died. In 2013, Guinea had no formal
emergency response system, few trained contact tracers,
and no rapid tests, border screenings,
or licensed vaccine for Ebola. After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US 
and other international partners, completely overhauled 
their epidemic response system. And in January 2021, that system
faced its first real test. It started when a nurse in southern Guinea
developed a headache, vomiting, and fever. A few days later, she died. As dictated by traditional
burial practices, her family prepared her body 
for the funeral. Within a week, the nurse’s husband
and other family members started experiencing symptoms. Health officials suspected Ebola much
quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests. They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic 
alert system the next day. Then, lots of things
happened very quickly. Guinea’s National Agency 
for Health Security activated 38 district-level 
emergency operations centers, as well as a national one. Teams of epidemiologists and
contact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was
exposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts
that quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun 
up in the city where the outbreak started. At Guinea’s borders
with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened
more than 2 million travelers. A large-scale vaccination
campaign was started. And, finally, more than 900
community mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices
that were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola. Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended
just four months after it began. Only 23 people contracted Ebola;
only 12 died. That's less than 1% of the deaths
in the prior outbreak. The 2021 outbreak cost 
$100 million to control— which sounds like a lot
but pales in comparison to the global economic cost
of the previous outbreak: $53 billion. So should every country just copy
Guinea’s approach? Not exactly. It is always important to respond
to an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential. But beyond that, a successful response
can look very different for different diseases 
in different countries. For example, Brazil quenched
an outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive
vaccination campaign. That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global
producers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed
to regular, routine vaccinations. But for many diseases, you don't even
need a mass vaccination program. In August of 2021, a truck driver tested
positive for cholera in Burkina Faso. Health care workers alerted 
the government that same day and contact tracing began immediately. Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those
exposed or potentially exposed. This extremely fast response 
stopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started. Cholera often rears its head
in West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases
and more than 3,700 deaths. Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared,
they had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, 
health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven
outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some
animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health
authorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months,
36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system
to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued,
and ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are,
in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs,
and practices with which they live. Perhaps most importantly, we can't
expect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action
when an outbreak occurs. One of the best ways to save lives is to
invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that Question 2 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ. Although the question phrasing is different, the intent and content of Question 2 are closest to the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly states the lack of a formal response system, few trained contact tracers, and no licensed vaccine as contributing factors to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Guinea.

Since none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, which is:

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 4: How many people contracted Ebola during the 2021 outbreak in Guinea?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the duration of the outbreak, it is related to the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea, which is the same topic as the ground truth MCQ. However, a more relevant question is needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ would be one that directly asks about the duration of the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 5: What was the estimated cost of controlling the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea?**

This question is related to the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea and provides some information about the outbreak. The transcript mentions that the outbreak lasted for 4 months and cost $100 million to control. Therefore, question 5 is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, but it does not directly ask about the duration of the outbreak.

If a new generated MCQ were to be created to match the ground truth MCQ, it could be:

**New Question: How long did the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea last?**

Options: A. 2 months, B. 4 months, C. 6 months, D. 1 year

This new question directly matches the ground truth MCQ and provides the same information.

However, based on the available generated MCQs, I would choose question 5 as the most similar, although it is not a direct match.

health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven
outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some
animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health
authorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months,
36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system
to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued,
and ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are,
in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs,

expect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action
when an outbreak occurs. One of the best ways to save lives is to
invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.

**Transcript**:
Ebola is one of the deadliest
viruses we know of. If left untreated, it kills
about half of those it infects. It can spread through pretty much
every fluid your body makes, including blood and sweat. Even the dead can transmit the disease,
often doing so at their own funerals. On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy
in southern Guinea got sick. Just two days later, he died. It took local doctors working 
with the international community four months to discover 
that Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been
detected outside of Central Africa. In those four months, Ebola gained 
a head start that would prove devastating. The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest
Ebola epidemic in recorded history. More than 28,000 people contracted
the disease and over 11,000 died. In 2013, Guinea had no formal
emergency response system, few trained contact tracers,
and no rapid tests, border screenings,
or licensed vaccine for Ebola. After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US 
and other international partners, completely overhauled 
their epidemic response system. And in January 2021, that system
faced its first real test. It started when a nurse in southern Guinea
developed a headache, vomiting, and fever. A few days later, she died. As dictated by traditional
burial practices, her family prepared her body 
for the funeral. Within a week, the nurse’s husband
and other family members started experiencing symptoms. Health officials suspected Ebola much
quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests. They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic 
alert system the next day. Then, lots of things
happened very quickly. Guinea’s National Agency 
for Health Security activated 38 district-level 
emergency operations centers, as well as a national one. Teams of epidemiologists and
contact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was
exposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts
that quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun 
up in the city where the outbreak started. At Guinea’s borders
with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened
more than 2 million travelers. A large-scale vaccination
campaign was started. And, finally, more than 900
community mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices
that were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola. Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended
just four months after it began. Only 23 people contracted Ebola;
only 12 died. That's less than 1% of the deaths
in the prior outbreak. The 2021 outbreak cost 
$100 million to control— which sounds like a lot
but pales in comparison to the global economic cost
of the previous outbreak: $53 billion. So should every country just copy
Guinea’s approach? Not exactly. It is always important to respond
to an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential. But beyond that, a successful response
can look very different for different diseases 
in different countries. For example, Brazil quenched
an outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive
vaccination campaign. That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global
producers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed
to regular, routine vaccinations. But for many diseases, you don't even
need a mass vaccination program. In August of 2021, a truck driver tested
positive for cholera in Burkina Faso. Health care workers alerted 
the government that same day and contact tracing began immediately. Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those
exposed or potentially exposed. This extremely fast response 
stopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started. Cholera often rears its head
in West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases
and more than 3,700 deaths. Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared,
they had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, 
health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven
outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some
animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health
authorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months,
36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system
to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued,
and ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are,
in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs,
and practices with which they live. Perhaps most importantly, we can't

invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.

**Transcript**:
For almost two millennia,
the Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority
for Catholics around the world. But in the late 14th century, 
Catholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes. Where did this plethora of popes
come from? And who among them was
the genuine article? The origins of this papal predicament
began in 1296, when France’s King Philip IV decided
to raise taxes on the Church. Given the clergy’s political power, this offended Pope Boniface VIII,
leading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”: a radical decree asserting the Pope’s
total supremacy over earthly rulers. But King Philip struck back. He declared Boniface a heretic and tried
to have him arrested in a violent raid. Boniface survived the assault,
but died soon after. And following a short-lived successor,
Pope Clement V was elected in 1305. A French diplomat seeking peace in the war
between England and his homeland, Clement wanted to stay close
to the conflict and escape the demands of Rome. So in 1309, he moved the seat 
of the papacy to Avignon— a city close to France but owned
by a vassal of the Church. The papacy remained here 
for the terms of seven popes until the reigning Pope finally returned
to Italy in 1376. But just several months after his arrival,
he suddenly died. This shocking development meant a new
pope had to be elected immediately— and in Rome, where there hadn’t been
a papal election in over 70 years. The Romans were determined 
to elect one of their own and restore Rome as the seat
of Western Christendom. Local officials pressured cardinals
to choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave
and plundered the papal wine cellar. Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected
the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI. Initially, Urban was seen 
as a safe choice. But he quickly proved to be a reformer who
sought to limit the cardinal’s finances. Desperate to maintain 
their luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared 
the recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure
from the Roman mob. They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave 
to elect Pope Clement VII. Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize
the authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals. Urban named new cardinals to his court 
and entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters 
returned to Avignon. The schism had officially begun. Western Christendom now had two capitals,
Avignon and Rome, each with their own Pope
and court of cardinals. As popes from each line died, 
their cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades. This strange situation didn't impact
most ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant
doctrinal splits. Instead, the drama played 
out in the diplomatic realm. European rulers were forced 
to choose sides, as both popes vied 
for spiritual and political supremacy. Only a pope had the authority 
to call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step. So in 1409, a group of cardinals 
from France and Rome took matters into their own hands. They claimed that since both
popes were disputed, cardinals did have the right
to call a council. And at their gathering these cardinals
deposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope. Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope 
and Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council. So instead of solving the crisis, 
the number of popes rose to three. This unusual arrangement 
lasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line
and recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church
under a new Pope— Martin V. Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated
the only person still against him— the Pope of Avignon— and finally ended the schism
after 39 years. Today, the church’s official records
say the Roman Line was always the true papal power. But regardless of how the schism ended, its existence proves that even those 
who are supposed to be pious are prone to petty power struggles.

the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI. Initially, Urban was seen 
as a safe choice. But he quickly proved to be a reformer who
sought to limit the cardinal’s finances. Desperate to maintain 
their luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared 
the recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure
from the Roman mob. They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave 
to elect Pope Clement VII. Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize
the authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals. Urban named new cardinals to his court 
and entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters 
returned to Avignon. The schism had officially begun. Western Christendom now had two capitals,
Avignon and Rome, each with their own Pope
and court of cardinals. As popes from each line died, 
their cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades. This strange situation didn't impact
most ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant
doctrinal splits. Instead, the drama played 
out in the diplomatic realm. European rulers were forced 
to choose sides, as both popes vied 
for spiritual and political supremacy. Only a pope had the authority 
to call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step. So in 1409, a group of cardinals 
from France and Rome took matters into their own hands. They claimed that since both
popes were disputed, cardinals did have the right
to call a council. And at their gathering these cardinals
deposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope. Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope 
and Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council. So instead of solving the crisis, 
the number of popes rose to three. This unusual arrangement 
lasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line
and recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church
under a new Pope— Martin V. Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated
the only person still against him— the Pope of Avignon— and finally ended the schism
after 39 years. Today, the church’s official records
say the Roman Line was always the true papal power. But regardless of how the schism ended, its existence proves that even those 
who are supposed to be pious are prone to petty power struggles.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest that Question 7 is the closest match.

Although Question 7 does not directly ask about the capitals of Christianity during the Schism, it does relate to the broader topic of the schism and its causes. However, a more relevant question would be one that directly asks about the capitals or the seats of the papacy during the Schism.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. A new question that directly addresses the topic of the capitals or seats of the papacy during the Schism would be a better match.

Example of a new question that would be a better match:
What were the two cities that served as the seats of the papacy during the Western Schism?
Options: A. Rome and Avignon, B. Paris and London, C. Rome and Ravenna, D. Avignon and Paris

This new question directly addresses the topic of the ground truth MCQ and would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
For almost two millennia,
the Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority
for Catholics around the world. But in the late 14th century, 
Catholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes. Where did this plethora of popes
come from? And who among them was
the genuine article? The origins of this papal predicament
began in 1296, when France’s King Philip IV decided
to raise taxes on the Church. Given the clergy’s political power, this offended Pope Boniface VIII,
leading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”: a radical decree asserting the Pope’s
total supremacy over earthly rulers. But King Philip struck back. He declared Boniface a heretic and tried
to have him arrested in a violent raid. Boniface survived the assault,
but died soon after. And following a short-lived successor,
Pope Clement V was elected in 1305. A French diplomat seeking peace in the war
between England and his homeland, Clement wanted to stay close
to the conflict and escape the demands of Rome. So in 1309, he moved the seat 
of the papacy to Avignon— a city close to France but owned
by a vassal of the Church. The papacy remained here 
for the terms of seven popes until the reigning Pope finally returned
to Italy in 1376. But just several months after his arrival,
he suddenly died. This shocking development meant a new
pope had to be elected immediately— and in Rome, where there hadn’t been
a papal election in over 70 years. The Romans were determined 
to elect one of their own and restore Rome as the seat
of Western Christendom. Local officials pressured cardinals
to choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave
and plundered the papal wine cellar. Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected
the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI. Initially, Urban was seen 
as a safe choice. But he quickly proved to be a reformer who

**Transcript**:
It’s 1526 in what is now Northern India, and Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi is
about to face off against a prince from Central Asia, 
Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur. To quash the threat, the Sultan brings 
his war elephants to battle. But it’s said that the explosions 
of Babur’s cannons and muskets startled the elephants and they trampled
the Sultan’s own army. Babur had long harbored ambitions
of building his own empire. Though he was descended from some
of the world’s most successful conquerors, he struggled to gain a foothold among the many ambitious princes
in Central Asia. So he turned his attention to India, where his descendants stayed 
and built the Mughal Empire, one of the wealthiest and most powerful
states in the early modern world and home to nearly a quarter
of the global population. Babur died just four years 
after that fateful battle, but his own memoirs and the work 
of his descendants immortalized him in colorful fashion. His daughter, Gulbadan, recalled
in her own memoir how Babur— having recently given up drinking— filled a newly-constructed pool 
with lemonade rather than wine. His grandson, Akbar, commissioned 
exquisite miniature paintings of Babur’s stories— one depicted the empire’s
founder riding through his camp, drunkenly slumped over his horse. It was Akbar who consolidated 
Mughal power. He established protections for peasants— which in turn increased their productivity
and generated more tax revenue— and embarked on military campaigns 
to expand Mughal territory. Princes who swore allegiance to him 
were rewarded, while he made brutal examples 
of those who resisted, killing them and many of their subjects. His conquests opened access 
to port cities on the Indian Ocean, which connected the Mughals to Arab,
Chinese, Ottoman, and European traders, bringing in incalculable wealth, including silver and new crops
from the Americas. As the Muslim ruler of a diverse,
multiethnic empire, Akbar worked to create internal cohesion
by appointing members of the Hindu majority to high positions
in his government, marrying a Hindu bride, and distributing translated copies 
of the “Mahabharata,” an ancient Indian epic poem,
to his Muslim nobles. Akbar also hosted lively religious debates
where Sunni and Shia Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, and the newly arrived 
Portuguese Jesuit missionaries defended the merits 
of their respective faiths. While most participants viewed this
as an intellectual exercise, Portuguese missionaries were disappointed
by their failure to convert Akbar. The Mughals built 
architectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, a palace three kilometers around,
that housed 50,000 people and contained the magnificent gold
and jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne. Just the throne took 
seven years to construct. During its first 180 years,
the Mughals had only six rulers, which contributed 
to the empire’s stability. When the fourth emperor, Jahangir, struggled with alcohol 
and opioid addiction, his wife, Nur Jahan, 
took the reins as co-ruler. When a traitorous general captured 
her husband in an attempted coup, she negotiated his release and rallied
the army to stop the rebellion. She once led a hunting party to track down
a tiger that was terrorizing a village, leading one poet to write: “Though Nur Jahan be in form of a woman/
In the ranks of men she’s a tiger-slayer.” Following the death of the sixth emperor,
Aurangzeb, in 1707, seven emperors took the throne
over the next 21 years. These frequent transitions 
of power reflected the larger political, economic, 
social, and environmental crises that plagued the empire 
throughout the 18th century. In response to this turmoil, regional leaders started refusing to pay
taxes and broke away from Mughal control. The British East India Company offered
military support to these regional rulers, which in turn increased the company's
political influence, enabling it to eventually take
direct control of Bengal, one of the wealthiest regions in India. By the 19th century, the East India
Company had massive political influence and a large standing army, 
which included Indian troops. When these troops revolted in 1857, aiming to force out the British
and restore Mughal influence, the British government intervened, replacing company rule 
with direct colonial rule, deposing the last Mughal emperor
and sending him into exile. And so, over three centuries 
after its founding, the Mughal Empire came to an end.

of Babur’s cannons and muskets startled the elephants and they trampled
the Sultan’s own army. Babur had long harbored ambitions
of building his own empire. Though he was descended from some
of the world’s most successful conquerors, he struggled to gain a foothold among the many ambitious princes
in Central Asia. So he turned his attention to India, where his descendants stayed 
and built the Mughal Empire, one of the wealthiest and most powerful
states in the early modern world and home to nearly a quarter
of the global population. Babur died just four years 
after that fateful battle, but his own memoirs and the work 
of his descendants immortalized him in colorful fashion. His daughter, Gulbadan, recalled
in her own memoir how Babur— having recently given up drinking— filled a newly-constructed pool 
with lemonade rather than wine. His grandson, Akbar, commissioned 
exquisite miniature paintings of Babur’s stories— one depicted the empire’s
founder riding through his camp, drunkenly slumped over his horse. It was Akbar who consolidated 
Mughal power. He established protections for peasants— which in turn increased their productivity
and generated more tax revenue— and embarked on military campaigns 
to expand Mughal territory. Princes who swore allegiance to him 
were rewarded, while he made brutal examples 
of those who resisted, killing them and many of their subjects. His conquests opened access 
to port cities on the Indian Ocean, which connected the Mughals to Arab,
Chinese, Ottoman, and European traders, bringing in incalculable wealth, including silver and new crops
from the Americas. As the Muslim ruler of a diverse,
multiethnic empire, Akbar worked to create internal cohesion
by appointing members of the Hindu majority to high positions
in his government, marrying a Hindu bride, and distributing translated copies 
of the “Mahabharata,” an ancient Indian epic poem,
to his Muslim nobles. Akbar also hosted lively religious debates
where Sunni and Shia Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, and the newly arrived 
Portuguese Jesuit missionaries defended the merits 
of their respective faiths. While most participants viewed this
as an intellectual exercise, Portuguese missionaries were disappointed
by their failure to convert Akbar. The Mughals built 
architectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, a palace three kilometers around,
that housed 50,000 people and contained the magnificent gold
and jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne. Just the throne took 
seven years to construct. During its first 180 years,
the Mughals had only six rulers, which contributed 
to the empire’s stability. When the fourth emperor, Jahangir, struggled with alcohol 
and opioid addiction, his wife, Nur Jahan, 
took the reins as co-ruler. When a traitorous general captured 
her husband in an attempted coup, she negotiated his release and rallied
the army to stop the rebellion. She once led a hunting party to track down
a tiger that was terrorizing a village, leading one poet to write: “Though Nur Jahan be in form of a woman/
In the ranks of men she’s a tiger-slayer.” Following the death of the sixth emperor,
Aurangzeb, in 1707, seven emperors took the throne
over the next 21 years. These frequent transitions 
of power reflected the larger political, economic, 
social, and environmental crises that plagued the empire 
throughout the 18th century. In response to this turmoil, regional leaders started refusing to pay
taxes and broke away from Mughal control. The British East India Company offered
military support to these regional rulers, which in turn increased the company's
political influence, enabling it to eventually take
direct control of Bengal, one of the wealthiest regions in India. By the 19th century, the East India
Company had massive political influence and a large standing army, 
which included Indian troops. When these troops revolted in 1857, aiming to force out the British
and restore Mughal influence, the British government intervened, replacing company rule 
with direct colonial rule, deposing the last Mughal emperor
and sending him into exile. And so, over three centuries 
after its founding, the Mughal Empire came to an end.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the closest match can be found in the questions related to Akbar's actions and policies.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the participants in Akbar's religious debates. While there isn't a direct match, Question 6 talks about Akbar's appointment of Hindu majority members to high positions in his government, which is related to his efforts to create internal cohesion and facilitate interfaith interactions.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall intent of promoting interfaith interactions and understanding Akbar's policies, I would choose Question 6 as the closest match, despite the difference in specific content.

All these ancient skulls have
perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly
never sporting braces. And this isn't some strange sample. According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars—
or wisdom teeth. In fact, the dental dilemmas
that fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today
appear to be recent developments. So what happened? While it’s nearly impossible
to know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis. A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived
a subsistence lifestyle. Their teeth and jaws had to work hard
to make the food they ate digestible. Indeed, the surfaces of many of their 
teeth show extensive wear and flattening. They also had larger jaws
and teeth overall. At some point, they began using tools
and fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down. A lot more time passed and,
around 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming
and domesticating animals and plants. Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people
to process and refine their food. Milling technologies helped remove
the tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran
from rice and wheat. Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically
accelerated these processes. In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved
of a great deal of their grinding, crushing, 
and pulverizing duties. And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness
appears to have become more common. Examining fossils
spanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed
a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors. Many think that, 
for most of human history, dietary shifts— like the introduction
of meat and the advent of cooking— were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size
basically kept pace with one another. But with the more recent revolutions
in agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed. As the theory goes, 
over a relatively short period, some human populations saw
a decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying
for limited space. When they do grow in,
they may displace others and get jostled into some
eccentric positions. And then wisdom teeth, which are usually
the last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further. In many cases, they have little
or no space to emerge. This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections
if not surgically removed. So larger jaws appear to be associated
with greater chewing demands. And many scientists think that as people's
diets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller—
and that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness
and impacted wisdom teeth. This hypothesis has been supported
by some preliminary experimental data. In a 1983 study, researchers
raised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough
or artificially soft food. Those fed softer food had 
more crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth, 
and narrower dental arches. And a 2004 study similarly observed
that hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth
in facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw 
and dried foods. In other words, the issue at large
seems to be environmental— or one of lifestyle—
instead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play
in some instances. It’s estimated that somewhere 
between 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding. But this trend varies 
across global populations. Some people naturally 
never have wisdom teeth. And some don’t experience 
tooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth
without a hitch. This seems to coincide with diets
that are less processed. So how can we prevent 
tooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics? Well, it’s certainly
something to chew over.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent, I can suggest a related question.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the approximate time when humans switched from a diet based on hunting/gathering to one based on domesticated plants and animals. The closest related question in the generated MCQs is not available, but Question 3 talks about the change in jawbone size over time.

However, if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 3. But please note that this is not a direct match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 3

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that explicitly asks about the time frame of the dietary shift, such as:

**Transcript**:
All these ancient skulls have
perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly
never sporting braces. And this isn't some strange sample. According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars—
or wisdom teeth. In fact, the dental dilemmas
that fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today
appear to be recent developments. So what happened? While it’s nearly impossible
to know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis. A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived
a subsistence lifestyle. Their teeth and jaws had to work hard
to make the food they ate digestible. Indeed, the surfaces of many of their 
teeth show extensive wear and flattening. They also had larger jaws
and teeth overall. At some point, they began using tools
and fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down. A lot more time passed and,
around 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming
and domesticating animals and plants. Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people
to process and refine their food. Milling technologies helped remove
the tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran
from rice and wheat. Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically
accelerated these processes. In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved
of a great deal of their grinding, crushing, 
and pulverizing duties. And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness
appears to have become more common. Examining fossils
spanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed
a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors. Many think that, 
for most of human history, dietary shifts— like the introduction
of meat and the advent of cooking— were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size
basically kept pace with one another. But with the more recent revolutions
in agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed. As the theory goes, 
over a relatively short period, some human populations saw
a decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying
for limited space. When they do grow in,
they may displace others and get jostled into some
eccentric positions. And then wisdom teeth, which are usually
the last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further. In many cases, they have little
or no space to emerge. This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections
if not surgically removed. So larger jaws appear to be associated
with greater chewing demands. And many scientists think that as people's
diets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller—
and that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness
and impacted wisdom teeth. This hypothesis has been supported
by some preliminary experimental data. In a 1983 study, researchers
raised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough
or artificially soft food. Those fed softer food had 
more crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth, 
and narrower dental arches. And a 2004 study similarly observed
that hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth
in facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw 
and dried foods. In other words, the issue at large
seems to be environmental— or one of lifestyle—
instead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play
in some instances. It’s estimated that somewhere 
between 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding. But this trend varies 
across global populations. Some people naturally 
never have wisdom teeth. And some don’t experience 
tooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth
without a hitch. This seems to coincide with diets
that are less processed. So how can we prevent 
tooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics? Well, it’s certainly
something to chew over.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, five Kenyan people
took a petition to the British Prime Minister’s office. They claimed they endured
human rights abuses in the 1950s, while Kenya was under British colonial
rule and demanded reparations. They had vivid accounts and physical scars
from their experiences— but their testimonies were undermined. They had no documentary evidence that
Britain sanctioned systems of torture against Kenyans—
at least, not yet. Thousands of secret files were
waiting to be discovered. In 2010, a historian joined 
the trial as an expert witness and attested to having seen references
to missing documents. They noted that Kenya had repeatedly
requested the return of stolen papers, which the British government had refused. In fact, many historians suspected
there were gaps in the archives. As a result, the court ordered the release
of any relevant documents. And, days later, British officials
acknowledged that 1,500 pertinent files were being held 
in a high-security archive. It soon became clear that these 
were just a small sample of documents Britain hid
between the 1950s and 70s, while former colonies 
declared independence, as part of a widespread colonial British 
policy called Operation Legacy. The policy was for British colonial
officers to destroy or remove documentation that 
might incriminate Britain and be of strategic value
to the new governments. They were instructed to destroy, alter, or secretly transport
these papers to the UK. Documents slated for destruction
were to be burnt to ashes or sunk in weighted crates far from shore. During the trial, between 2010 and 2013, an independent historian revealed 
they had located more than 20,000 previously hidden 
Operation Legacy files from 37 former colonies. Finally, an estimated 1.2 million 
colonial files, sprawling kilometers in the archive’s 
so-called “Special Collections,” were also exposed. And these were only the documents
that British forces kept. How many were destroyed— 
and what information they contained— remains unknown. About 3.5 tons of colonial documents 
were slated for incineration in Kenya. Ultimately, Operation Legacy’s objective
was to obscure critical aspects of the truth. In the words of Britain’s
attorney-general in Kenya, “If we are going to sin, 
we must sin quietly.” So, what really happened in Kenya? Beginning in 1895, the British
administration forcibly removed people from their traditional lands, giving the most fertile areas to European
settlers to establish large-scale farms. They mandated forced labor systems, implemented reservations 
for Indigenous African peoples, and restricted their movement. Kenyan people resisted 
these incursions from the start and grew increasingly organized over time. One movement, 
the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, aimed to forcibly remove white settlers
and overthrow the colonial government. When the British declared 
a state of emergency in 1952, they were giving themselves permission 
to take otherwise illegal special measures to regain control. The newly revealed 
Operation Legacy documents confirmed that people suspected 
of participating in the resistance were subjected to horrible abuses. Between 1952 and 1959, the British imprisoned 
over 80,000 people without trial, sentenced over 1,000 people convicted
as terrorists to death, and imposed extreme surveillance
and interrogation tactics. Some people were beaten to death. Others were raped or castrated. Many were shackled at the wrist for years. Children were killed. One person was burnt alive. Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua testified 
to being castrated while handcuffed and blindfolded. Wambugu Wa Nyingi said he was
suspended upside-down, beaten, and had water thrown on his face
until he could barely breathe. Jane Muthoni Mara said she was 
sexually violated with a hot bottle, and imprisoned for years without cause. In response to the new evidence, the British government issued
a formal apology, and made an out-of-court 
financial settlement with the 5,228 Kenyan claimants 
ultimately involved in the case. The original five claimants 
had made history— and paved the way for it 
to be rightfully rewritten. The uncovered files challenge fundamental
myths about British colonialism as a benevolent institution that brought
freedom and democracy to its subjects, then graciously gave them independence. Instead, the newly exposed evidence
confirms what many people knew to be true, because they lived it— and survived to rescue history
from the ashes.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the British occupation of Kenya at the end of the 19th century, specifically what was NOT part of the occupation. The generated MCQs do not directly address this question. However, Question 7 mentions the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, which is related to the Kenyan resistance movement during the British occupation.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest that Question 7 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it is related to the Kenyan resistance movement during the British occupation, which is the context of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, five Kenyan people
took a petition to the British Prime Minister’s office. They claimed they endured
human rights abuses in the 1950s, while Kenya was under British colonial
rule and demanded reparations. They had vivid accounts and physical scars
from their experiences— but their testimonies were undermined. They had no documentary evidence that
Britain sanctioned systems of torture against Kenyans—
at least, not yet. Thousands of secret files were
waiting to be discovered. In 2010, a historian joined 
the trial as an expert witness and attested to having seen references
to missing documents. They noted that Kenya had repeatedly
requested the return of stolen papers, which the British government had refused. In fact, many historians suspected
there were gaps in the archives. As a result, the court ordered the release
of any relevant documents. And, days later, British officials
acknowledged that 1,500 pertinent files were being held 
in a high-security archive. It soon became clear that these 
were just a small sample of documents Britain hid
between the 1950s and 70s, while former colonies 
declared independence, as part of a widespread colonial British 
policy called Operation Legacy. The policy was for British colonial
officers to destroy or remove documentation that 
might incriminate Britain and be of strategic value
to the new governments. They were instructed to destroy, alter, or secretly transport
these papers to the UK. Documents slated for destruction
were to be burnt to ashes or sunk in weighted crates far from shore. During the trial, between 2010 and 2013, an independent historian revealed 
they had located more than 20,000 previously hidden 
Operation Legacy files from 37 former colonies. Finally, an estimated 1.2 million 
colonial files, sprawling kilometers in the archive’s 
so-called “Special Collections,” were also exposed. And these were only the documents
that British forces kept. How many were destroyed— 
and what information they contained— remains unknown. About 3.5 tons of colonial documents 
were slated for incineration in Kenya. Ultimately, Operation Legacy’s objective
was to obscure critical aspects of the truth. In the words of Britain’s
attorney-general in Kenya, “If we are going to sin, 
we must sin quietly.” So, what really happened in Kenya? Beginning in 1895, the British
administration forcibly removed people from their traditional lands, giving the most fertile areas to European
settlers to establish large-scale farms. They mandated forced labor systems, implemented reservations 
for Indigenous African peoples, and restricted their movement. Kenyan people resisted 
these incursions from the start and grew increasingly organized over time. One movement, 
the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, aimed to forcibly remove white settlers
and overthrow the colonial government. When the British declared 
a state of emergency in 1952, they were giving themselves permission 
to take otherwise illegal special measures to regain control. The newly revealed 
Operation Legacy documents confirmed that people suspected 
of participating in the resistance were subjected to horrible abuses. Between 1952 and 1959, the British imprisoned 
over 80,000 people without trial, sentenced over 1,000 people convicted
as terrorists to death, and imposed extreme surveillance
and interrogation tactics. Some people were beaten to death. Others were raped or castrated. Many were shackled at the wrist for years. Children were killed. One person was burnt alive. Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua testified 
to being castrated while handcuffed and blindfolded. Wambugu Wa Nyingi said he was
suspended upside-down, beaten, and had water thrown on his face
until he could barely breathe. Jane Muthoni Mara said she was 
sexually violated with a hot bottle, and imprisoned for years without cause. In response to the new evidence, the British government issued
a formal apology, and made an out-of-court 
financial settlement with the 5,228 Kenyan claimants 
ultimately involved in the case. The original five claimants 
had made history— and paved the way for it 
to be rightfully rewritten. The uncovered files challenge fundamental
myths about British colonialism as a benevolent institution that brought
freedom and democracy to its subjects, then graciously gave them independence. Instead, the newly exposed evidence
confirms what many people knew to be true, because they lived it— and survived to rescue history
from the ashes.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the tactics used by the British in response to Kenyan uprisings when they declared a state of emergency in 1952. The correct answer is "All of the above," which includes prison without trial, extreme surveillance and interrogation, and death sentences for individuals convicted as "terrorists."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 partially matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, as it asks about the number of people imprisoned without trial by the British between 1952 and 1959. However, it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent and options.

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, native Takhi 
horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia. But by the late 1960s, 
they’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling 
in meager habitats against hunters and competition 
from local livestock. Some small groups of Takhi
survived in European zoos, but their extinction 
still seemed inevitable. To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos
pulled together to start an international 
Takhi breeding program. By the 1990s, these collaborators
in Europe and the US began releasing new generations 
of Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat. This Takhi revival was a world-famous
conservation victory, but the full story is much more
complicated than it first appears. And its twists and turns raise serious
questions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means. To get the whole story, 
we need to start in the late 1800s when Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky
was gifted the remains of one of these wild horses. Though the Takhi had long been
known to local Mongolians, European scientists were intrigued
by the remains, which looked more like those of a donkey
or zebra than any known domestic horse. They concluded the species was a sort
of missing link between wild asses and modern horses. And as reports of the newly dubbed 
Przhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire
the previously unknown species. At this time, zoos were focused primarily
on drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned
with entertainment than animal welfare. But in the early 1900s, the near
extinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species
like the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand 
as centers for conservation. And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s
horse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain
the captive population. However, the individuals behind these
programs came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred. Like their colleagues, they believed
the species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses 
and their more primitive ancestors. They also knew that some of the horses in
their collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble 
the species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them
to determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly. Basing their work on just a few specimens
and broad beliefs about what a primitive horse 
might look like, they created a rigorous model 
for the ideal Takhi. And over the 20th century, breeders in western zoos 
and private collections created a population 
of thousands of horses all carefully bred to share the same
physical characteristics. Of course, in their native habitat, wild Takhi had regularly interbred 
with domesticated horses for millennia, producing a population with much
more diverse appearances. So when it was time to introduce 
the Takhi to their ancestral home, they were quite different from the horses who’d been taken from those steppes
a century earlier. Complicating things even further, while these new Takhi herds were
no longer in zoos, to this day, almost all 
remain closely monitored and controlled for their own protection. So in a strange way, it’s hard to say 
if these animals are actually in the wild or even if they’re truly Takhi. The story of the Takhi horse 
is not unique. In many of our conservation victories, it’s difficult to say exactly
what was saved, and the role that zoos play 
in conservation can be very complicated. It's clear that zoos have been and can
continue to be significant forces for animal preservation, especially efforts to save 
charismatic animals from extinction. But today, the most direct
cause of animal extinctions are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats
and Earth’s climate. So if zoos truly want to help protect the
diversity of animal life on this planet, perhaps they should redirect their efforts to preserving the natural habitats
these animals so desperately need.

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, native Takhi 
horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia. But by the late 1960s, 
they’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling 
in meager habitats against hunters and competition 
from local livestock. Some small groups of Takhi
survived in European zoos, but their extinction 
still seemed inevitable. To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos
pulled together to start an international 
Takhi breeding program. By the 1990s, these collaborators
in Europe and the US began releasing new generations 
of Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat. This Takhi revival was a world-famous
conservation victory, but the full story is much more
complicated than it first appears. And its twists and turns raise serious
questions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means. To get the whole story, 
we need to start in the late 1800s when Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky
was gifted the remains of one of these wild horses. Though the Takhi had long been
known to local Mongolians, European scientists were intrigued
by the remains, which looked more like those of a donkey
or zebra than any known domestic horse. They concluded the species was a sort
of missing link between wild asses and modern horses. And as reports of the newly dubbed 
Przhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire
the previously unknown species. At this time, zoos were focused primarily
on drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned
with entertainment than animal welfare. But in the early 1900s, the near
extinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species
like the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand 
as centers for conservation. And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s
horse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain
the captive population. However, the individuals behind these
programs came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred. Like their colleagues, they believed
the species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses 
and their more primitive ancestors. They also knew that some of the horses in
their collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble 
the species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them
to determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly. Basing their work on just a few specimens
and broad beliefs about what a primitive horse 
might look like, they created a rigorous model 
for the ideal Takhi. And over the 20th century, breeders in western zoos 
and private collections created a population 
of thousands of horses all carefully bred to share the same
physical characteristics. Of course, in their native habitat, wild Takhi had regularly interbred 
with domesticated horses for millennia, producing a population with much
more diverse appearances. So when it was time to introduce 
the Takhi to their ancestral home, they were quite different from the horses who’d been taken from those steppes
a century earlier. Complicating things even further, while these new Takhi herds were
no longer in zoos, to this day, almost all 
remain closely monitored and controlled for their own protection. So in a strange way, it’s hard to say 
if these animals are actually in the wild or even if they’re truly Takhi. The story of the Takhi horse 
is not unique. In many of our conservation victories, it’s difficult to say exactly
what was saved, and the role that zoos play 
in conservation can be very complicated. It's clear that zoos have been and can
continue to be significant forces for animal preservation, especially efforts to save 
charismatic animals from extinction. But today, the most direct
cause of animal extinctions are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats
and Earth’s climate. So if zoos truly want to help protect the
diversity of animal life on this planet, perhaps they should redirect their efforts to preserving the natural habitats
these animals so desperately need.

**Transcript**:
1,700 years ago, a Chinese
alchemist named Ge Hong was renowned for his special soup that
could cure diarrhea-stricken patients. The stew was deep yellow,
and had an intense aroma. And, like many family recipes,
it had a secret ingredient. But in this case, that ingredient
didn’t come from the kitchen— it came from the bathroom. It might seem unwise to consume feces, and today, there aren’t many doctors 
who would prescribe Ge Hong’s recipe. However, exciting new research suggests
that taking poop into the body in other ways might benefit our health. One such treatment 
is fecal microbial transplantation, and the secret to how it works
lives in your gut. Trillions and trillions of bacteria, 
viruses, fungi, and archaea consider your bowels their home. Collectively, these microbes make 
up what’s known as your gut microbiome, and each of these organisms
possesses dynamic, specialized abilities that seem to be essential for human life. They break down our food, make vitamins, train our immune system
and circadian rhythm, and even protect us from infections. In return, they receive 
a nice warm place to live, complete with an all-you-can-eat buffet. Some research suggests our microbiomes
might start forming in the womb, but if not, they certainly get
started when we're born. During a vaginal birth, infants take 
in some of their mother’s fecal matter and microbe-filled fluids. From then on, our microbiomes 
are constantly diversifying with exposure to various 
foods and environments. This is essential for maintaining 
gut health. If poor nutrition, chronic disease or
antibiotics disturb this delicate balance, the body can become vulnerable to problems like bacteria and fungal overgrowth 
or infectious diarrhea. But infusing a new batch
of microorganisms into the intestine seems to help reset the gut microbiome— this is where fecal microbial transplants
come into play. This line of treatment is still very new, and there are tons of unanswered
questions about how it works. So currently, the US Food and Drug
Administration only allows doctors to use fecal transplants experimentally for battling one of the toughest 
gut infections— antibiotic-resistant 
Clostridiodes difficile. This infectious bacterium forms spores in
the colon that are immune to antibiotics and very difficult to destroy. Patients dealing with this infection can
experience months of intermittent fevers alongside bouts of abdominal cramping

for a fecal microbial transplant. To start the process, a gastroenterologist first retrieves 
some feces, typically from a stool bank. These frozen samples are particularly
impressive number twos— the selected donors go 
through a strict process to ensure their samples 
are infection-free. In fact, these protective protocols
are so stringent, one prominent stool bank’s 
acceptance rate is less than 3%. Next, the gastroenterologist gets 
that sample inside the patient via a pill, or, more commonly, a tube 
into the stomach or colon. Finally, the transplanted microbes 
migrate through the tract until they find the colon, where they quickly multiply
and displace the infectious invader. This process is so effective that it cures
over 80% of patients in just one treatment. Because each stool sample is unique, the FDA still classifies fecal transplants
as an experimental treatment rather than a formal medication. But promising research in rodents 
suggests new ways we might use fecal bacteriotherapy
in the future. For example, fecal transplants 
from non-diabetic mice improved insulin resistance in mice
with type 2 diabetes. Similarly, some studies have shown
mice exhibiting anxiety and depression become calmer after transplants 
from their less anxious peers. Scientists studying humans have 
even started finding different microbial patterns associated with various intestinal,
autoimmune, oncologic, and even psychiatric disorders. So, it seems entirely possible
that altering a patient’s microbiome could allow for multiple new modes
of treatment. We still have a lot to learn about what
makes the “best” gut microbiome, or the most beneficial fecal transplants. But for now, at least we can say
that our feces have a bright future.

**Transcript**:
1,700 years ago, a Chinese
alchemist named Ge Hong was renowned for his special soup that
could cure diarrhea-stricken patients. The stew was deep yellow,
and had an intense aroma. And, like many family recipes,
it had a secret ingredient. But in this case, that ingredient
didn’t come from the kitchen— it came from the bathroom. It might seem unwise to consume feces, and today, there aren’t many doctors 
who would prescribe Ge Hong’s recipe. However, exciting new research suggests
that taking poop into the body in other ways might benefit our health. One such treatment 
is fecal microbial transplantation, and the secret to how it works
lives in your gut. Trillions and trillions of bacteria, 
viruses, fungi, and archaea consider your bowels their home. Collectively, these microbes make 
up what’s known as your gut microbiome, and each of these organisms
possesses dynamic, specialized abilities that seem to be essential for human life. They break down our food, make vitamins, train our immune system
and circadian rhythm, and even protect us from infections. In return, they receive 
a nice warm place to live, complete with an all-you-can-eat buffet. Some research suggests our microbiomes
might start forming in the womb, but if not, they certainly get
started when we're born. During a vaginal birth, infants take 
in some of their mother’s fecal matter and microbe-filled fluids. From then on, our microbiomes 
are constantly diversifying with exposure to various 
foods and environments. This is essential for maintaining 
gut health. If poor nutrition, chronic disease or
antibiotics disturb this delicate balance, the body can become vulnerable to problems like bacteria and fungal overgrowth 
or infectious diarrhea. But infusing a new batch
of microorganisms into the intestine seems to help reset the gut microbiome— this is where fecal microbial transplants
come into play. This line of treatment is still very new, and there are tons of unanswered
questions about how it works. So currently, the US Food and Drug
Administration only allows doctors to use fecal transplants experimentally for battling one of the toughest 
gut infections— antibiotic-resistant 
Clostridiodes difficile. This infectious bacterium forms spores in
the colon that are immune to antibiotics and very difficult to destroy. Patients dealing with this infection can
experience months of intermittent fevers alongside bouts of abdominal cramping 
and extreme diarrhea despite antibiotic treatment. So when symptoms get this bad, it’s time
for a fecal microbial transplant. To start the process, a gastroenterologist first retrieves 
some feces, typically from a stool bank. These frozen samples are particularly
impressive number twos— the selected donors go

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the options provided. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a potential serious risk of a fecal microbial transplant, and the correct option is "Infection of the gut." Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the risks of fecal microbial transplantation. However, Question 5 mentions factors that can disrupt the delicate balance of the gut microbiome, including antibiotics, which can be related to the risk of infection.

Although not a perfect match, I would suggest that Question 5 is the closest generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, as it touches on the idea of disrupting the balance of the gut microbiome, which can lead to infections.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: How is a fecal microbial transplant typically administered? Options: A. Through a pill, B. Through a tube into the stomach or colon, C. Through a surgical procedure, D. Both A and B 

However, the correct generated MCQ is not an exact match for the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be: 

Question: Where does a fecal transplant come from?
Options: A. A stool bank, B. A microbial laboratory, C. An animal donor, D. A kitchen recipe

Since this question does not exist among the generated MCQs, the closest match would be a question that involves the source or method of fecal transplant administration.

A more suitable match can be found in the transcript: "To start the process, a gastroenterologist first retrieves some feces, typically from a stool bank."

Therefore, the closest match among the generated MCQs would be a question that involves the method of fecal transplant administration, which includes the source of the fecal transplant.

The closest match is: Question 7.

**Transcript**:
My wife grew up in Santa Rosa, California, and her best friend
was a woman named Joy Durand who lived on the northeast
outskirts of town. At midnight on the evening
of October 8, 2017, Joy's telephone rang. The voice said simply, "You must evacuate now. You don't have time to pack. Fire is coming." Joy gathered her parents
and her six-year-old son, and they hurried outside. The wildfire, which at that point
was just over the ridge from Joy's house, sounded like a jet engine
going at full throttle. The family got in their car, drove away, and within minutes,
their home had burned to the ground, incinerated by the blowtorch flames
of the Tubbs Fire. All night long, my wife got texts
and messages from friends and family, and while we didn’t know
the whole situation, it was clear that a disaster
was unfolding in her hometown. No one thought that fire could penetrate
so deeply into the city. But on that evening, 22 people lost their lives and over five thousand homes
and structures were destroyed. Wildfire is a large and growing challenge
to the West and to the world. What happened in Santa Rosa
is becoming all too common. Paradise in 2018, Australia in 2020,
Europe in 2022. And fire experts say that we should get ready
for more Santa Rosas because it's likely to get worse
before it gets better. Now beyond the major costs in lives and property and the economy, there's also a big
carbon impact to wildfire. In fact, the additional carbon
from California's 2020 wildfires was greater than the carbon that Californians had worked
so hard to save over the previous two decades. The largest fires are called megafires. These are the ones
that burn over 100,000 acres with the intensity that can threaten
aquifers and biodiversity, and even cause forest conversion, in which trees are so damaged
that they just don't grow back. These fires are getting worse as well. In fact, eight of the ten
largest megafires in California history have happened
over just the last five years. Many people feel overwhelmed
by this situation. I know I did. So two years ago,
working with great people, I closed a chapter
of my life in aerospace and I started a new journey to see if I could understand
the wildfire crisis better and what could be done about it. I started working with leaders
from firefighting and philanthropy, entrepreneurship,
science, tribal communities, and together we cofounded an organization
called Megafire Action, whose sole purpose
is to solve the megafire crisis. And I've come to believe
that if we take a holistic approach, we have an opportunity
to establish a new relationship with fire, to work safely with fire and potentially to solve
this wicked problem. The path forward has three solutions. The first is fire-adapted communities, the second is resilient landscapes and the third is
innovative fire management. So for the first,
fire-adapted communities, what we need to do is to clear the brush
and the vegetation from homes, from the immediate proximity of homes. Next, we need to
use fire-resistant materials in the homes and the roofs. And then the third thing
is to, where possible, protect against embers, flying embers, by protecting the home from openings
like your air vents and your chimneys. Now communities have
a strong shared interest to perform this work along
the exterior boundary of the community because it reduces the chance that fire will penetrate
deeply into the city, as it did in Santa Rosa. The second solution
is resilient landscapes. And if you take one lesson
from this talk, it's this. In order to solve the megafire crisis, we need to bring our western landscapes
back into a healthy balance by reducing the overgrown brush and trees
in the wildlands and the forest. Here we're finally starting
to take to heart the wisdom of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas who knew that fire was
a natural part of the landscape and who introduced low-intensity fire,
good fire, on a regular basis, at the right times. When this is done well, as around the communities
of South Lake Tahoe, then it can actually divert a megafire as bad as the one
that they experienced in 2021. It can also potentially prevent
a megafire from occurring, which is what some people think
happened in Napa of last year. But the scale of this challenge is huge. There are hundreds of millions of acres
of wildland in the American forests. The Forest Service
hopes to reduce the risk on 50 million high-priority acres
over the next ten years. But the challenge is that they're only
accomplishing a few million acres a year. And so we're not at the pace or scale that we need to do
to address this challenge. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing that we need to do is to essentially hire,
train and retain many more workers who will be doing the hard work
of defusing the time bombs inside our western forests. We need to pay them well. We need to support them
with full-time work and we need to protect them
from liability where necessary. The next thing we need to do
is to empower them with innovation. And right now there are
an incredible number of great companies and organizations that are working
to bring this innovation to reality. Just one of these companies
is called BurnBot, and what they're hoping to do is to make controlled burns
safer and faster. They're going to establish
a burned perimeter around an area with the remotely piloted rover and then they can bring a drone
into the middle of it, drop some fire into it
and burn that interior area safely. It's a brilliant but a simple idea. And I think we're going to need
a lot more of this kind of innovation if we're going to scale up
to the to the size of the problem that we have before us. Now the first two solutions
that I've talked to you about are pretty well agreed. The third one, innovative fire management,
is somewhat more controversial, but I think it offers huge potential
to address and solve the wildfire problem. What we need is innovation and technology
that can rapidly detect and assess fire and then quickly put it out
when it gets bad. And here, speed is paramount, because when you're
in the worst kind of fire days -- these are the hottest,
driest and windiest fire days -- if you can't bring fire management
resources to a fire very quickly, then it is likely that you
won't be able to contain that fire. Here we need to look at the example of the Quick Reaction Force
of Southern California, which is really designed
in some ways for these toughest days. The QRF is a public-private partnership, which now has three Chinook helicopters. These are the big ones
with the two rotors on the top. And each of them can drop
up to 3000 gallons of water on a fire, day or night, and they can do it very precisely. They can also refill
up to six times an hour so they can bring
a lot of mass to the problem. Over the course of two years
of demonstrations, the QRF has demonstrated
that this model has great potential, that, in fact, if you can bring
a lot of fire management resource to a fire very quickly, you can get on top of fires
before they get big and unmanageable. And this opens up
an exciting potential future. Imagine this model
with a series of larger drone vehicles distributed across the landscape
in higher-fire-risk areas. Imagine these vehicles
positioned periodically along utility lines or in areas of higher fire-risk
deep in the forest. Such a distributed network,
if connected to the right sensor system, could offer a future in which we are able
to really put out fires on the worst fire days,
and even in remote communities. Companies like Rain and Joby Aviation
are working on this vision today. The sensor system
will also be very important for the resolution of this problem. The system -- which will entail both ground-based,
aerial and space-based platforms -- won't be important just because
we're going to be able to see and detect fire where and when it pops up, but also because it'll enable us to differentiate
between good and bad fire, low-intensity fire
and high-intensity fire, which is very important because we need
more lower-intensity fire on the landscape to rejuvenate our forests, just as much as we need to know where and when fire risk
is becoming higher intensity. Fire is a prism through which
we can see the future of humanity's relationship
with natural systems. Working together
and supported by technology, we can build a world in which communities
are resilient to wildfire and in which forests
are brought back into a healthy balance. Ultimately, we can build a future, in which we don't just manage fire
to protect human life and property, but also to protect the biosphere
for global carbon emissions and for biodiversity. Ultimately, we need to become
the crew of Spaceship Earth. So let's get to work. Let's learn from fire and let's build a resilient,
sustainable future. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In the late 1700s, a German doctor named
Samuel Hahnemann began publishing articles about a new treatment
approach he called homeopathy. Hahnemann’s theory had
two central hypotheses. First, the treatment for an ailment
should be a dose of something that might cause that ailment. And second, diluted medicines are more
powerful than concentrated ones. So, a homeopathic remedy for insomnia might include an extremely diluted
solution of caffeine. Over the following 300 years, numerous physicians and patients
turned to homeopathy, and entire hospitals were built
to focus on homeopathic treatments. But despite all this, many studies have
shown that homeopathy has no therapeutic effect, and homeopathic treatments often
perform no better than placebos. So why do so many practitioners
and institutions still support this practice? The answer is that homeopathy
is a pseudoscience— a collection of theories, methods,
and assumptions that appear scientific,
but aren’t. In the worst cases, pseudoscience
practitioners encourage this confusion to exploit people. But even when they’re well-intentioned, pseudoscience still prevents people
from getting the help they need. So how are you supposed to tell what’s
science and what’s pseudoscience? This question is known as
the demarcation problem, and there's no easy answer. Part of the issue is that defining
science is surprisingly tricky. There's a common idea that all science
should, in some form or another, be related to testing
against empirical evidence. But some scientific activities
are primarily theoretical, and different disciplines
approach empiricism with varying goals, methodologies,
and standards. 20th century philosopher Karl Popper
tried to solve the demarcation problem with a simple rule. He argued that in order
for a theory to be scientific it must be falsifiable,
or able to be proven wrong. This requires a theory to make
specific predictions— for example, if you’re theorizing
that the Earth revolves around the Sun, you should be able to predict the path of
other celestial bodies in the night sky. This could then be disproven
based on whether or not your prediction corresponds
to your observations. Popper’s falsification criterion 
is a great way to identify pseudoscientific fields
like astrology, which makes overly broad predictions
that adapt to any observation. However, falsification alone doesn't
completely solve the demarcation issue. Many things we now consider science
were once untestable due to a lack of knowledge or technology. Fortunately, there are other factors
we can use to identify pseudoscience, including how a field responds
to criticism. Scientists should always be open
to the possibility that new observations could change
what they previously thought, and thoroughly disproven theories should
be rejected in favor of new explanations. Conversely, pseudoscientific theories are
often continually modified to explain away any contradictory results. This kind of behavior shows a resistance to what philosopher Helen Longino
calls transformative criticism. Pseudoscientific fields don't seek
to address their internal biases or meaningfully engage
in transparent peer review. Another key marker of science
is overall consistency. Science relies on a network
of shared information that ongoing research 
develops across disciplines. But pseudoscience often ignores
or denies this shared pool of data. For example, creationists claim
that animals didn’t evolve from a common ancestor, and that Earth is
less than 20,000 years old. But these claims contradict
huge amounts of evidence across multiple scientific disciplines, including geology, paleontology,
and biology. While the scientific method
is our most reliable tool to analyze empirical evidence
from the world around us, it certainly doesn't reveal everything
about the human condition. Faith-based beliefs can play an important
role in our lives and cultural traditions. But the reason it’s so important
to draw a line is that people often dress up
belief systems as science in efforts to manipulate others or undermine legitimate
scientific discoveries. And even in cases where this
might seem harmless, legitimizing pseudoscience can impede
genuine scientific progress. In a world where it's increasingly
difficult to tell fact from fiction, it's essential to keep your critical
thinking skills sharp. So the next time you hear
an amazing new claim, ask yourself: could we test this? Are the individuals behind this theory
updating their claims with new findings? Is this consistent with our broader
scientific understanding of the world? Because looking scientific
and actually being scientific are two very different things.

science and what’s pseudoscience? This question is known as
the demarcation problem, and there's no easy answer. Part of the issue is that defining
science is surprisingly tricky. There's a common idea that all science
should, in some form or another, be related to testing
against empirical evidence. But some scientific activities
are primarily theoretical, and different disciplines
approach empiricism with varying goals, methodologies,
and standards. 20th century philosopher Karl Popper
tried to solve the demarcation problem with a simple rule. He argued that in order
for a theory to be scientific it must be falsifiable,
or able to be proven wrong. This requires a theory to make
specific predictions— for example, if you’re theorizing
that the Earth revolves around the Sun, you should be able to predict the path of
other celestial bodies in the night sky. This could then be disproven
based on whether or not your prediction corresponds
to your observations. Popper’s falsification criterion 
is a great way to identify pseudoscientific fields
like astrology, which makes overly broad predictions
that adapt to any observation. However, falsification alone doesn't
completely solve the demarcation issue. Many things we now consider science
were once untestable due to a lack of knowledge or technology. Fortunately, there are other factors
we can use to identify pseudoscience, including how a field responds
to criticism. Scientists should always be open
to the possibility that new observations could change
what they previously thought, and thoroughly disproven theories should
be rejected in favor of new explanations. Conversely, pseudoscientific theories are
often continually modified to explain away any contradictory results. This kind of behavior shows a resistance to what philosopher Helen Longino
calls transformative criticism. Pseudoscientific fields don't seek
to address their internal biases or meaningfully engage
in transparent peer review. Another key marker of science
is overall consistency. Science relies on a network
of shared information that ongoing research 
develops across disciplines. But pseudoscience often ignores
or denies this shared pool of data. For example, creationists claim
that animals didn’t evolve from a common ancestor, and that Earth is
less than 20,000 years old. But these claims contradict
huge amounts of evidence across multiple scientific disciplines, including geology, paleontology,
and biology. While the scientific method
is our most reliable tool to analyze empirical evidence
from the world around us, it certainly doesn't reveal everything
about the human condition. Faith-based beliefs can play an important
role in our lives and cultural traditions. But the reason it’s so important
to draw a line is that people often dress up
belief systems as science in efforts to manipulate others or undermine legitimate
scientific discoveries. And even in cases where this
might seem harmless, legitimizing pseudoscience can impede
genuine scientific progress. In a world where it's increasingly
difficult to tell fact from fiction, it's essential to keep your critical
thinking skills sharp. So the next time you hear
an amazing new claim, ask yourself: could we test this? Are the individuals behind this theory
updating their claims with new findings? Is this consistent with our broader
scientific understanding of the world? Because looking scientific
and actually being scientific are two very different things.

**Transcript**:
In the late 1700s, a German doctor named
Samuel Hahnemann began publishing articles about a new treatment
approach he called homeopathy. Hahnemann’s theory had
two central hypotheses. First, the treatment for an ailment
should be a dose of something that might cause that ailment. And second, diluted medicines are more
powerful than concentrated ones. So, a homeopathic remedy for insomnia might include an extremely diluted
solution of caffeine. Over the following 300 years, numerous physicians and patients
turned to homeopathy, and entire hospitals were built
to focus on homeopathic treatments. But despite all this, many studies have
shown that homeopathy has no therapeutic effect, and homeopathic treatments often
perform no better than placebos. So why do so many practitioners
and institutions still support this practice? The answer is that homeopathy
is a pseudoscience— a collection of theories, methods,
and assumptions that appear scientific,
but aren’t. In the worst cases, pseudoscience
practitioners encourage this confusion to exploit people. But even when they’re well-intentioned, pseudoscience still prevents people

**Transcript**:
It's easy to imagine a world
without labor unions. We're essentially living
in that world now. And we are worse off as a result. Few of you probably belong to unions, but almost all of you benefit from them. It was unions that brought us the weekend. More importantly,
unions built the middle class by ensuring that workers
had the incomes to support families, to buy homes and cars, and to dream that their children
could do better than they could. It was union power and advocacy
that helped us win Social Security and health insurance
upon which almost all of us depend. In the 1950s, 33 percent of private-sector workers
belonged to unions. Big labor stood proudly
beside big business and big government. No more. Today, only six percent
of private sector workers are members of unions. With their decline in numbers came
a decline in political and economic power. And the result? A significant increase in inequality. A significant deterioration
in the possibility of a middle life -- A middle class lifestyle
for this generation or the next. And a receding chance to own
a home or afford retirement. We need unions to regain the power so that we can regain what we have lost, build a better future and help forge democracies that are built on a decent social contract
between citizens and government and among citizens themselves. Yes, we need unions today as much as ever. As a professor of political science, and someone who has studied
labor unions for a long time, I can tell you that one of the most
important things that unions do is to counterbalance
the power of corporations. They even the playing field. Yes, we need unions. But we need better and different unions that are more attuned to the 21st century. Let's picture the world before unions. Small children toiling all day
and even into the night in noisy, polluted factories. Or immigrant women workers
jumping from a burning sweatshop because the fire escapes were locked so that they could not take breaks. That was New York City in 1911, that's Bangladesh now. But unions changed that by winning protections for workers. They transformed lives. They enabled even the worst off
to achieve the American dream. Consider the longshore workers,
those who load and unload ships. In the morning, the boss came and yelled
all along the shore -- thus the name longshore. They pleaded for the scarce jobs, just as migrant day laborers do today
at places like Lowe's and Home Depot. It was humiliating, degrading. But when the unions won the right
to organize and won contracts, the wharf rats became lords of the dock. They became middle class. They could marry. They could support families, they could send their children to college, they had health insurance and benefits. They had dignity, respect. They were full American citizens. Unions enabled others
to attain the American dream by raising wages generally and by reducing wage disparities
between men and women and among the races. My research has shown me that with every transformation
in the economy, the technology, the way we work, there has been an evolution
in the labor movement. Craft unions, think construction work
or even beer making, emerged from medieval guilds. With the rise of industry --
auto, steel -- new forms of organization emerged. When white collar workers in offices,
in government, in health care in professions, won voice and representation, yet another kind of union developed. In my mind, in my ears, is Dolly Parton singing "9 to 5", inspired by a real-life
union of that name. When you hear that song, thank the unions for a decent working day. History shows that unions helped people
get dignity, rise out of poverty, inhibit workplace dangers and harassment and improve health
and well-being of us all. These are not yesterday's problems. Workers of today
still need and want unions. An MIT survey revealed that 50 percent
of the non-union workforce would join a union if given a chance. So, Margaret, if unions are so great, why are they in such serious decline? Because the odds are stacked against them. Many of you have read
about the Amazon warehouse workers who failed to win a union
representation election in Alabama. They failed because of concerted
employer opposition. Indeed, there are many
employers and politicians who are preventing
the reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy. These are laws that inhibit agriculture and domestic
workers from organizing, largely Black and brown workers. They make it hard for workers
in the gig economy to organize, those we call forth with our apps: rideshare, delivery service,
specialized tasks. There are employers and politicians
who are pushing states to pass “right-to-work” laws: laws that abolish the requirement that those who are covered by union
contracts have to pay union dues. This effectively kills the unions. Many workers in 27 states do not have to pay for the benefits
the unions provide for them. States that include Michigan,
Indiana and Wisconsin, former union strongholds. And society loses big. A recent study revealed
that in right-to-work law states, there is slower economic growth, higher consumer debt, lower wages, worse health outcomes
and lower civic participation than in states without such
laws on the books. But it's not just employers
and politicians that are holding unions back. Unions are a cause
of some of their own problems. Some unions are extremely bureaucratic, stifling debate and innovation. Some union leaders are corrupt. Rigging elections, paying themselves
humongous salaries, even when they represent
very low-income workers. And some commit felonies. Jimmy Hoffa is the notorious example
of a labor leader who went to prison. But just this year, several high-ranking officials
in the United Auto Workers were sentenced for embezzlement. Now, many critics, possibly some of you, blame unions for inflation. When wages go up, consumer prices go up. True enough, but so does the standard
of living for workers. And we as taxpayers benefit from higher standards
of living by workers. The pandemic gave us
the term "essential workers." If those in grocery, warehousing,
food processing, delivery, had strong unions,
indeed any unions at all, there would have been no need
for federal programs for those who have jobs to feed
their families and prevent evictions. Now there are many reasons
for union decline, including structural ones. The decline in union jobs
in manufacturing. But a major reason
is public lack of awareness, even misinformation
about the value of unions. Well before President Reagan fired the striking
air controllers in 1981, there has been concerted and continuous
opposition by employers and politicians to undermine unions. Employers no longer suppress unions by hiring private armies, like US Steel, Ford
and the coal companies did. Now they hire very high-priced
consulting firms to do that work. Elected officials may no longer
call out the police and the National Guard
to cart labor organizers off to jail. Now they pass legislation that restricts
union organizing and power. But workers are beginning to fight back as the headlines reveal. They are building solidarity
across racial, ethnic, religious, partisan divides. Martin Luther King [Jr.] exhorted us
to enwrap ourselves in a single garment of destiny. I have observed several unions
that I've studied build expanded and inclusive
communities of fate in which large numbers of others recognize that their destinies are entwined despite differences and distances. This doesn't always happen, but it can and it must. If you took my class,
or gave me another hour, I could give you numerous examples. We need as employees and citizens to build solidarity
through communities of fate that crosses geographies and differences. But to do that, we need to reimagine
labor unions for now. The labor movement must evolve
as it has in the past, even producing possibly alt unions,
alternatives to unions. Alternatives to traditional unions. Workers in gig professions, tech, don't necessarily want
a traditional union, but they do want influence
over their wages, working conditions and even the policies of their companies. And they are reimagining old approaches and coming up with new ones in order to build worker voice and power. Some are reconfiguring
worker cooperatives: employee-owned businesses, in which the workers determine wages, working conditions and distribution of profits. This is not a pipe dream. Mondragon in Spain
has over 80,000 employee owners, takes in over 13 billion dollars a year and redistributes its profits
to build worker skills and capacities among its member cooperatives. A newer approach is to use
platform technologies to teach workers their rights. In our global, hyperconnected
and socially isolating world, platforms such as coworker.org or Unit recognize and address the fact
that there is a mobile workforce that no longer has
water coolers or lunch rooms around which to gather and strategize. These platforms provide workers
with a way to share experiences, access organizing resources and build networks at scale
across geographies and employers. Coworker.org had a huge win with Alphabet, the parent company of Google, a giant among tech firms. Alphabet workers recognize
that they are part of a community of fate that crosses large distances. They have been protesting
Google's contracts with the Pentagon and with immigration authorities. They have normal run-of-the-mill
economic union demands, but they also have the political demand that they should have a say
over company policies that affect them and us. Now, whatever you thought
of unions in the past, I hope -- I hope that these examples
have revealed to you what they can be today and for tomorrow. Unions once significantly reduced
income inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor. They can again. These graph lines came together
when unions rose. I'd like to see those lines
permanently converge and inequality reduced once and for all. Billionaires are building
rockets to explore outer space. This is so exciting, but equally exciting are the workers who are providing
the goods and services on which those billionaires
[and] we all depend, exploring new ways
to gain power and voice. If even some of these
explorations succeed, workers will gain dignity, economic security and the power to challenge
employers and politicians. The result? The resuscitation of the middle class and a far more equitable society. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
It's easy to imagine a world
without labor unions. We're essentially living
in that world now. And we are worse off as a result. Few of you probably belong to unions, but almost all of you benefit from them. It was unions that brought us the weekend. More importantly,
unions built the middle class by ensuring that workers
had the incomes to support families, to buy homes and cars, and to dream that their children
could do better than they could. It was union power and advocacy
that helped us win Social Security and health insurance
upon which almost all of us depend. In the 1950s, 33 percent of private-sector workers
belonged to unions. Big labor stood proudly
beside big business and big government. No more. Today, only six percent
of private sector workers are members of unions. With their decline in numbers came
a decline in political and economic power. And the result? A significant increase in inequality. A significant deterioration
in the possibility of a middle life -- A middle class lifestyle
for this generation or the next. And a receding chance to own
a home or afford retirement. We need unions to regain the power so that we can regain what we have lost, build a better future and help forge democracies that are built on a decent social contract
between citizens and government and among citizens themselves. Yes, we need unions today as much as ever. As a professor of political science, and someone who has studied
labor unions for a long time, I can tell you that one of the most
important things that unions do is to counterbalance
the power of corporations. They even the playing field. Yes, we need unions. But we need better and different unions that are more attuned to the 21st century. Let's picture the world before unions. Small children toiling all day
and even into the night in noisy, polluted factories. Or immigrant women workers
jumping from a burning sweatshop because the fire escapes were locked so that they could not take breaks. That was New York City in 1911, that's Bangladesh now. But unions changed that by winning protections for workers. They transformed lives. They enabled even the worst off
to achieve the American dream. Consider the longshore workers,
those who load and unload ships. In the morning, the boss came and yelled
all along the shore -- thus the name longshore. They pleaded for the scarce jobs, just as migrant day laborers do today
at places like Lowe's and Home Depot. It was humiliating, degrading. But when the unions won the right
to organize and won contracts, the wharf rats became lords of the dock. They became middle class. They could marry. They could support families, they could send their children to college, they had health insurance and benefits. They had dignity, respect. They were full American citizens. Unions enabled others
to attain the American dream by raising wages generally and by reducing wage disparities
between men and women and among the races. My research has shown me that with every transformation
in the economy, the technology, the way we work, there has been an evolution
in the labor movement. Craft unions, think construction work
or even beer making, emerged from medieval guilds. With the rise of industry --
auto, steel -- new forms of organization emerged. When white collar workers in offices,
in government, in health care in professions, won voice and representation, yet another kind of union developed. In my mind, in my ears, is Dolly Parton singing "9 to 5", inspired by a real-life
union of that name. When you hear that song, thank the unions for a decent working day. History shows that unions helped people
get dignity, rise out of poverty, inhibit workplace dangers and harassment and improve health
and well-being of us all. These are not yesterday's problems. Workers of today
still need and want unions. An MIT survey revealed that 50 percent
of the non-union workforce would join a union if given a chance. So, Margaret, if unions are so great, why are they in such serious decline? Because the odds are stacked against them. Many of you have read
about the Amazon warehouse workers who failed to win a union
representation election in Alabama. They failed because of concerted
employer opposition. Indeed, there are many
employers and politicians who are preventing
the reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy. These are laws that inhibit agriculture and domestic
workers from organizing, largely Black and brown workers. They make it hard for workers
in the gig economy to organize, those we call forth with our apps: rideshare, delivery service,
specialized tasks. There are employers and politicians
who are pushing states to pass “right-to-work” laws: laws that abolish the requirement that those who are covered by union
contracts have to pay union dues. This effectively kills the unions. Many workers in 27 states do not have to pay for the benefits
the unions provide for them. States that include Michigan,
Indiana and Wisconsin, former union strongholds. And society loses big. A recent study revealed
that in right-to-work law states, there is slower economic growth, higher consumer debt, lower wages, worse health outcomes
and lower civic participation than in states without such
laws on the books. But it's not just employers
and politicians that are holding unions back. Unions are a cause
of some of their own problems. Some unions are extremely bureaucratic, stifling debate and innovation. Some union leaders are corrupt. Rigging elections, paying themselves
humongous salaries, even when they represent
very low-income workers. And some commit felonies. Jimmy Hoffa is the notorious example
of a labor leader who went to prison. But just this year, several high-ranking officials
in the United Auto Workers were sentenced for embezzlement. Now, many critics, possibly some of you, blame unions for inflation. When wages go up, consumer prices go up. True enough, but so does the standard
of living for workers. And we as taxpayers benefit from higher standards
of living by workers. The pandemic gave us
the term "essential workers." If those in grocery, warehousing,
food processing, delivery, had strong unions,
indeed any unions at all, there would have been no need
for federal programs for those who have jobs to feed
their families and prevent evictions. Now there are many reasons
for union decline, including structural ones. The decline in union jobs
in manufacturing. But a major reason
is public lack of awareness, even misinformation
about the value of unions. Well before President Reagan fired the striking
air controllers in 1981, there has been concerted and continuous
opposition by employers and politicians to undermine unions. Employers no longer suppress unions by hiring private armies, like US Steel, Ford
and the coal companies did. Now they hire very high-priced
consulting firms to do that work. Elected officials may no longer
call out the police and the National Guard
to cart labor organizers off to jail. Now they pass legislation that restricts
union organizing and power. But workers are beginning to fight back as the headlines reveal. They are building solidarity
across racial, ethnic, religious, partisan divides. Martin Luther King [Jr.] exhorted us
to enwrap ourselves in a single garment of destiny. I have observed several unions
that I've studied build expanded and inclusive
communities of fate in which large numbers of others recognize that their destinies are entwined despite differences and distances. This doesn't always happen, but it can and it must. If you took my class,
or gave me another hour, I could give you numerous examples. We need as employees and citizens to build solidarity
through communities of fate that crosses geographies and differences. But to do that, we need to reimagine
labor unions for now. The labor movement must evolve
as it has in the past, even producing possibly alt unions,
alternatives to unions. Alternatives to traditional unions. Workers in gig professions, tech, don't necessarily want
a traditional union, but they do want influence
over their wages, working conditions and even the policies of their companies. And they are reimagining old approaches and coming up with new ones in order to build worker voice and power. Some are reconfiguring
worker cooperatives: employee-owned businesses, in which the workers determine wages, working conditions and distribution of profits. This is not a pipe dream. Mondragon in Spain
has over 80,000 employee owners, takes in over 13 billion dollars a year and redistributes its profits
to build worker skills and capacities among its member cooperatives. A newer approach is to use
platform technologies to teach workers their rights. In our global, hyperconnected
and socially isolating world, platforms such as coworker.org or Unit recognize and address the fact
that there is a mobile workforce that no longer has
water coolers or lunch rooms around which to gather and strategize. These platforms provide workers
with a way to share experiences, access organizing resources and build networks at scale
across geographies and employers. Coworker.org had a huge win with Alphabet, the parent company of Google, a giant among tech firms. Alphabet workers recognize
that they are part of a community of fate that crosses large distances. They have been protesting
Google's contracts with the Pentagon and with immigration authorities. They have normal run-of-the-mill
economic union demands, but they also have the political demand that they should have a say
over company policies that affect them and us. Now, whatever you thought
of unions in the past, I hope -- I hope that these examples
have revealed to you what they can be today and for tomorrow. Unions once significantly reduced
income inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor. They can again. These graph lines came together
when unions rose. I'd like to see those lines
permanently converge and inequality reduced once and for all. Billionaires are building
rockets to explore outer space. This is so exciting, but equally exciting are the workers who are providing
the goods and services on which those billionaires
[and] we all depend, exploring new ways
to gain power and voice. If even some of these
explorations succeed, workers will gain dignity, economic security and the power to challenge
employers and politicians. The result? The resuscitation of the middle class and a far more equitable society. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
At dawn on July 29th, 1364,
John Hawkwood— an English soldier turned
contract mercenary— led a surprise attack against an army
of sleeping Florentine mercenaries. The enemy commander quickly awoke 
and gathered his men to launch a counterattack. But as soon as the defending army
was ready to fight, Hawkwood’s fighters simply turned
and walked away. This wasn't an act of cowardice. These mercenaries, known as condottieri, had simply done just enough fighting
to fulfill their contracts. And for Italy’s condottieri,
war wasn’t about glory or conquest: it was purely about getting paid. For much of the 14th and 15th centuries,
the condottieri dominated Italian warfare, profiting from— and encouraging—
the region’s intense political rivalries. The most powerful of these regions were
ruled either by wealthy representatives of the Catholic Church or merchants who’d grown rich
from international trade. These rulers competed
for power and prestige by working to attract the most talented
artists and thinkers to their courts, leading to a cultural explosion
now known as the Italian Renaissance. But local rivalries also played 
out in military conflicts, fought almost entirely by the condottieri. Many of these elite mercenaries were
veterans of the Hundred Years’ War, hailing from France and England. When that war reached
a temporary truce in 1360, some soldiers began pillaging
France in search of fortune. And the riches they found 
in Catholic churches drew their raiding parties to the center
of the Church’s operations: Italy. But here, savvy ruling merchants
saw these bandits’ arrival as a golden opportunity. By hiring the soldiers as mercenaries, they could control the violence
and gain an experienced army without the cost of outfitting
and training locals. The mercenaries liked this deal as well,
as it offered regular income and the ability to play these rulers
off each other for their own benefit. Of course, these soldiers had
to be kept on a tight leash. Rulers forced them to sign
elaborate contracts, or condotta, a word that became synonymous
with the mercenaries themselves. Divisions of payment, distribution
of plunder, non-compete agreements— it was all spelled out clearly, making war merely another
dimension of business. Contracts specified the number of men
a commander would provide, and the resulting armies ranged
from a few hundred to several thousand. Individual soldiers regularly moved
between armies in search of higher payments. And when their contracts expired, condottieri commanders became free agents
with no expectation of ongoing loyalty. When John Hawkwood launched his
surprise attack against the Florentine condottieri, he was working for Pisa. Later, he would fight for Florence
and many of Pisa’s other enemies. But regardless of who was
contracting them, the condottieri fought primarily
for themselves. Their extensive military experience
allowed them to avoid taking unnecessary risks
in the heat of battle. And— while still deadly— their clashes
rarely led to crushing victories or defeats. Condottieri commanders wanted battles
to be inconclusive— after all, if they established peace,
they’d put themselves out of business. So even when one side did win, enemy combatants were typically held
hostage and released to fight another day. But there was nothing merciful
about these decisions. Contracts could just as easily turn them
into ruthless killers, as in 1377, when Hawkwood led the massacre
of a famine-stricken town who’d tried to revolt
against the local government. Over time, foreign condottieri were
increasingly replaced by native Italians. For young men from humble origins, war-for-profit offered an attractive
alternative to farming or the church. And this new generation of condottieri
leveraged their military power into political influence, in some cases even founding
ruling dynasties. However, despite cornering the market on
Italian warfare for nearly two centuries, the condottieri only truly excelled
at engaging in just enough close-range combat 
to fulfill their contracts. Over time, they became outclassed
by the gunpowder weaponry of France and Spain’s
large standing armies, as well as the naval might
of the Ottomans. By the mid 16th century, these state-sponsored militaries forced
all of Europe into a new era of warfare, putting an end to the condottieri’s
conniving war games.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Who were the condottieri?
Options: A. Italian soldiers who went on Crusade, B. Soldiers who guarded the Pope, C. Bureaucrats within Italian city-states, D. Contract mercenary soldiers
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What was the primary motivation for Italy's condottieri to engage in warfare?

**Transcript**:
At dawn on July 29th, 1364,
John Hawkwood— an English soldier turned
contract mercenary— led a surprise attack against an army
of sleeping Florentine mercenaries. The enemy commander quickly awoke 
and gathered his men to launch a counterattack. But as soon as the defending army
was ready to fight, Hawkwood’s fighters simply turned
and walked away. This wasn't an act of cowardice. These mercenaries, known as condottieri, had simply done just enough fighting
to fulfill their contracts. And for Italy’s condottieri,
war wasn’t about glory or conquest: it was purely about getting paid. For much of the 14th and 15th centuries,
the condottieri dominated Italian warfare, profiting from— and encouraging—
the region’s intense political rivalries. The most powerful of these regions were
ruled either by wealthy representatives of the Catholic Church or merchants who’d grown rich
from international trade. These rulers competed
for power and prestige by working to attract the most talented
artists and thinkers to their courts, leading to a cultural explosion
now known as the Italian Renaissance. But local rivalries also played 
out in military conflicts, fought almost entirely by the condottieri. Many of these elite mercenaries were
veterans of the Hundred Years’ War, hailing from France and England. When that war reached
a temporary truce in 1360, some soldiers began pillaging
France in search of fortune. And the riches they found 
in Catholic churches drew their raiding parties to the center
of the Church’s operations: Italy. But here, savvy ruling merchants
saw these bandits’ arrival as a golden opportunity. By hiring the soldiers as mercenaries, they could control the violence
and gain an experienced army without the cost of outfitting
and training locals. The mercenaries liked this deal as well,
as it offered regular income and the ability to play these rulers
off each other for their own benefit. Of course, these soldiers had
to be kept on a tight leash. Rulers forced them to sign
elaborate contracts, or condotta, a word that became synonymous
with the mercenaries themselves. Divisions of payment, distribution
of plunder, non-compete agreements— it was all spelled out clearly, making war merely another
dimension of business. Contracts specified the number of men
a commander would provide, and the resulting armies ranged
from a few hundred to several thousand. Individual soldiers regularly moved
between armies in search of higher payments. And when their contracts expired, condottieri commanders became free agents
with no expectation of ongoing loyalty. When John Hawkwood launched his
surprise attack against the Florentine condottieri, he was working for Pisa. Later, he would fight for Florence
and many of Pisa’s other enemies. But regardless of who was
contracting them, the condottieri fought primarily
for themselves. Their extensive military experience
allowed them to avoid taking unnecessary risks
in the heat of battle. And— while still deadly— their clashes
rarely led to crushing victories or defeats. Condottieri commanders wanted battles
to be inconclusive— after all, if they established peace,
they’d put themselves out of business. So even when one side did win, enemy combatants were typically held
hostage and released to fight another day. But there was nothing merciful
about these decisions. Contracts could just as easily turn them
into ruthless killers, as in 1377, when Hawkwood led the massacre
of a famine-stricken town who’d tried to revolt
against the local government. Over time, foreign condottieri were
increasingly replaced by native Italians. For young men from humble origins, war-for-profit offered an attractive
alternative to farming or the church. And this new generation of condottieri
leveraged their military power into political influence, in some cases even founding
ruling dynasties. However, despite cornering the market on
Italian warfare for nearly two centuries, the condottieri only truly excelled
at engaging in just enough close-range combat 
to fulfill their contracts. Over time, they became outclassed
by the gunpowder weaponry of France and Spain’s
large standing armies, as well as the naval might
of the Ottomans. By the mid 16th century, these state-sponsored militaries forced
all of Europe into a new era of warfare, putting an end to the condottieri’s
conniving war games.

**Transcript**:
From the 1650s through the late 1800s, European colonists descended
on South Africa. First, Dutch and later British forces
sought to claim the region for themselves, with their struggle becoming
even more aggressive after discovering the area’s
abundant natural resources. In their ruthless scramble, both colonial powers violently removed
numerous Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Yet despite these conflicts, the colonizers often claimed
they were settling in empty land devoid of local people. These reports were corroborated
in letters and travelogues by various administrators,
soldiers, and missionaries. Maps were drawn reflecting these claims, and prominent British historians
supported this narrative. Publications codifying the so-called
Empty Land Theory had three central arguments. First, most of the land
being settled by Europeans had no established communities
or agricultural infrastructure. Second, any African communities
that were in those regions had actually entered the area
at the same time as Europeans, so they didn’t have an ancestral claim
to the land. And third, since these African communities
had probably stolen the land from earlier, 
no-longer-present Indigenous people, the Europeans were within their rights
to displace these African settlers. The problem is that all three of these
arguments were completely false. Almost none of this land was empty
and Africans had lived here for millennia. Indigenous South Africans
simply had a different practice of land ownership 
from the Dutch and British. Land belonged to families or groups,
not individuals. And even that ownership
was more focused on the land’s agricultural products
than the land itself. Community leaders would distribute
seasonal land rights, allowing various nomadic groups
to graze cattle or forage for vegetation. Even the groups that did live
in large agricultural settlements didn’t believe they owned the land
as private property. But the colonizing Europeans had
no respect for this system of ownership. They concluded the land
belonged to no one and could therefore be divided
amongst themselves. In this context, claims that
the land was “empty” were an ignorant oversimplification
of a much more complex reality. But the Empty Land Theory allowed
British academics to rewrite history and minimize native populations. In 1894, the European parliament
in Cape Town took this exploitation even further
by passing the Glen Grey Act. This decree made it
functionally impossible for native Africans to own land, shattering the system of collective
tribal ownership and creating a class of landless people. To justify the theft, Europeans painted
the locals as barbarians who lacked the capacity for reason and were better off being ruled
by the colonizers. This strategy of stripping locals
of their right to ancestral lands and casting native people as savages has
been employed by many colonizers. Now known as the Empty Land Myth, this is a well-established technique
in the colonial playbook, and its impact can be found 
in the history of many countries, including Australia, Canada,
and the United States. And in South Africa, the influence 
of this narrative can be traced directly to a brutal campaign
of institutionalized racism. Barred from their lands, the once self-sufficient population
struggled as migrant laborers and miners on European-owned property. The law forbade them from working
certain skilled jobs, and forced Africans to live
in racially segregated areas. Over time,
these racist policies intensified, mandating separation in urban areas, restricting voting rights,
and eventually building to apartheid. Under this system,
African people had no voting rights, and the education of native Africans 
was overhauled to emphasize their legal and social
subservience to white settlers. This state of legally enforced racism
persisted through the early 1990s, and throughout this period, colonists frequently invoked
the Empty Land Theory to justify the unequal distribution
of land. South African resistance movements
fought throughout the 20th century to gain political and economic freedom. And since the 1980s, South African
scholars have been using archaeological evidence
to correct the historical record. Today, South African schools are finally
teaching the region's true history. But the legacy of the Empty Land Myth
still persists as one of the most harmful stories
ever told.

**Transcript**:
From the 1650s through the late 1800s, European colonists descended
on South Africa. First, Dutch and later British forces
sought to claim the region for themselves, with their struggle becoming
even more aggressive after discovering the area’s
abundant natural resources. In their ruthless scramble, both colonial powers violently removed
numerous Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Yet despite these conflicts, the colonizers often claimed
they were settling in empty land devoid of local people. These reports were corroborated
in letters and travelogues by various administrators,
soldiers, and missionaries. Maps were drawn reflecting these claims, and prominent British historians
supported this narrative. Publications codifying the so-called
Empty Land Theory had three central arguments. First, most of the land
being settled by Europeans had no established communities
or agricultural infrastructure. Second, any African communities
that were in those regions had actually entered the area
at the same time as Europeans, so they didn’t have an ancestral claim
to the land. And third, since these African communities
had probably stolen the land from earlier, 
no-longer-present Indigenous people, the Europeans were within their rights
to displace these African settlers. The problem is that all three of these
arguments were completely false. Almost none of this land was empty
and Africans had lived here for millennia. Indigenous South Africans
simply had a different practice of land ownership 
from the Dutch and British. Land belonged to families or groups,
not individuals. And even that ownership
was more focused on the land’s agricultural products
than the land itself. Community leaders would distribute
seasonal land rights, allowing various nomadic groups
to graze cattle or forage for vegetation. Even the groups that did live
in large agricultural settlements didn’t believe they owned the land
as private property. But the colonizing Europeans had
no respect for this system of ownership. They concluded the land
belonged to no one and could therefore be divided
amongst themselves. In this context, claims that
the land was “empty” were an ignorant oversimplification
of a much more complex reality. But the Empty Land Theory allowed
British academics to rewrite history and minimize native populations. In 1894, the European parliament
in Cape Town took this exploitation even further
by passing the Glen Grey Act. This decree made it
functionally impossible for native Africans to own land, shattering the system of collective
tribal ownership and creating a class of landless people. To justify the theft, Europeans painted
the locals as barbarians who lacked the capacity for reason and were better off being ruled
by the colonizers. This strategy of stripping locals
of their right to ancestral lands and casting native people as savages has
been employed by many colonizers. Now known as the Empty Land Myth, this is a well-established technique
in the colonial playbook, and its impact can be found 
in the history of many countries, including Australia, Canada,
and the United States. And in South Africa, the influence 
of this narrative can be traced directly to a brutal campaign
of institutionalized racism. Barred from their lands, the once self-sufficient population
struggled as migrant laborers and miners on European-owned property. The law forbade them from working
certain skilled jobs, and forced Africans to live
in racially segregated areas. Over time,
these racist policies intensified, mandating separation in urban areas, restricting voting rights,
and eventually building to apartheid. Under this system,
African people had no voting rights, and the education of native Africans 
was overhauled to emphasize their legal and social
subservience to white settlers. This state of legally enforced racism
persisted through the early 1990s, and throughout this period, colonists frequently invoked
the Empty Land Theory to justify the unequal distribution
of land. South African resistance movements
fought throughout the 20th century to gain political and economic freedom. And since the 1980s, South African
scholars have been using archaeological evidence
to correct the historical record. Today, South African schools are finally
teaching the region's true history. But the legacy of the Empty Land Myth
still persists as one of the most harmful stories
ever told.

**Transcript**:
In 2018, an orca called
Tahlequah gave birth. But her daughter died within an hour. Tahlequah, however, didn’t leave her body. And over the next 17 days 
and 1,600 kilometers, she kept it afloat atop her own, diving to retrieve the body 
whenever it slipped away, even after it began deteriorating. By altering her feeding 
and travel patterns, Tahlequah’s behavior
was certainly unusual. But was she mourning— or just confused? Do non-human animals grieve? This question is tricky. In 1871, Charles Darwin argued
that other animals experience a wide range of emotions,
including grief. But, especially in the absence 
of a dependable bridge between our minds and theirs, many scientists have long been wary of projecting human emotions
onto other animals. It’s also been thought that they might
display irregular behaviors after a death for other adaptive reasons. And, for a while, the paradigm was
that humans were exceptional: other animals were reacting and surviving, while we alone were thinking and feeling. This conception was increasingly
challenged during the 20th century. In 1985, for example, 
a gorilla called Koko, who'd been trained to use some signs
from American Sign Language, was told that her kitten
companion had died. She made distress calls,
and several weeks later, looking at a photo of another kitten
signed “cry,” “sad,” and “frown.” Now there’s a growing pool
of data and observations suggesting that some animals,
including mammals and birds, might experience what we call grief. In 2003, Eleanor, 
an elephant matriarch, collapsed. Within minutes, another matriarch called
Grace neared and helped Eleanor stand, only for her to fall again. Grace vocalized, stayed by Eleanor’s side,
and tried pushing her back up. When Eleanor died,
a female named Maui approached, positioned herself over Eleanor’s body,
and rocked back and forth. Over the course of one week, elephants from five different families
visited Eleanor’s body. On separate occasions, elephants have been observed carrying
the remains of family members, including jawbones and tusks. In 2010, a giraffe was born with a
deformed foot and had trouble walking. The calf lived just four weeks. On the day the calf died,
22 other females and four juveniles closely attended and occasionally
nuzzled the body. On the third morning, the mother
was alone and still not eating, which giraffes usually do constantly. Instead, she stayed by her dead calf,
even after hyenas ate away at the body. Scientists have also begun quantitatively
assessing other animals’ responses to death. In 2006, researchers analyzed
baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids, stress hormones that spike
when humans are bereaved. They compared the samples from females
who had lost a close relative in a predator attack 
with those who hadn’t. And they found that the glucocorticoid
levels of baboons who had were significantly higher the month
following the death. Those baboons then increased
their grooming behavior and the number of their grooming partners, broadening and strengthening
their social networks. Within two months, their glucocorticoid
levels returned to the baseline. Researchers have also observed primate
mothers engaging in apparently contradictory behaviors while carrying
their dead children. Like switching between cannibalizing
or dragging their child’s corpse and carefully carrying or grooming it, suggesting that the mothers were
experiencing conflicting impulses towards the bodies. Our current understanding 
of the emotional landscapes of other animals is severely limited. To get a better grasp on mourning
in the animal kingdom, we need a lot more research. But where does this leave us for now? Conversations around whether non-human
animals experience emotions, like grief, can be emotional, in part because their outcomes
have very real implications— like determining if orcas should be
isolated and kept in captivity, or whether dairy cows should be separated
from their newborn calves. Until we do have more data on the subject, should we treat non-human animals like
they may have the capacity to grieve? Or assume they don’t? Which belief could cause more harm?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2018, an orca called
Tahlequah gave birth. But her daughter died within an hour. Tahlequah, however, didn’t leave her body. And over the next 17 days 
and 1,600 kilometers, she kept it afloat atop her own, diving to retrieve the body 
whenever it slipped away, even after it began deteriorating. By altering her feeding 
and travel patterns, Tahlequah’s behavior
was certainly unusual. But was she mourning— or just confused? Do non-human animals grieve? This question is tricky. In 1871, Charles Darwin argued
that other animals experience a wide range of emotions,
including grief. But, especially in the absence 
of a dependable bridge between our minds and theirs, many scientists have long been wary of projecting human emotions
onto other animals. It’s also been thought that they might
display irregular behaviors after a death for other adaptive reasons. And, for a while, the paradigm was
that humans were exceptional: other animals were reacting and surviving, while we alone were thinking and feeling. This conception was increasingly
challenged during the 20th century. In 1985, for example, 
a gorilla called Koko, who'd been trained to use some signs
from American Sign Language, was told that her kitten
companion had died. She made distress calls,
and several weeks later, looking at a photo of another kitten
signed “cry,” “sad,” and “frown.” Now there’s a growing pool
of data and observations suggesting that some animals,
including mammals and birds, might experience what we call grief. In 2003, Eleanor, 
an elephant matriarch, collapsed. Within minutes, another matriarch called
Grace neared and helped Eleanor stand, only for her to fall again. Grace vocalized, stayed by Eleanor’s side,
and tried pushing her back up. When Eleanor died,
a female named Maui approached, positioned herself over Eleanor’s body,
and rocked back and forth. Over the course of one week, elephants from five different families
visited Eleanor’s body. On separate occasions, elephants have been observed carrying
the remains of family members, including jawbones and tusks. In 2010, a giraffe was born with a
deformed foot and had trouble walking. The calf lived just four weeks. On the day the calf died,
22 other females and four juveniles closely attended and occasionally
nuzzled the body. On the third morning, the mother
was alone and still not eating, which giraffes usually do constantly. Instead, she stayed by her dead calf,
even after hyenas ate away at the body. Scientists have also begun quantitatively
assessing other animals’ responses to death. In 2006, researchers analyzed
baboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids, stress hormones that spike
when humans are bereaved. They compared the samples from females
who had lost a close relative in a predator attack 
with those who hadn’t. And they found that the glucocorticoid
levels of baboons who had were significantly higher the month
following the death. Those baboons then increased
their grooming behavior and the number of their grooming partners, broadening and strengthening
their social networks. Within two months, their glucocorticoid
levels returned to the baseline. Researchers have also observed primate
mothers engaging in apparently contradictory behaviors while carrying
their dead children. Like switching between cannibalizing
or dragging their child’s corpse and carefully carrying or grooming it, suggesting that the mothers were
experiencing conflicting impulses towards the bodies. Our current understanding 
of the emotional landscapes of other animals is severely limited. To get a better grasp on mourning
in the animal kingdom, we need a lot more research. But where does this leave us for now? Conversations around whether non-human
animals experience emotions, like grief, can be emotional, in part because their outcomes
have very real implications— like determining if orcas should be
isolated and kept in captivity, or whether dairy cows should be separated
from their newborn calves. Until we do have more data on the subject, should we treat non-human animals like
they may have the capacity to grieve? Or assume they don’t? Which belief could cause more harm?

**Transcript**:
Your time traveling has caused a few
issues with the space-time continuum, like your old high school bully, Riff,
now ruling the future with an iron fist. You and the professor have driven
your hovering DeLorean back to the past to undo your own meddling. But shortly after you fix your mistakes, another DeLorean appears
and crashes into yours. Out step older versions
of you and the professor, who apparently had the same idea
from somewhere else in the timeline. The professors panic and explain
that the universe could collapse now that you’re both 
in the same time and place. The only hope is to merge the time streams
by having each version of you simultaneously time travel home. You both have plenty of fuel, but the crash broke your
chrono-stabilizing gyroscopes and your cars can only time travel
under very specific circumstances. Each of you will need to drive
a mile south, then a mile east, and then a mile north to get
the gyroscopes into temporal alignment. That would be easy, except each calibration requires placing
a portable time gate at your starting point, then driving into it at the precise end of
your three mile drive without it moving. Not only that, but your two time gates
must be placed at least 100 miles apart so their signals don’t interfere. In other words, you need to find two
different locations where you can drive a mile south, a mile east,
and then a mile north and end up exactly where you started. The professors are about to show you where
you can do this when they vanish, becoming victims 
of the collapsing timeline. It’s up to you now: where can you place the time gates? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If the earth were flat, there would
be no way to solve this riddle. What you need is some way to use the
sphericalness of the planet, some of its notable features, and the fact that lines of latitude aren’t
really lines— they’re circles. The equator is the biggest of these
circles, but it doesn’t do much for you, and you can’t even go south
from the South Pole. But let's try the North Pole. When you go a mile south, you'll be
on a circle that runs east west. After a mile east, you’re still
on that same circle, so the final mile north brings you 
back to your starting point. Perfect. That’s one gate down, but where
should you place the second? Well, the nice thing about circles is
that if you travel on them far enough, you come back to where you started. If there were a circle that had
a circumference of one mile, that would work marvelously. You could drive south a mile to reach it,
make the one mile rotation east, then go north a mile to return
to where you started. Such a circle does exist just
north of the South Pole. To find your starting point, you can use the standard formula
for the circumference of a circle. If you wanted to be absolutely precise, you could use an equation
that takes into account the roughly spherical shape of the Earth. But an area this small is
so close to being flat that the standard formula gives a solution
within a fraction of an inch of the actual distance. A circle with a one mile circumference has
a radius of just under 0.16 miles, so any point on the circle 
one mile north of that will be suitable for your time gate. In fact, there are other answers too: start a little further south, and you could travel east around the
Earth twice, three times, or more! In theory, there are infinite
possible starting points, but the circles get so tight that they
aren't actually practical to drive. Everything’s getting a little weird by the time you reach 
your starting points. You drop the time gates,
sync up with your doppelgänger, and slam down the pedal. You both reach 88mph just as you complete
your three mile circuits, merge the timelines,
and save the universe.

**Transcript**:
Your time traveling has caused a few
issues with the space-time continuum, like your old high school bully, Riff,
now ruling the future with an iron fist. You and the professor have driven
your hovering DeLorean back to the past to undo your own meddling. But shortly after you fix your mistakes, another DeLorean appears
and crashes into yours. Out step older versions
of you and the professor, who apparently had the same idea
from somewhere else in the timeline. The professors panic and explain
that the universe could collapse now that you’re both 
in the same time and place. The only hope is to merge the time streams
by having each version of you simultaneously time travel home. You both have plenty of fuel, but the crash broke your
chrono-stabilizing gyroscopes and your cars can only time travel
under very specific circumstances. Each of you will need to drive
a mile south, then a mile east, and then a mile north to get
the gyroscopes into temporal alignment. That would be easy, except each calibration requires placing
a portable time gate at your starting point, then driving into it at the precise end of
your three mile drive without it moving. Not only that, but your two time gates
must be placed at least 100 miles apart so their signals don’t interfere. In other words, you need to find two
different locations where you can drive a mile south, a mile east,
and then a mile north and end up exactly where you started. The professors are about to show you where
you can do this when they vanish, becoming victims 
of the collapsing timeline. It’s up to you now: where can you place the time gates? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If the earth were flat, there would
be no way to solve this riddle. What you need is some way to use the
sphericalness of the planet, some of its notable features, and the fact that lines of latitude aren’t
really lines— they’re circles. The equator is the biggest of these
circles, but it doesn’t do much for you, and you can’t even go south
from the South Pole. But let's try the North Pole. When you go a mile south, you'll be
on a circle that runs east west. After a mile east, you’re still
on that same circle, so the final mile north brings you 
back to your starting point. Perfect. That’s one gate down, but where
should you place the second? Well, the nice thing about circles is
that if you travel on them far enough, you come back to where you started. If there were a circle that had
a circumference of one mile, that would work marvelously. You could drive south a mile to reach it,
make the one mile rotation east, then go north a mile to return
to where you started. Such a circle does exist just
north of the South Pole. To find your starting point, you can use the standard formula
for the circumference of a circle. If you wanted to be absolutely precise, you could use an equation
that takes into account the roughly spherical shape of the Earth. But an area this small is
so close to being flat that the standard formula gives a solution
within a fraction of an inch of the actual distance. A circle with a one mile circumference has
a radius of just under 0.16 miles, so any point on the circle 
one mile north of that will be suitable for your time gate. In fact, there are other answers too: start a little further south, and you could travel east around the
Earth twice, three times, or more! In theory, there are infinite
possible starting points, but the circles get so tight that they
aren't actually practical to drive. Everything’s getting a little weird by the time you reach 
your starting points. You drop the time gates,
sync up with your doppelgänger, and slam down the pedal. You both reach 88mph just as you complete
your three mile circuits, merge the timelines,
and save the universe.

**Transcript**:
Welcome one and all! It’s time to grab your seat
for the biggest battle in the soon-to-be-formed universe. That’s right— 
the Big Bang is about to go down! In one corner is the force that brings
all matter together. It acts on any particle with mass,
and its range is infinite— give it up for gravity! In the other corner, our contender can
push matter away with spectacular strength. When the going gets tough,
this fighter just gets tougher. That’s right, it’s pressure! Over the next several
hundred thousand years, these two contenders will be wrestling
for the fate of the universe. That’s right folks, the ripple effects
of this historic match will shape the structure of the universe
as we know it today. But what are these powers fighting over? We’ll find out when the Big Bang
hits right... now! Let’s zoom in for the play-by-play. This epic event has brought three
components into our infant universe. Dark matter, which only interacts
with gravity. Baryonic matter, which makes
up all matter you’ve ever seen, is affected by both gravity and pressure. And radiation composed 
of innumerable particles of light, also known as photons. In the moments just after the Big Bang, all three components are in equilibrium, meaning no one location
is denser than another. But as the universe starts expanding,
differences in density start to emerge. Gravity immediately gets to work
pulling matter together. Dark matter begins to collect
at the center of these increasingly
dense regions, forming the foundations
of future galaxies. Meanwhile, pressure begins gathering
its strength. In this hot, high-energy environment, protons and electrons can’t come
together to form atoms, so these loose particles zip around,
freely interacting with ambient photons. The result is almost a fluid
of baryonic matter and radiation. But the closer these baryonic particles
get, the hotter the fluid becomes, pushing photons to ping
around with incredible force. This is the power of pressure,
specifically radiation pressure, battling to push things apart. With each of gravity’s vicious tugs
squeezing photons and matter together, pressure exerts a forceful shove back. And as the two giants struggle,
they heave this fluid back and forth— creating massive waves called
baryonic acoustic oscillations. Moving at almost two thirds
the speed of light these BAOs ripple across space, impacting the universe
on the biggest scale imaginable. These rolling waves determine the
distribution of matter throughout space, meaning that today— almost 14 billion
years after this fight began— we're more likely to find
galaxies at their peaks and empty space in their troughs. And that’s not all. We can still see these ripples in the
background radiation of the universe, a permanent reminder of this epic brawl. But after being locked in a stalemate
for roughly 370,000 years, the tide of our battle finally
begins to turn. After all this time, the heat from the
Big Bang has dissipated significantly, cooling the universe down to a temperature at which loose electrons
start to pair up with protons. Known as the “era of recombination,” this stops electrons
from recklessly pinging around. This allows light to stream freely
for the first time, illuminating the universe. These photons now only exert a tiny force
on the neutral atoms they interact with, gradually reducing the power of pressure. And with that, it’s time to crown
our champion! The undefeated force,
the most pervasive power in the universe: it’s gravity! And yet, this rivalry isn’t over. A similar battle continues between these
two sworn enemies today, within every single star. As gravity pulls a star’s gas inward, pressure increases and pushes
the matter back outward. This push and pull keeps the Sun,
and all other stars, stable for billions of years. In fact, this clash of the titans
is the same reason Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t collapse
to the ground. So while their greatest fight
might have ended, these two warriors are still
to be locked in combat— even as a new challenger approaches.

Welcome one and all! It’s time to grab your seat
for the biggest battle in the soon-to-be-formed universe. That’s right— 
the Big Bang is about to go down! In one corner is the force that brings
all matter together. It acts on any particle with mass,
and its range is infinite— give it up for gravity! In the other corner, our contender can
push matter away with spectacular strength. When the going gets tough,
this fighter just gets tougher. That’s right, it’s pressure! Over the next several
hundred thousand years, these two contenders will be wrestling
for the fate of the universe. That’s right folks, the ripple effects
of this historic match will shape the structure of the universe
as we know it today. But what are these powers fighting over? We’ll find out when the Big Bang
hits right... now! Let’s zoom in for the play-by-play. This epic event has brought three
components into our infant universe. Dark matter, which only interacts
with gravity. Baryonic matter, which makes
up all matter you’ve ever seen, is affected by both gravity and pressure. And radiation composed 
of innumerable particles of light, also known as photons. In the moments just after the Big Bang, all three components are in equilibrium, meaning no one location
is denser than another. But as the universe starts expanding,
differences in density start to emerge. Gravity immediately gets to work
pulling matter together. Dark matter begins to collect
at the center of these increasingly
dense regions, forming the foundations
of future galaxies. Meanwhile, pressure begins gathering
its strength. In this hot, high-energy environment, protons and electrons can’t come
together to form atoms, so these loose particles zip around,
freely interacting with ambient photons. The result is almost a fluid
of baryonic matter and radiation. But the closer these baryonic particles
get, the hotter the fluid becomes, pushing photons to ping
around with incredible force. This is the power of pressure,
specifically radiation pressure, battling to push things apart. With each of gravity’s vicious tugs
squeezing photons and matter together, pressure exerts a forceful shove back. And as the two giants struggle,
they heave this fluid back and forth— creating massive waves called
baryonic acoustic oscillations. Moving at almost two thirds
the speed of light these BAOs ripple across space, impacting the universe
on the biggest scale imaginable. These rolling waves determine the
distribution of matter throughout space, meaning that today— almost 14 billion

**Transcript**:
For 100 days in 1994,
the African country of Rwanda suffered a horrific campaign
of mass murder. Neighbor turned against neighbor
as violence engulfed the region, resulting in the deaths of over one-tenth
of the country’s population. The seeds of this conflict were
planted a century earlier, first when German, and later Belgian,
colonizers arrived in the country. At the time, Rwanda was ruled
by a monarchy of Tutsi, one of the three ethnic groups
comprising the population. Tutsi and the even smaller Twa communities
were minority groups, while Hutu composed the majority. Many Hutus and Tutsi civilians
were on good terms, but colonial powers encouraged
political division. Belgians enforced record keeping
around ethnic identity, and created a public narrative that cast
Tutsi as elite rulers and Hutu as ordinary farmers. Over time, this propaganda led 
to intense political hostility. And while colonial powers had
largely withdrawn by 1959, lingering anger motivated a Hutu revolt, forcing many Tutsi leaders
to flee the country. Over the following decade, Rwanda transitioned to an independent
republic with a Hutu government. This new administration argued
that as the majority group, Hutu deserved exclusive access
to political power. They excluded the Tutsi minority 
by appointing offices based on population and prohibited the return of Tutsi
families that had fled years earlier. Hutu extremists also circulated propaganda blaming Tutsi for the country’s economic,
social, and political problems. Discontent with their life in exile, a small group of Tutsi insurgents
invaded Rwanda in 1990, beginning a violent civil war. The conflict lasted three years before it
was resolved with a formal peace accord. But the war’s aftermath was
rife with insecurity. While some civilians in both groups
remained amicable, the treaty intensified
political polarization. And in 1994, when a plane carrying
the Hutu Rwandan president was shot down, the conflict broke out anew. This time, Hutu officials had prepared
a deadly response to ensure they stayed in power. Working off a list of targets, government-funded Hutu militias
flooded the streets, perpetrating acts of physical
and sexual violence against Tutsi political enemies
and civilians. Over the chaotic following months, over 1 million Hutu civilians joined
their ranks due to coercion, self-preservation, or the pursuit
of personal agendas. Tutsi victims sought refuge
at churches and schools where they hoped international
organizations would protect them, but no outside party came to their aid. UN soldiers who’d overseen
the Peace Accord were instructed to abandon
Tutsi civilians, and UN leadership refused to acknowledge
the genocide taking place. The violence didn’t end until mid-July, when the Tutsi army—
who instigated the previous civil war— seized control of the country. By the time the fighting was over, roughly 800,000 Rwandans had been killed, and only a small fraction of the
Tutsi population was left alive. In the months that followed, there was no easy strategy for bringing
the killers to justice. The UN established a special tribunal
in Tanzania to try the key perpetrators. But Hutu civilians from every level
of society had committed atrocities against their neighbors, friends,
and even family members. There were roughly 120,000 Rwandans
awaiting trial, and inmates were dying from overcrowding
and poor hygiene. The new Rwandan government estimated 
it would take 100 years to prosecute every accused civilian in national court. So officials determined 
the best path forward involved looking to the country’s past. Rwanda has a traditional process for resolving interpersonal conflicts
called gacaca. Roughly translating
to “justice on the grass,” gacaca had long been used to address
offenses within villages. Local witnesses would offer testimony and could then speak for
or against the accused. Then, appointed lay judges would determine
an appropriate penalty within the community’s means. In the hope of trying perpetrators
more quickly, the government adapted gacaca
for their formal courts. These hybrid trials had 
no professional attorneys or judges, and no evidence outside the spoken word and a case file detailing the crimes
of the accused. All charges were then divided
into four categories: masterminding the genocide
and committing acts of sexual violence, participating in the killings,
physical assault, or destroying Tutsi property. Those found guilty
of the first two categories were entered into the
traditional court system, but the other crimes were
assigned set penalties which could be reduced
if the accused pled guilty. Beginning in 2002, thousands of gacaca
courts convened every week. The process proved faster 
than conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials
was mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse
their neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were
intimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that
not all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases
with Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred
during the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted
1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts 
helped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials
were a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate
to leave behind.

than conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials
was mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse
their neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were
intimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that
not all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases
with Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred
during the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted
1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts 
helped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials
were a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate
to leave behind.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around
Bell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell
that could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated
as the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization
would soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,
as this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million
to buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form
of energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives
like coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped
with rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves
in their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s
price history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,
where in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced 
the Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision
for the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally
invest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners
for the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was
highly subsidized, at times reaching four times
the market price. Several other countries soon
followed Germany’s example, implementing similar
policies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand
for solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were
able to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,
while efficiency grew. Today, a 46-square-meter rooftop
solar unit is often efficient enough to fully power a home, and this residential unit
no longer costs millions— in the US in 2022,  the average
consumer cost of a rooftop solar unit ranged from around $17,000 to $23,000. These prices dropped by over 60%
between 2010 and 2020 alone. So how much money can you save
by switching to solar? US solar equipped homeowners
can save around $1,500 per year on their energy bills, equating to a net savings of $10,000
to $30,000 during the unit’s lifetime. Month-to-month savings
tend to vary, based on the amount of direct sunlight 
your panel receives, weather conditions, and the price
of electricity where you live. But not everyone can get solar. Adopting solar can be difficult
for renters, and in many countries, more than 25% of adults don’t own
their own homes. Even if you do, your roof must meet
certain orientation and tilt requirements to make solar a worthwhile investment. And while units often pay for themselves
through offset energy costs, the initial purchase and installation
price for solar can be expensive. But several companies have adopted
solar leasing models, where they finance the material costs, installation, and upkeep
of the rooftop systems. Homeowners can then buy the panel’s
generated electricity at a fixed rate that’s generally lower
than the local utility’s price. Still, many are working
towards community-based solutions, which would enable entire neighborhoods
to profit from solar use. Europe is home to more than 7,000
community energy associations, where local members collectively
invest in wind turbines and solar panels to power their local grid. In 2005, the German town of Wolfhagen
created an 800 member citizens co-op, which communally invested $2.84 million to buy up 25% of the local energy company and expand its renewables program. Today, its turbines and panels
generate enough energy to meet the town’s needs and then some. Surplus energy is sold
to neighboring towns, and profits are reinvested
back into the community. For many, the appeal of solar
goes beyond just savings. Homes equipped with it are
more climate resilient, because they can be protected
from utility grid outages and brownouts. Not to mention solar’s key role
in decarbonizing the energy grid. By working together with larger-scale
wind and solar farms, rooftop solar units help reduce
our reliance on fossil fuels, paving the way for a cleaner
and more reliable energy future.

**Transcript**:
In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around
Bell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell
that could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated
as the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization
would soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,
as this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million
to buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form
of energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives
like coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped
with rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves
in their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s
price history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,
where in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced 
the Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision
for the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally
invest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners
for the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was
highly subsidized, at times reaching four times
the market price. Several other countries soon
followed Germany’s example, implementing similar
policies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand
for solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were
able to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,
while efficiency grew. Today, a 46-square-meter rooftop
solar unit is often efficient enough to fully power a home, and this residential unit
no longer costs millions— in the US in 2022,  the average
consumer cost of a rooftop solar unit ranged from around $17,000 to $23,000. These prices dropped by over 60%
between 2010 and 2020 alone. So how much money can you save
by switching to solar? US solar equipped homeowners
can save around $1,500 per year on their energy bills, equating to a net savings of $10,000
to $30,000 during the unit’s lifetime. Month-to-month savings
tend to vary, based on the amount of direct sunlight 
your panel receives, weather conditions, and the price
of electricity where you live. But not everyone can get solar. Adopting solar can be difficult
for renters, and in many countries, more than 25% of adults don’t own
their own homes. Even if you do, your roof must meet
certain orientation and tilt requirements to make solar a worthwhile investment. And while units often pay for themselves
through offset energy costs, the initial purchase and installation
price for solar can be expensive. But several companies have adopted
solar leasing models, where they finance the material costs, installation, and upkeep
of the rooftop systems. Homeowners can then buy the panel’s
generated electricity at a fixed rate that’s generally lower
than the local utility’s price. Still, many are working
towards community-based solutions, which would enable entire neighborhoods
to profit from solar use. Europe is home to more than 7,000
community energy associations, where local members collectively
invest in wind turbines and solar panels to power their local grid. In 2005, the German town of Wolfhagen
created an 800 member citizens co-op, which communally invested $2.84 million to buy up 25% of the local energy company and expand its renewables program. Today, its turbines and panels
generate enough energy to meet the town’s needs and then some. Surplus energy is sold
to neighboring towns, and profits are reinvested
back into the community. For many, the appeal of solar
goes beyond just savings. Homes equipped with it are
more climate resilient, because they can be protected
from utility grid outages and brownouts. Not to mention solar’s key role
in decarbonizing the energy grid. By working together with larger-scale
wind and solar farms, rooftop solar units help reduce
our reliance on fossil fuels, paving the way for a cleaner
and more reliable energy future.

Welcome to another event
in the Myth Olympics— the eternal arena in which 
creatures and deities from global mythologies
compete for glory. I’m Shamash, the Mesopotamian
god of judgment, and today we’re gathered to witness 
this year’s clash of stunning speed. Keeping track of our racers with me
is last year’s champion, Hermes— the swift-footed messenger
of the Greek gods. Oh, I'm delighted to hang up my
winged sandals today, Shamash. But I am keeping my helmet on because
we are in for a wild ride! It’s true! Almost every mythical tradition
claims one creature as the fastest of them all. From goddesses who run like the wind
to creatures who outstrip every captor, mortals of all cultures are fascinated
by superhuman swiftness. So, Hermes, who are 
this year’s contestants? Well, the Norse gods have sent Sleipnir— son of Loki and the greatest
of Asgard’s steeds. He’s usually spotted gallivanting
between the realms with Odin. But today, Sleipnir is riding solo. Also competing is Raiju, the Japanese
beast of thunder and lightning. When the weather’s nice, they like
to nap in mortals’ belly buttons. But when clouds darken, Raiju leaps
into action alongside Raijin, the Shinto god of storms. With this fearsome competitor,
lightning can strike at any time. But storms don’t scare Idaten. This Buddhist deity has a record
of outrunning the weather— his name is even part of the Japanese
expression for “run like the wind.” Idaten’s definitely got some tricks
up those steel sleeves. Perhaps, but our last competitor
has tricks of his own. Savitar is the Hindu deity
that sets everything in motion, from moving the Sun
to chasing away sorrow and sickness. Yes, today’s roster contains many
mythic interpretations of speed. From personifications 
of the unpredictable elements to creatures capable of outrunning
reality itself. But perhaps the myth of speed
is really about the elusive nature of all supernatural beings. Those are some, uh, neat ideas, Shamash—
but this race is the real deal! Our noble competitors will run
the equivalent of 100 marathons through a hazardous
natural obstacle course. And our racers are taking 
their first steps right now! Idaten takes the lead, but don’t let
that calm exterior fool you— his determination is legendary. When a literal speed demon stole
one of Buddha's teeth, he raced over mountains and rivers
to capture the culprit. Don’t forget Sleipnir— 
he’s cleared hurdles in his time, too. I’ll say! On his mission to retrieve
Baldur the Bright from the fortress of Hel,
he rode for nine days straight— clearing the gates of the underworld
without breaking a sweat. They don’t call him
the sliding one for nothing— he appears to slide on the wind itself! Of course, wind is often personified
as a sacred being that— No time for a history lesson!
That wind is picking up! Like the force of nature they are, Raiju
brews a storm to scorch the competition. It’s certainly possible. Raiju is known
for their destructive storms. But they’re also our most chaotic racer, frequently crashing to earth and 
getting tangled in flimsy mortal nets. They’re unpredictable! Chaos is often associated
with mythology’s fastest creatures, from the shapeshifting Flemish Kludde
who preys on travelers to the smelly Japanese spirit Nuppeppō
who moves too fast to be caught. True, but there are also steady agents
of speed. Here comes one now! Lending his boundless energy to the Sun,
Savitar breaks through Raiju’s storm! This golden-handed protector of the
universe can manipulate the elements— and all moving things for that matter! A valiant effort to redirect the wind
by Idaten... but not valiant enough. The path seems clear for Savitar. But is that the gallop of hooves I hear? What beautiful blindside! It’s Sleipnir hurtling 
out of another dimension! it seems the shamanic steed shares Odin’s
ability to travel between the realms. This racer might not have to play
by Savitar’s rules. But... wait a second,
am I watching this in slow motion? No! It appears the god of motion is
slowing the speed of his opponent, suspending him centimeters
from the course’s conclusion. Sleipnir’s stampede slows
to a snail’s pace as Savitar leisurely glides
over the finish line! What a finale! Savitar’s mastery of motion
immobilized his fastest foe! It seems Sleipnir’s not too happy
with this controversial result, but hey, there’s always next year. And one might say that we’re all winners
for witnessing the mind-bending speed of so many myths and legends.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to another event
in the Myth Olympics— the eternal arena in which 
creatures and deities from global mythologies
compete for glory. I’m Shamash, the Mesopotamian
god of judgment, and today we’re gathered to witness 
this year’s clash of stunning speed. Keeping track of our racers with me
is last year’s champion, Hermes— the swift-footed messenger
of the Greek gods. Oh, I'm delighted to hang up my
winged sandals today, Shamash. But I am keeping my helmet on because
we are in for a wild ride! It’s true! Almost every mythical tradition
claims one creature as the fastest of them all. From goddesses who run like the wind
to creatures who outstrip every captor, mortals of all cultures are fascinated
by superhuman swiftness. So, Hermes, who are 
this year’s contestants? Well, the Norse gods have sent Sleipnir— son of Loki and the greatest
of Asgard’s steeds. He’s usually spotted gallivanting
between the realms with Odin. But today, Sleipnir is riding solo. Also competing is Raiju, the Japanese
beast of thunder and lightning. When the weather’s nice, they like
to nap in mortals’ belly buttons. But when clouds darken, Raiju leaps
into action alongside Raijin, the Shinto god of storms. With this fearsome competitor,
lightning can strike at any time. But storms don’t scare Idaten. This Buddhist deity has a record
of outrunning the weather— his name is even part of the Japanese
expression for “run like the wind.” Idaten’s definitely got some tricks
up those steel sleeves. Perhaps, but our last competitor
has tricks of his own. Savitar is the Hindu deity
that sets everything in motion, from moving the Sun
to chasing away sorrow and sickness. Yes, today’s roster contains many
mythic interpretations of speed. From personifications 
of the unpredictable elements to creatures capable of outrunning
reality itself. But perhaps the myth of speed
is really about the elusive nature of all supernatural beings. Those are some, uh, neat ideas, Shamash—
but this race is the real deal! Our noble competitors will run
the equivalent of 100 marathons through a hazardous
natural obstacle course. And our racers are taking 
their first steps right now! Idaten takes the lead, but don’t let
that calm exterior fool you— his determination is legendary. When a literal speed demon stole
one of Buddha's teeth, he raced over mountains and rivers
to capture the culprit. Don’t forget Sleipnir— 
he’s cleared hurdles in his time, too. I’ll say! On his mission to retrieve
Baldur the Bright from the fortress of Hel,
he rode for nine days straight— clearing the gates of the underworld
without breaking a sweat. They don’t call him
the sliding one for nothing— he appears to slide on the wind itself! Of course, wind is often personified
as a sacred being that— No time for a history lesson!
That wind is picking up! Like the force of nature they are, Raiju
brews a storm to scorch the competition. It’s certainly possible. Raiju is known
for their destructive storms. But they’re also our most chaotic racer, frequently crashing to earth and 
getting tangled in flimsy mortal nets. They’re unpredictable! Chaos is often associated
with mythology’s fastest creatures, from the shapeshifting Flemish Kludde
who preys on travelers to the smelly Japanese spirit Nuppeppō
who moves too fast to be caught. True, but there are also steady agents
of speed. Here comes one now! Lending his boundless energy to the Sun,
Savitar breaks through Raiju’s storm! This golden-handed protector of the
universe can manipulate the elements— and all moving things for that matter! A valiant effort to redirect the wind
by Idaten... but not valiant enough. The path seems clear for Savitar. But is that the gallop of hooves I hear? What beautiful blindside! It’s Sleipnir hurtling 
out of another dimension! it seems the shamanic steed shares Odin’s
ability to travel between the realms. This racer might not have to play
by Savitar’s rules. But... wait a second,
am I watching this in slow motion? No! It appears the god of motion is
slowing the speed of his opponent, suspending him centimeters
from the course’s conclusion. Sleipnir’s stampede slows
to a snail’s pace as Savitar leisurely glides
over the finish line! What a finale! Savitar’s mastery of motion
immobilized his fastest foe! It seems Sleipnir’s not too happy
with this controversial result, but hey, there’s always next year. And one might say that we’re all winners
for witnessing the mind-bending speed of so many myths and legends.

**Transcript**:
Imagine opening a bag of chips only
to find Santa Claus looking back at you. Or turning the corner to see
a smile as wide as a building. Humans see faces in all kinds
of mundane objects, but these faces aren’t real— they’re illusions due to a phenomenon
known as face pareidolia. So why exactly does this happen, and how
far can this distortion of reality go? Humans are social animals, and reading faces is an important part
of our ability to understand each other. Even a glimpse of someone's face can help
you determine if you've met them before, what mood they’re in,
and if they’re paying attention to you. We even use facial features
to make snap-judgments about a person’s potential trustworthiness
or aggression. To capture all this vital information, humans have evolved to be very sensitive
to face-like structures. Whenever we see something, our brain immediately starts working
to identify the new visual stimuli based on our expectations
and prior knowledge. And since faces are so important, humans have evolved several regions
of the brain that enable us to identify them
faster than other visual stimuli. Whereas recognizing most objects takes
our brain around a quarter of a second, we can detect a face
in just a tenth of a second. It makes sense that we'd prioritize
identifying faces over everything else. But brain imaging studies 
have revealed that regions may actually be too sensitive, leading them to find faces
where they don’t exist. In one study, participants reported
seeing illusory faces in over 35% of pure-noise images
shown to them, despite the fact that nothing was there. It might seem concerning that our brains
can be so wrong so often, but these illusory faces
might actually be a byproduct of something evolutionarily advantageous. Since processing all the visual input
we encounter quickly and correctly is an enormous computational
effort for the brain, this kind of hypersensitivity might
act as a useful shortcut. After all, seeing illusory faces
is usually harmless, while missing a real face can
lead to serious issues. But for hypersensitivity to be
more helpful than harmful, our brains also need to be quick 
at determining when a face is real and when it isn’t. So how fast can our brains tell
when they’ve been duped? To answer this question,
researchers used a form of brain imaging known as magnetoencephalography. By measuring the magnetic fields caused
by electric currents in the brain, this technique allows us to track
changes in brain activity at the scale of milliseconds. With this tool, researchers revealed
that the brain generally recognizes a face as illusory
within a quarter of a second— around the same time that we can identify
most non-face visual stimuli. However, even after our brain
knows the face is fake, we can still see it in the object. And by messing with these brain areas, we can further impact our ability to
differentiate between fact from fiction. In one study, researchers stimulated
a participant’s fusiform face area while they were looking 
at a non-face object. As a result, the participant reported
momentarily seeing facial features despite the object remaining unchanged. And while looking at a real face,
stimulation of this same area created perceived distortions
of the eyes and nose. These studies suggest that certain
features are crucial to face detection. Just three dots can be enough
to represent eyes and a mouth. People will even assign gender, age,
and emotion to illusory faces. It’s unclear whether a person’s culture
or individual history impacts these perceptions, but we do know that pareidolia isn’t
unique to the human experience. Rhesus macaque monkeys show eye movements
similar to our own when observing pareidolia-inducing objects
and real faces, suggesting that this phenomenon is baked
deep into our social primate brains. So, next time you see an unexpected
face in a coffee, car, or cabinet, remember that it’s just your brain
working overtime not to miss the faces that really matter.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

or aggression. To capture all this vital information, humans have evolved to be very sensitive
to face-like structures. Whenever we see something, our brain immediately starts working
to identify the new visual stimuli based on our expectations
and prior knowledge. And since faces are so important, humans have evolved several regions
of the brain that enable us to identify them
faster than other visual stimuli. Whereas recognizing most objects takes
our brain around a quarter of a second, we can detect a face
in just a tenth of a second. It makes sense that we'd prioritize
identifying faces over everything else. But brain imaging studies 
have revealed that regions may actually be too sensitive, leading them to find faces
where they don’t exist. In one study, participants reported
seeing illusory faces in over 35% of pure-noise images
shown to them, despite the fact that nothing was there. It might seem concerning that our brains
can be so wrong so often, but these illusory faces
might actually be a byproduct of something evolutionarily advantageous. Since processing all the visual input
we encounter quickly and correctly is an enormous computational
effort for the brain, this kind of hypersensitivity might
act as a useful shortcut. After all, seeing illusory faces
is usually harmless, while missing a real face can
lead to serious issues. But for hypersensitivity to be
more helpful than harmful, our brains also need to be quick 
at determining when a face is real and when it isn’t. So how fast can our brains tell
when they’ve been duped? To answer this question,
researchers used a form of brain imaging known as magnetoencephalography. By measuring the magnetic fields caused
by electric currents in the brain, this technique allows us to track
changes in brain activity at the scale of milliseconds. With this tool, researchers revealed
that the brain generally recognizes a face as illusory
within a quarter of a second— around the same time that we can identify
most non-face visual stimuli. However, even after our brain
knows the face is fake, we can still see it in the object. And by messing with these brain areas, we can further impact our ability to
differentiate between fact from fiction. In one study, researchers stimulated
a participant’s fusiform face area while they were looking 
at a non-face object. As a result, the participant reported
momentarily seeing facial features despite the object remaining unchanged. And while looking at a real face,
stimulation of this same area created perceived distortions
of the eyes and nose. These studies suggest that certain
features are crucial to face detection. Just three dots can be enough
to represent eyes and a mouth. People will even assign gender, age,
and emotion to illusory faces. It’s unclear whether a person’s culture
or individual history impacts these perceptions, but we do know that pareidolia isn’t
unique to the human experience. Rhesus macaque monkeys show eye movements
similar to our own when observing pareidolia-inducing objects
and real faces, suggesting that this phenomenon is baked
deep into our social primate brains. So, next time you see an unexpected
face in a coffee, car, or cabinet, remember that it’s just your brain
working overtime not to miss the faces that really matter.

Imagine opening a bag of chips only

a smile as wide as a building. Humans see faces in all kinds
of mundane objects, but these faces aren’t real— they’re illusions due to a phenomenon
known as face pareidolia. So why exactly does this happen, and how
far can this distortion of reality go? Humans are social animals, and reading faces is an important part
of our ability to understand each other. Even a glimpse of someone's face can help
you determine if you've met them before, what mood they’re in,

**Transcript**:
With medical students restraining the
patient and onlookers eagerly awaiting, Scottish surgeon Robert Liston 
poised himself to begin. In quick succession, 
he cut his patient’s flesh, sawed through their tibia and fibula
and, within just a few minutes, the amputation was complete. It was the 1830s and Liston was renowned
for his surgical speed. This was important because, 
before anesthesia was widely used, patients had to consciously endure
every moment of surgery. The quest for anesthetics
that could induce unconsciousness and enable more meticulous surgeries
launched long before Liston. Around 200 CE, Chinese physician Hua Tuo
described mixing alcohol with a powder of various ingredients
to anesthetize patients. And 13th century Arab surgeon Ibn al-Quff
described patients taking anesthetics, likely inhaling drugs like cannabis, 
opium, and mandrake, from saturated sponges. By the end of the 1700s, 
many scientists were pondering chemistry’s medical applications. This led to a profusion of anesthetic
advancements involving three main players: nitrous oxide, ether, and chloroform. In 1799, English chemist Humphry Davy
began experimenting with nitrous oxide, or laughing gas— inhaling it himself
and observing its effects on friends. Davy noted that its pain-relieving
abilities might make it useful for surgical operations— but it would be decades 
before that happened. This was, at least in part,
because some surgeons and patients were skeptical of the effectiveness 
and safety of anesthetic drugs. In 1804, Japanese surgeon Seishū Hanaoka
successfully removed a breast tumor from a patient anesthetized
with a mix of medicinal herbs. But the news stayed in Japan indefinitely. Eventually, ether started garnering
medical attention. It was first formulated centuries before
then came to be used recreationally. During the so-called “ether frolics”
of the early 1800s, an American physician noted 
that the fall he suffered while using ether was painless. In 1842, he etherized a patient 
and successfully removed a tumor from his neck. In the meantime, dentists finally began
recognizing nitrous oxide’s promise. But, in 1845, when an American dentist
attempted a public tooth extraction on someone anesthetized
with nitrous oxide, he apparently encountered a setback
when his patient screamed. It was probably just an insufficient dose— but it was a bad publicity
moment for the drug. Meanwhile, dentists refined ether
for tooth extractions. And, in October 1846, an American dentist
administered ether to a patient, and a surgeon removed
the man’s neck tumor. Two months later, Liston himself performed
an upper leg amputation on an etherized patient, who reportedly regained consciousness
minutes after and asked when the procedure would begin. Further ether-enabled successes followed
from India, Russia, and beyond. But ether had issues, 
including unpleasant side effects. Scottish obstetrician James Simpson
heard about an alternative anesthetic called chloroform. And, in 1847, he and two colleagues
decided to try some themselves and promptly passed out. Soon after, Simpson
administered chloroform to one of his patients during childbirth. It quickly gained popularity
because it was fast-acting and thought to be side-effect-free— though we now know it’s harmful
and probably carcinogenic. Because anesthetics weren’t
yet fully understood, they sometimes had lethal consequences. And some doctors held sexist
and racist beliefs that dictated the amount of anesthesia they’d provide,
if any at all. American obstetrician Charles Meigs argued
that the pain of childbirth was a form of divine suffering and was skeptical that doctors 
should interfere with it. Throughout the 1840s,
American physician James Marion Sims conducted experimental gynecological
surgeries without pain relief, primarily upon enslaved Black women. By the late 19th century, 
those who could access anesthetics were undergoing increasingly
complex operations, including some that were
previously impossible. Chloroform came to be understood
as a riskier, more toxic option, and fell out of favor by the early 1900s. Alongside newer drugs, ether
and nitrous oxide are still used today— but in modified formulations that are
safer and produce fewer side effects, while doctors closely monitor
the patient’s state. Thanks to these advances, speed is not always of the essence and,
instead of acute agony, surgery can feel like just a dream.

**Transcript**:
With medical students restraining the
patient and onlookers eagerly awaiting, Scottish surgeon Robert Liston 
poised himself to begin. In quick succession, 
he cut his patient’s flesh, sawed through their tibia and fibula
and, within just a few minutes, the amputation was complete. It was the 1830s and Liston was renowned
for his surgical speed. This was important because, 
before anesthesia was widely used, patients had to consciously endure
every moment of surgery. The quest for anesthetics
that could induce unconsciousness and enable more meticulous surgeries
launched long before Liston. Around 200 CE, Chinese physician Hua Tuo
described mixing alcohol with a powder of various ingredients
to anesthetize patients. And 13th century Arab surgeon Ibn al-Quff
described patients taking anesthetics, likely inhaling drugs like cannabis, 
opium, and mandrake, from saturated sponges. By the end of the 1700s, 
many scientists were pondering chemistry’s medical applications. This led to a profusion of anesthetic
advancements involving three main players: nitrous oxide, ether, and chloroform. In 1799, English chemist Humphry Davy
began experimenting with nitrous oxide, or laughing gas— inhaling it himself
and observing its effects on friends. Davy noted that its pain-relieving
abilities might make it useful for surgical operations— but it would be decades 
before that happened. This was, at least in part,
because some surgeons and patients were skeptical of the effectiveness 
and safety of anesthetic drugs. In 1804, Japanese surgeon Seishū Hanaoka
successfully removed a breast tumor from a patient anesthetized
with a mix of medicinal herbs. But the news stayed in Japan indefinitely. Eventually, ether started garnering
medical attention. It was first formulated centuries before
then came to be used recreationally. During the so-called “ether frolics”
of the early 1800s, an American physician noted 
that the fall he suffered while using ether was painless. In 1842, he etherized a patient 
and successfully removed a tumor from his neck. In the meantime, dentists finally began
recognizing nitrous oxide’s promise. But, in 1845, when an American dentist
attempted a public tooth extraction on someone anesthetized
with nitrous oxide, he apparently encountered a setback
when his patient screamed. It was probably just an insufficient dose— but it was a bad publicity
moment for the drug. Meanwhile, dentists refined ether
for tooth extractions. And, in October 1846, an American dentist
administered ether to a patient, and a surgeon removed
the man’s neck tumor. Two months later, Liston himself performed
an upper leg amputation on an etherized patient, who reportedly regained consciousness
minutes after and asked when the procedure would begin. Further ether-enabled successes followed
from India, Russia, and beyond. But ether had issues, 
including unpleasant side effects. Scottish obstetrician James Simpson
heard about an alternative anesthetic called chloroform. And, in 1847, he and two colleagues
decided to try some themselves and promptly passed out. Soon after, Simpson
administered chloroform to one of his patients during childbirth. It quickly gained popularity
because it was fast-acting and thought to be side-effect-free— though we now know it’s harmful
and probably carcinogenic. Because anesthetics weren’t
yet fully understood, they sometimes had lethal consequences. And some doctors held sexist
and racist beliefs that dictated the amount of anesthesia they’d provide,
if any at all. American obstetrician Charles Meigs argued
that the pain of childbirth was a form of divine suffering and was skeptical that doctors 
should interfere with it. Throughout the 1840s,
American physician James Marion Sims conducted experimental gynecological
surgeries without pain relief, primarily upon enslaved Black women. By the late 19th century, 
those who could access anesthetics were undergoing increasingly
complex operations, including some that were
previously impossible. Chloroform came to be understood
as a riskier, more toxic option, and fell out of favor by the early 1900s. Alongside newer drugs, ether
and nitrous oxide are still used today— but in modified formulations that are
safer and produce fewer side effects, while doctors closely monitor
the patient’s state. Thanks to these advances, speed is not always of the essence and,
instead of acute agony, surgery can feel like just a dream.

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel.

D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes.

D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.

R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.
R: Okay.
D: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.
R: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes
R: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.
D: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.
R: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA.

**Transcript**:
Are you the person in the group who's always getting bitten by mosquitoes? Because I certainly am and science has shown that this is a thing - that mosquitoes are more attracted to some people than others. And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?
H: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?
H: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.
D: How do you blood feed them? D: With just, sticking your arm in there?
H: Well, I just put my arm in there and wait D: Is it psychologically itchy or...?
H: No it is really itchy [laughs] H: Yeah, and I'm getting, I mean, 25 bites or so right now D: Mosquitoes need our blood proteins to make their eggs, so only the female mosquitoes bite. The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?
H: Yes, you, exactly.
D: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...
D: Get some oils?
H: Yes! D: This is the right spot...
H: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...
H: Yeah
[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.
D: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?
H: I mean, sorry I-
[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.
D: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here
D: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.
H: Yes.
D: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.
H: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]
H: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.
H: Okay.
D: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...
D: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.
H: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...
D: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!
D: Hands in position!
Raquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.
R: Here we go. H: Okay. 
D: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.
D: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.
H: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!
[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?
D: I get bitten.
H: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.
H: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.
D: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?
R: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.

D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.
D: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.
R: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?
H: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!
[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Now, at the minute, you can't get access to the mosquito attractiveness test, but maybe, one day in the future, you will be able to. Right now, you can access tons of information about your physical traits, about aspects of your health, and about where you DNA and, I guess, you come from. So I thought I would share my results with you. I come from all over the world as you can see from the map, but significantly more from Europe, about 95% European. You can drill down into that and see that I'm largely British and Irish, and French and German, with a bit of Scandinavian. What's interesting to me is, there's a 3.3% South Asian which is something I think my family suspected, but didn't know for sure, so it's interesting the types of information you can find out which is stored in your DNA. So, if you wanna find out about the information in your DNA, you can go to 23andme.com/veritasium. So I want to thank 23andMe for supporting Veritasium, and I want to thank you for watching.

**Transcript**:
Legend has it, hundreds of years ago
a distant ancestor of yours stole a magical tarot deck 
from Fate herself. Today, your family is known the world over
as the world’s greatest fortune tellers. While the deck has increased 
your fortunes many times over, it came with a terrible cost. Once every 23 years, 
a door appears in your house. One member of your family must enter, and face Fate in a duel with arcane rules
only known to your opponent. And every time, 
generation after generation, the outcome is the same: Fate claims their soul. 23 years ago, your father accepted 
the challenge and lost. Today, it’s your turn. You’re pacing the dueling room 
when you stumble across something that just might change everything: your father hid a camera in the room. The tape shows him lay
out the 22 cards of the major Arcana. Fate then places an additional card,
the Soul, and speaks: “You may take any card that has 
at least one factor on the table. I’ll then receive every factor. Take the Tower, for example. It is 16, with factors 1, 2, 4, and 8. Those now belong to me,
making our score 16 to 15. If your total at the end of the game
is higher than mine, you’ll win. Play again and know that if you
run out of moves, I’ll take all the cards that remain.” As the game continues, Fate remarks that if your father 
were to win and hold the 10, that would grant him great fortune. 6, true love. And the 2 would end 
the family curse forever. But none of that matters because 
in the end his total comes up short. As the video turns to static,
Fate arrives. Feeling as if you’re in a dream, you hear her offer you the Tower 
to begin the game. How can you defeat Fate, and what other good fortune
can you win for yourself? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If you want to outplay Fate, 
you’ll need to take the long view. Accepting the 16 gives Fate
the 1, 2, 4, and 8. She effectively has the 23, 19,
17, and 13 too, since you can’t take prime numbers
once 1 is off the board. Smaller primes like 11, 7, 5, and 3
will also go to Fate, but you’ll be able to take 
their multiples, like 22 and 21. That means these are the remaining
cards in play. You can eventually claim at most
half of them, rounded down, since Fate gets at least one
for each card you take. So the best you can possibly do is
take the seven largest cards. Add those together with the 16 
and your total would be 138. And Fate’s total? Also, 138. Ties go to Fate, so it’s clear that
by offering your ancestors the 16 before explaining the full rules, Fate has been manipulating the game
to guarantee her victory. But thanks to your father,
you now know better. Speaking of your family, if you want 
to take the 2 and break the curse, you’ll have to do it on your first turn,
since it’s prime. If you do, Fate will get 1, and once again, 
Fate is guaranteed the high primes. In theory, you can get at most 
8 of the remaining 17 cards. Taking the eight largest would give 
you a nail-bitingly narrow victory of 140 to 136. But is it possible? You need Fate to get as few cards 
as possible for each one you take. You can start with the 22 and 14. With the 7 gone, 
you can take the 21, then the 15. You still need these, and the next one
you take will give Fate two cards. That’s okay though. Try the 16, for example,
and Fate gets the 4 and the 8, but you’ll still get the 12, the 18,
and the 20. Following similar reasoning, you could take the 23 on your first turn
and win the 10 or the 6. But claiming more than one
reward is impossible. So do you take wealth, love,
or break the curse? Fate is waiting, 
but the choice is up to you.

the challenge and lost. Today, it’s your turn. You’re pacing the dueling room 
when you stumble across something that just might change everything: your father hid a camera in the room. The tape shows him lay
out the 22 cards of the major Arcana. Fate then places an additional card,
the Soul, and speaks: “You may take any card that has 
at least one factor on the table. I’ll then receive every factor. Take the Tower, for example. It is 16, with factors 1, 2, 4, and 8. Those now belong to me,
making our score 16 to 15. If your total at the end of the game
is higher than mine, you’ll win. Play again and know that if you
run out of moves, I’ll take all the cards that remain.” As the game continues, Fate remarks that if your father 
were to win and hold the 10, that would grant him great fortune. 6, true love. And the 2 would end 
the family curse forever. But none of that matters because 
in the end his total comes up short. As the video turns to static,
Fate arrives. Feeling as if you’re in a dream, you hear her offer you the Tower 
to begin the game. How can you defeat Fate, and what other good fortune
can you win for yourself? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If you want to outplay Fate, 
you’ll need to take the long view. Accepting the 16 gives Fate
the 1, 2, 4, and 8. She effectively has the 23, 19,
17, and 13 too, since you can’t take prime numbers
once 1 is off the board. Smaller primes like 11, 7, 5, and 3
will also go to Fate, but you’ll be able to take 
their multiples, like 22 and 21. That means these are the remaining
cards in play. You can eventually claim at most
half of them, rounded down, since Fate gets at least one
for each card you take. So the best you can possibly do is
take the seven largest cards. Add those together with the 16 
and your total would be 138. And Fate’s total? Also, 138. Ties go to Fate, so it’s clear that
by offering your ancestors the 16 before explaining the full rules, Fate has been manipulating the game
to guarantee her victory. But thanks to your father,
you now know better. Speaking of your family, if you want 
to take the 2 and break the curse, you’ll have to do it on your first turn,
since it’s prime. If you do, Fate will get 1, and once again, 
Fate is guaranteed the high primes. In theory, you can get at most 
8 of the remaining 17 cards. Taking the eight largest would give 
you a nail-bitingly narrow victory of 140 to 136. But is it possible? You need Fate to get as few cards 
as possible for each one you take. You can start with the 22 and 14. With the 7 gone, 
you can take the 21, then the 15. You still need these, and the next one
you take will give Fate two cards. That’s okay though. Try the 16, for example,
and Fate gets the 4 and the 8, but you’ll still get the 12, the 18,
and the 20. Following similar reasoning, you could take the 23 on your first turn
and win the 10 or the 6. But claiming more than one
reward is impossible. So do you take wealth, love,
or break the curse? Fate is waiting, 
but the choice is up to you.

**Transcript**:
Ebola is one of the deadliest
viruses we know of. If left untreated, it kills
about half of those it infects. It can spread through pretty much
every fluid your body makes, including blood and sweat. Even the dead can transmit the disease,
often doing so at their own funerals. On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy
in southern Guinea got sick. Just two days later, he died. It took local doctors working 
with the international community four months to discover 
that Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been
detected outside of Central Africa. In those four months, Ebola gained 
a head start that would prove devastating. The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest
Ebola epidemic in recorded history. More than 28,000 people contracted
the disease and over 11,000 died. In 2013, Guinea had no formal
emergency response system, few trained contact tracers,
and no rapid tests, border screenings,
or licensed vaccine for Ebola. After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US 
and other international partners, completely overhauled 
their epidemic response system. And in January 2021, that system
faced its first real test. It started when a nurse in southern Guinea
developed a headache, vomiting, and fever. A few days later, she died. As dictated by traditional
burial practices, her family prepared her body 
for the funeral. Within a week, the nurse’s husband
and other family members started experiencing symptoms. Health officials suspected Ebola much
quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests. They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic 
alert system the next day. Then, lots of things
happened very quickly. Guinea’s National Agency 
for Health Security activated 38 district-level 
emergency operations centers, as well as a national one. Teams of epidemiologists and
contact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was
exposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts
that quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun 
up in the city where the outbreak started. At Guinea’s borders
with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened
more than 2 million travelers. A large-scale vaccination
campaign was started. And, finally, more than 900
community mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices
that were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola. Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended
just four months after it began. Only 23 people contracted Ebola;
only 12 died. That's less than 1% of the deaths
in the prior outbreak. The 2021 outbreak cost 
$100 million to control— which sounds like a lot
but pales in comparison to the global economic cost
of the previous outbreak: $53 billion. So should every country just copy
Guinea’s approach? Not exactly. It is always important to respond
to an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential. But beyond that, a successful response
can look very different for different diseases 
in different countries. For example, Brazil quenched
an outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive
vaccination campaign. That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global
producers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed
to regular, routine vaccinations. But for many diseases, you don't even
need a mass vaccination program. In August of 2021, a truck driver tested
positive for cholera in Burkina Faso. Health care workers alerted 
the government that same day and contact tracing began immediately. Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those
exposed or potentially exposed. This extremely fast response 
stopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started. Cholera often rears its head
in West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases
and more than 3,700 deaths. Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared,
they had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, 
health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven
outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some
animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health
authorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months,
36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system
to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued,
and ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are,
in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs,
and practices with which they live. Perhaps most importantly, we can't
expect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action
when an outbreak occurs. One of the best ways to save lives is to
invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.

in southern Guinea got sick. Just two days later, he died. It took local doctors working 
with the international community four months to discover 
that Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been
detected outside of Central Africa. In those four months, Ebola gained 
a head start that would prove devastating. The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest
Ebola epidemic in recorded history. More than 28,000 people contracted
the disease and over 11,000 died. In 2013, Guinea had no formal
emergency response system, few trained contact tracers,
and no rapid tests, border screenings,
or licensed vaccine for Ebola. After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US 
and other international partners, completely overhauled 
their epidemic response system. And in January 2021, that system
faced its first real test. It started when a nurse in southern Guinea
developed a headache, vomiting, and fever. A few days later, she died. As dictated by traditional
burial practices, her family prepared her body 
for the funeral. Within a week, the nurse’s husband
and other family members started experiencing symptoms. Health officials suspected Ebola much
quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests. They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic 
alert system the next day. Then, lots of things
happened very quickly. Guinea’s National Agency 
for Health Security activated 38 district-level 
emergency operations centers, as well as a national one. Teams of epidemiologists and
contact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was
exposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts
that quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun 
up in the city where the outbreak started. At Guinea’s borders
with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened
more than 2 million travelers. A large-scale vaccination
campaign was started. And, finally, more than 900
community mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices
that were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola. Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended
just four months after it began. Only 23 people contracted Ebola;
only 12 died. That's less than 1% of the deaths
in the prior outbreak. The 2021 outbreak cost 
$100 million to control— which sounds like a lot
but pales in comparison to the global economic cost
of the previous outbreak: $53 billion. So should every country just copy
Guinea’s approach? Not exactly. It is always important to respond
to an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential. But beyond that, a successful response
can look very different for different diseases 
in different countries. For example, Brazil quenched
an outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive
vaccination campaign. That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global
producers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed
to regular, routine vaccinations. But for many diseases, you don't even
need a mass vaccination program. In August of 2021, a truck driver tested
positive for cholera in Burkina Faso. Health care workers alerted 
the government that same day and contact tracing began immediately. Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those
exposed or potentially exposed. This extremely fast response 
stopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started. Cholera often rears its head
in West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases
and more than 3,700 deaths. Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared,
they had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, 
health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven
outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some
animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health
authorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months,
36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system
to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued,
and ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are,
in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs,
and practices with which they live. Perhaps most importantly, we can't
expect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action
when an outbreak occurs. One of the best ways to save lives is to
invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.

**Transcript**:
For almost two millennia,
the Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority
for Catholics around the world. But in the late 14th century, 
Catholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes. Where did this plethora of popes
come from? And who among them was
the genuine article? The origins of this papal predicament
began in 1296, when France’s King Philip IV decided
to raise taxes on the Church. Given the clergy’s political power, this offended Pope Boniface VIII,
leading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”: a radical decree asserting the Pope’s
total supremacy over earthly rulers. But King Philip struck back. He declared Boniface a heretic and tried
to have him arrested in a violent raid. Boniface survived the assault,
but died soon after. And following a short-lived successor,
Pope Clement V was elected in 1305. A French diplomat seeking peace in the war
between England and his homeland, Clement wanted to stay close
to the conflict and escape the demands of Rome. So in 1309, he moved the seat 
of the papacy to Avignon— a city close to France but owned
by a vassal of the Church. The papacy remained here 
for the terms of seven popes until the reigning Pope finally returned
to Italy in 1376. But just several months after his arrival,
he suddenly died. This shocking development meant a new
pope had to be elected immediately— and in Rome, where there hadn’t been
a papal election in over 70 years. The Romans were determined 
to elect one of their own and restore Rome as the seat
of Western Christendom. Local officials pressured cardinals
to choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave
and plundered the papal wine cellar. Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected
the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI. Initially, Urban was seen 
as a safe choice. But he quickly proved to be a reformer who
sought to limit the cardinal’s finances. Desperate to maintain 
their luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared 
the recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure
from the Roman mob. They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave 
to elect Pope Clement VII. Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize
the authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals. Urban named new cardinals to his court 
and entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters 
returned to Avignon. The schism had officially begun. Western Christendom now had two capitals,
Avignon and Rome, each with their own Pope
and court of cardinals. As popes from each line died, 
their cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades. This strange situation didn't impact
most ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant
doctrinal splits. Instead, the drama played 
out in the diplomatic realm. European rulers were forced 
to choose sides, as both popes vied 
for spiritual and political supremacy. Only a pope had the authority 
to call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step. So in 1409, a group of cardinals 
from France and Rome took matters into their own hands. They claimed that since both
popes were disputed, cardinals did have the right
to call a council. And at their gathering these cardinals
deposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope. Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope 
and Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council. So instead of solving the crisis, 
the number of popes rose to three. This unusual arrangement 
lasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line
and recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church
under a new Pope— Martin V. Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated
the only person still against him— the Pope of Avignon— and finally ended the schism
after 39 years. Today, the church’s official records
say the Roman Line was always the true papal power. But regardless of how the schism ended, its existence proves that even those 
who are supposed to be pious are prone to petty power struggles.

from the Roman mob. They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave 
to elect Pope Clement VII. Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize
the authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals. Urban named new cardinals to his court 
and entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters 
returned to Avignon. The schism had officially begun. Western Christendom now had two capitals,
Avignon and Rome, each with their own Pope
and court of cardinals. As popes from each line died, 
their cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades. This strange situation didn't impact
most ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant
doctrinal splits. Instead, the drama played 
out in the diplomatic realm. European rulers were forced 
to choose sides, as both popes vied 
for spiritual and political supremacy. Only a pope had the authority 
to call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step. So in 1409, a group of cardinals 
from France and Rome took matters into their own hands. They claimed that since both
popes were disputed, cardinals did have the right
to call a council. And at their gathering these cardinals
deposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope. Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope 
and Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council. So instead of solving the crisis, 
the number of popes rose to three. This unusual arrangement 
lasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line
and recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church
under a new Pope— Martin V. Undisputed, Martin swiftly excommunicated
the only person still against him— the Pope of Avignon— and finally ended the schism
after 39 years. Today, the church’s official records
say the Roman Line was always the true papal power. But regardless of how the schism ended, its existence proves that even those 
who are supposed to be pious are prone to petty power struggles.

**Transcript**:
For almost two millennia,
the Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority
for Catholics around the world. But in the late 14th century, 
Catholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes. Where did this plethora of popes
come from? And who among them was
the genuine article? The origins of this papal predicament
began in 1296, when France’s King Philip IV decided
to raise taxes on the Church. Given the clergy’s political power, this offended Pope Boniface VIII,
leading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”: a radical decree asserting the Pope’s
total supremacy over earthly rulers. But King Philip struck back. He declared Boniface a heretic and tried
to have him arrested in a violent raid. Boniface survived the assault,
but died soon after. And following a short-lived successor,
Pope Clement V was elected in 1305. A French diplomat seeking peace in the war
between England and his homeland, Clement wanted to stay close
to the conflict and escape the demands of Rome. So in 1309, he moved the seat 
of the papacy to Avignon— a city close to France but owned
by a vassal of the Church. The papacy remained here 
for the terms of seven popes until the reigning Pope finally returned
to Italy in 1376. But just several months after his arrival,
he suddenly died. This shocking development meant a new
pope had to be elected immediately— and in Rome, where there hadn’t been
a papal election in over 70 years. The Romans were determined 
to elect one of their own and restore Rome as the seat
of Western Christendom. Local officials pressured cardinals
to choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave
and plundered the papal wine cellar. Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected
the Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI. Initially, Urban was seen 
as a safe choice. But he quickly proved to be a reformer who
sought to limit the cardinal’s finances. Desperate to maintain 
their luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared 
the recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure
from the Roman mob. They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave 
to elect Pope Clement VII. Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize

**Transcript**:
It’s 1526 in what is now Northern India, and Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi is
about to face off against a prince from Central Asia, 
Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur. To quash the threat, the Sultan brings 
his war elephants to battle. But it’s said that the explosions 
of Babur’s cannons and muskets startled the elephants and they trampled
the Sultan’s own army. Babur had long harbored ambitions
of building his own empire. Though he was descended from some
of the world’s most successful conquerors, he struggled to gain a foothold among the many ambitious princes
in Central Asia. So he turned his attention to India, where his descendants stayed 
and built the Mughal Empire, one of the wealthiest and most powerful
states in the early modern world and home to nearly a quarter
of the global population. Babur died just four years 
after that fateful battle, but his own memoirs and the work 
of his descendants immortalized him in colorful fashion. His daughter, Gulbadan, recalled
in her own memoir how Babur— having recently given up drinking— filled a newly-constructed pool 
with lemonade rather than wine. His grandson, Akbar, commissioned 
exquisite miniature paintings of Babur’s stories— one depicted the empire’s
founder riding through his camp, drunkenly slumped over his horse. It was Akbar who consolidated 
Mughal power. He established protections for peasants— which in turn increased their productivity
and generated more tax revenue— and embarked on military campaigns 
to expand Mughal territory. Princes who swore allegiance to him 
were rewarded, while he made brutal examples 
of those who resisted, killing them and many of their subjects. His conquests opened access 
to port cities on the Indian Ocean, which connected the Mughals to Arab,
Chinese, Ottoman, and European traders, bringing in incalculable wealth, including silver and new crops
from the Americas. As the Muslim ruler of a diverse,
multiethnic empire, Akbar worked to create internal cohesion
by appointing members of the Hindu majority to high positions
in his government, marrying a Hindu bride, and distributing translated copies 
of the “Mahabharata,” an ancient Indian epic poem,
to his Muslim nobles. Akbar also hosted lively religious debates
where Sunni and Shia Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, and the newly arrived 
Portuguese Jesuit missionaries defended the merits 
of their respective faiths. While most participants viewed this
as an intellectual exercise, Portuguese missionaries were disappointed
by their failure to convert Akbar. The Mughals built 
architectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, a palace three kilometers around,
that housed 50,000 people and contained the magnificent gold
and jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne. Just the throne took 
seven years to construct. During its first 180 years,
the Mughals had only six rulers, which contributed 
to the empire’s stability. When the fourth emperor, Jahangir, struggled with alcohol 
and opioid addiction, his wife, Nur Jahan, 
took the reins as co-ruler. When a traitorous general captured 
her husband in an attempted coup, she negotiated his release and rallied
the army to stop the rebellion. She once led a hunting party to track down
a tiger that was terrorizing a village, leading one poet to write: “Though Nur Jahan be in form of a woman/
In the ranks of men she’s a tiger-slayer.” Following the death of the sixth emperor,
Aurangzeb, in 1707, seven emperors took the throne
over the next 21 years. These frequent transitions 
of power reflected the larger political, economic, 
social, and environmental crises that plagued the empire 
throughout the 18th century. In response to this turmoil, regional leaders started refusing to pay
taxes and broke away from Mughal control. The British East India Company offered
military support to these regional rulers, which in turn increased the company's
political influence, enabling it to eventually take
direct control of Bengal, one of the wealthiest regions in India. By the 19th century, the East India
Company had massive political influence and a large standing army, 
which included Indian troops. When these troops revolted in 1857, aiming to force out the British
and restore Mughal influence, the British government intervened, replacing company rule 
with direct colonial rule, deposing the last Mughal emperor
and sending him into exile. And so, over three centuries 
after its founding, the Mughal Empire came to an end.

**Transcript**:
It’s 1526 in what is now Northern India, and Sultan Ibrahim Lodhi is
about to face off against a prince from Central Asia, 
Zahiruddin Muhammad Babur. To quash the threat, the Sultan brings 
his war elephants to battle. But it’s said that the explosions 
of Babur’s cannons and muskets startled the elephants and they trampled
the Sultan’s own army. Babur had long harbored ambitions
of building his own empire. Though he was descended from some
of the world’s most successful conquerors, he struggled to gain a foothold among the many ambitious princes
in Central Asia. So he turned his attention to India, where his descendants stayed 
and built the Mughal Empire, one of the wealthiest and most powerful
states in the early modern world and home to nearly a quarter
of the global population. Babur died just four years 
after that fateful battle, but his own memoirs and the work 
of his descendants immortalized him in colorful fashion. His daughter, Gulbadan, recalled
in her own memoir how Babur— having recently given up drinking— filled a newly-constructed pool 
with lemonade rather than wine. His grandson, Akbar, commissioned 
exquisite miniature paintings of Babur’s stories— one depicted the empire’s
founder riding through his camp, drunkenly slumped over his horse. It was Akbar who consolidated 
Mughal power. He established protections for peasants— which in turn increased their productivity
and generated more tax revenue— and embarked on military campaigns 
to expand Mughal territory. Princes who swore allegiance to him 
were rewarded, while he made brutal examples 
of those who resisted, killing them and many of their subjects. His conquests opened access 
to port cities on the Indian Ocean, which connected the Mughals to Arab,
Chinese, Ottoman, and European traders, bringing in incalculable wealth, including silver and new crops
from the Americas. As the Muslim ruler of a diverse,
multiethnic empire, Akbar worked to create internal cohesion
by appointing members of the Hindu majority to high positions
in his government, marrying a Hindu bride, and distributing translated copies 
of the “Mahabharata,” an ancient Indian epic poem,
to his Muslim nobles. Akbar also hosted lively religious debates
where Sunni and Shia Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, and the newly arrived 
Portuguese Jesuit missionaries defended the merits 
of their respective faiths. While most participants viewed this
as an intellectual exercise, Portuguese missionaries were disappointed
by their failure to convert Akbar. The Mughals built 
architectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, a palace three kilometers around,
that housed 50,000 people and contained the magnificent gold
and jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne. Just the throne took 
seven years to construct. During its first 180 years,
the Mughals had only six rulers, which contributed 
to the empire’s stability. When the fourth emperor, Jahangir, struggled with alcohol 
and opioid addiction, his wife, Nur Jahan, 
took the reins as co-ruler. When a traitorous general captured 
her husband in an attempted coup, she negotiated his release and rallied
the army to stop the rebellion. She once led a hunting party to track down
a tiger that was terrorizing a village, leading one poet to write: “Though Nur Jahan be in form of a woman/
In the ranks of men she’s a tiger-slayer.” Following the death of the sixth emperor,
Aurangzeb, in 1707, seven emperors took the throne
over the next 21 years. These frequent transitions 
of power reflected the larger political, economic, 
social, and environmental crises that plagued the empire 
throughout the 18th century. In response to this turmoil, regional leaders started refusing to pay
taxes and broke away from Mughal control. The British East India Company offered
military support to these regional rulers, which in turn increased the company's
political influence, enabling it to eventually take
direct control of Bengal, one of the wealthiest regions in India. By the 19th century, the East India
Company had massive political influence and a large standing army, 
which included Indian troops. When these troops revolted in 1857, aiming to force out the British
and restore Mughal influence, the British government intervened, replacing company rule 
with direct colonial rule, deposing the last Mughal emperor
and sending him into exile. And so, over three centuries 
after its founding, the Mughal Empire came to an end.

**Transcript**:
All these ancient skulls have
perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly
never sporting braces. And this isn't some strange sample. According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars—
or wisdom teeth. In fact, the dental dilemmas
that fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today
appear to be recent developments. So what happened? While it’s nearly impossible
to know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis. A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived
a subsistence lifestyle. Their teeth and jaws had to work hard
to make the food they ate digestible. Indeed, the surfaces of many of their 
teeth show extensive wear and flattening. They also had larger jaws
and teeth overall. At some point, they began using tools
and fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down. A lot more time passed and,
around 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming
and domesticating animals and plants. Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people
to process and refine their food. Milling technologies helped remove
the tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran
from rice and wheat. Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically
accelerated these processes. In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved
of a great deal of their grinding, crushing, 
and pulverizing duties. And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness
appears to have become more common. Examining fossils
spanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed
a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors. Many think that, 
for most of human history, dietary shifts— like the introduction
of meat and the advent of cooking— were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size
basically kept pace with one another. But with the more recent revolutions
in agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed. As the theory goes, 
over a relatively short period, some human populations saw
a decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying
for limited space. When they do grow in,
they may displace others and get jostled into some
eccentric positions. And then wisdom teeth, which are usually
the last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further. In many cases, they have little
or no space to emerge. This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections
if not surgically removed. So larger jaws appear to be associated
with greater chewing demands. And many scientists think that as people's
diets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller—
and that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness
and impacted wisdom teeth. This hypothesis has been supported
by some preliminary experimental data. In a 1983 study, researchers
raised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough
or artificially soft food. Those fed softer food had 
more crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth, 
and narrower dental arches. And a 2004 study similarly observed
that hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth
in facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw 
and dried foods. In other words, the issue at large
seems to be environmental— or one of lifestyle—
instead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play
in some instances. It’s estimated that somewhere 
between 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding. But this trend varies 
across global populations. Some people naturally 
never have wisdom teeth. And some don’t experience 
tooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth
without a hitch. This seems to coincide with diets
that are less processed. So how can we prevent 
tooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics? Well, it’s certainly
something to chew over.

**Transcript**:
All these ancient skulls have
perfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly
never sporting braces. And this isn't some strange sample. According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars—
or wisdom teeth. In fact, the dental dilemmas
that fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today
appear to be recent developments. So what happened? While it’s nearly impossible
to know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis. A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived
a subsistence lifestyle. Their teeth and jaws had to work hard
to make the food they ate digestible. Indeed, the surfaces of many of their 
teeth show extensive wear and flattening. They also had larger jaws
and teeth overall. At some point, they began using tools
and fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down. A lot more time passed and,
around 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming
and domesticating animals and plants. Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people
to process and refine their food. Milling technologies helped remove
the tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran
from rice and wheat. Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically
accelerated these processes. In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved
of a great deal of their grinding, crushing, 
and pulverizing duties. And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness
appears to have become more common. Examining fossils
spanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed
a gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors. Many think that, 
for most of human history, dietary shifts— like the introduction
of meat and the advent of cooking— were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size
basically kept pace with one another. But with the more recent revolutions
in agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed. As the theory goes, 
over a relatively short period, some human populations saw
a decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying
for limited space. When they do grow in,
they may displace others and get jostled into some
eccentric positions. And then wisdom teeth, which are usually
the last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further. In many cases, they have little
or no space to emerge. This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections
if not surgically removed. So larger jaws appear to be associated
with greater chewing demands. And many scientists think that as people's
diets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller—
and that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness
and impacted wisdom teeth. This hypothesis has been supported
by some preliminary experimental data. In a 1983 study, researchers
raised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough
or artificially soft food. Those fed softer food had 
more crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth, 
and narrower dental arches. And a 2004 study similarly observed
that hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth
in facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw 
and dried foods. In other words, the issue at large
seems to be environmental— or one of lifestyle—
instead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play
in some instances. It’s estimated that somewhere 
between 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding. But this trend varies 
across global populations. Some people naturally 
never have wisdom teeth. And some don’t experience 
tooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth
without a hitch. This seems to coincide with diets
that are less processed. So how can we prevent 
tooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics? Well, it’s certainly
something to chew over.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, five Kenyan people
took a petition to the British Prime Minister’s office. They claimed they endured
human rights abuses in the 1950s, while Kenya was under British colonial
rule and demanded reparations. They had vivid accounts and physical scars
from their experiences— but their testimonies were undermined. They had no documentary evidence that
Britain sanctioned systems of torture against Kenyans—
at least, not yet. Thousands of secret files were
waiting to be discovered. In 2010, a historian joined 
the trial as an expert witness and attested to having seen references
to missing documents. They noted that Kenya had repeatedly
requested the return of stolen papers, which the British government had refused. In fact, many historians suspected
there were gaps in the archives. As a result, the court ordered the release
of any relevant documents. And, days later, British officials
acknowledged that 1,500 pertinent files were being held 
in a high-security archive. It soon became clear that these 
were just a small sample of documents Britain hid
between the 1950s and 70s, while former colonies 
declared independence, as part of a widespread colonial British 
policy called Operation Legacy. The policy was for British colonial
officers to destroy or remove documentation that 
might incriminate Britain and be of strategic value
to the new governments. They were instructed to destroy, alter, or secretly transport
these papers to the UK. Documents slated for destruction
were to be burnt to ashes or sunk in weighted crates far from shore. During the trial, between 2010 and 2013, an independent historian revealed 
they had located more than 20,000 previously hidden 
Operation Legacy files from 37 former colonies. Finally, an estimated 1.2 million 
colonial files, sprawling kilometers in the archive’s 
so-called “Special Collections,” were also exposed. And these were only the documents
that British forces kept. How many were destroyed— 
and what information they contained— remains unknown. About 3.5 tons of colonial documents 
were slated for incineration in Kenya. Ultimately, Operation Legacy’s objective
was to obscure critical aspects of the truth. In the words of Britain’s
attorney-general in Kenya, “If we are going to sin, 
we must sin quietly.” So, what really happened in Kenya? Beginning in 1895, the British
administration forcibly removed people from their traditional lands, giving the most fertile areas to European

and interrogation tactics. Some people were beaten to death. Others were raped or castrated. Many were shackled at the wrist for years. Children were killed. One person was burnt alive. Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua testified

**Transcript**:
In 2009, five Kenyan people
took a petition to the British Prime Minister’s office. They claimed they endured
human rights abuses in the 1950s, while Kenya was under British colonial
rule and demanded reparations. They had vivid accounts and physical scars
from their experiences— but their testimonies were undermined. They had no documentary evidence that
Britain sanctioned systems of torture against Kenyans—
at least, not yet. Thousands of secret files were
waiting to be discovered. In 2010, a historian joined 
the trial as an expert witness and attested to having seen references
to missing documents. They noted that Kenya had repeatedly
requested the return of stolen papers, which the British government had refused. In fact, many historians suspected
there were gaps in the archives. As a result, the court ordered the release
of any relevant documents. And, days later, British officials
acknowledged that 1,500 pertinent files were being held 
in a high-security archive. It soon became clear that these 
were just a small sample of documents Britain hid
between the 1950s and 70s, while former colonies 
declared independence, as part of a widespread colonial British 
policy called Operation Legacy. The policy was for British colonial
officers to destroy or remove documentation that 
might incriminate Britain and be of strategic value
to the new governments. They were instructed to destroy, alter, or secretly transport
these papers to the UK. Documents slated for destruction
were to be burnt to ashes or sunk in weighted crates far from shore. During the trial, between 2010 and 2013, an independent historian revealed 
they had located more than 20,000 previously hidden 
Operation Legacy files from 37 former colonies. Finally, an estimated 1.2 million 
colonial files, sprawling kilometers in the archive’s 
so-called “Special Collections,” were also exposed. And these were only the documents
that British forces kept. How many were destroyed— 
and what information they contained— remains unknown. About 3.5 tons of colonial documents 
were slated for incineration in Kenya. Ultimately, Operation Legacy’s objective
was to obscure critical aspects of the truth. In the words of Britain’s
attorney-general in Kenya, “If we are going to sin, 
we must sin quietly.” So, what really happened in Kenya? Beginning in 1895, the British
administration forcibly removed people from their traditional lands, giving the most fertile areas to European
settlers to establish large-scale farms. They mandated forced labor systems, implemented reservations 
for Indigenous African peoples, and restricted their movement. Kenyan people resisted 
these incursions from the start and grew increasingly organized over time. One movement, 
the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, aimed to forcibly remove white settlers
and overthrow the colonial government. When the British declared

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, native Takhi 
horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia. But by the late 1960s, 
they’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling 
in meager habitats against hunters and competition 
from local livestock. Some small groups of Takhi
survived in European zoos, but their extinction 
still seemed inevitable. To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos
pulled together to start an international 
Takhi breeding program. By the 1990s, these collaborators
in Europe and the US began releasing new generations 
of Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat. This Takhi revival was a world-famous
conservation victory, but the full story is much more
complicated than it first appears. And its twists and turns raise serious
questions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means. To get the whole story, 
we need to start in the late 1800s when Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky
was gifted the remains of one of these wild horses. Though the Takhi had long been
known to local Mongolians, European scientists were intrigued
by the remains, which looked more like those of a donkey
or zebra than any known domestic horse. They concluded the species was a sort
of missing link between wild asses and modern horses. And as reports of the newly dubbed 
Przhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire
the previously unknown species. At this time, zoos were focused primarily
on drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned
with entertainment than animal welfare. But in the early 1900s, the near
extinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species
like the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand 
as centers for conservation. And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s
horse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain
the captive population. However, the individuals behind these
programs came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred. Like their colleagues, they believed
the species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses 
and their more primitive ancestors. They also knew that some of the horses in
their collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble 
the species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them
to determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly. Basing their work on just a few specimens
and broad beliefs about what a primitive horse 
might look like, they created a rigorous model 
for the ideal Takhi. And over the 20th century, breeders in western zoos 
and private collections created a population 
of thousands of horses all carefully bred to share the same
physical characteristics. Of course, in their native habitat, wild Takhi had regularly interbred 
with domesticated horses for millennia, producing a population with much
more diverse appearances. So when it was time to introduce 
the Takhi to their ancestral home, they were quite different from the horses who’d been taken from those steppes
a century earlier. Complicating things even further, while these new Takhi herds were
no longer in zoos, to this day, almost all 
remain closely monitored and controlled for their own protection. So in a strange way, it’s hard to say 
if these animals are actually in the wild or even if they’re truly Takhi. The story of the Takhi horse 
is not unique. In many of our conservation victories, it’s difficult to say exactly
what was saved, and the role that zoos play 
in conservation can be very complicated. It's clear that zoos have been and can
continue to be significant forces for animal preservation, especially efforts to save 
charismatic animals from extinction. But today, the most direct
cause of animal extinctions are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats
and Earth’s climate. So if zoos truly want to help protect the
diversity of animal life on this planet, perhaps they should redirect their efforts to preserving the natural habitats
these animals so desperately need.

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, native Takhi 
horses roamed the steppes of Central Asia. But by the late 1960s, 
they’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling 
in meager habitats against hunters and competition 
from local livestock. Some small groups of Takhi
survived in European zoos, but their extinction 
still seemed inevitable. To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos
pulled together to start an international 
Takhi breeding program. By the 1990s, these collaborators
in Europe and the US began releasing new generations 
of Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat. This Takhi revival was a world-famous
conservation victory, but the full story is much more
complicated than it first appears. And its twists and turns raise serious
questions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means. To get the whole story, 
we need to start in the late 1800s when Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky
was gifted the remains of one of these wild horses. Though the Takhi had long been
known to local Mongolians, European scientists were intrigued
by the remains, which looked more like those of a donkey
or zebra than any known domestic horse. They concluded the species was a sort
of missing link between wild asses and modern horses. And as reports of the newly dubbed 
Przhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire
the previously unknown species. At this time, zoos were focused primarily
on drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned
with entertainment than animal welfare. But in the early 1900s, the near
extinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species
like the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand 
as centers for conservation. And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s
horse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain
the captive population. However, the individuals behind these
programs came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred. Like their colleagues, they believed
the species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses 
and their more primitive ancestors. They also knew that some of the horses in
their collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble 
the species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them
to determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly. Basing their work on just a few specimens
and broad beliefs about what a primitive horse 
might look like, they created a rigorous model 
for the ideal Takhi. And over the 20th century, breeders in western zoos 
and private collections created a population 
of thousands of horses all carefully bred to share the same
physical characteristics. Of course, in their native habitat, wild Takhi had regularly interbred 
with domesticated horses for millennia, producing a population with much
more diverse appearances. So when it was time to introduce 
the Takhi to their ancestral home, they were quite different from the horses who’d been taken from those steppes
a century earlier. Complicating things even further, while these new Takhi herds were
no longer in zoos, to this day, almost all 
remain closely monitored and controlled for their own protection. So in a strange way, it’s hard to say 
if these animals are actually in the wild or even if they’re truly Takhi. The story of the Takhi horse 
is not unique. In many of our conservation victories, it’s difficult to say exactly
what was saved, and the role that zoos play 
in conservation can be very complicated. It's clear that zoos have been and can
continue to be significant forces for animal preservation, especially efforts to save 
charismatic animals from extinction. But today, the most direct
cause of animal extinctions are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats
and Earth’s climate. So if zoos truly want to help protect the
diversity of animal life on this planet, perhaps they should redirect their efforts to preserving the natural habitats
these animals so desperately need.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
1,700 years ago, a Chinese
alchemist named Ge Hong was renowned for his special soup that
could cure diarrhea-stricken patients. The stew was deep yellow,
and had an intense aroma. And, like many family recipes,
it had a secret ingredient. But in this case, that ingredient
didn’t come from the kitchen— it came from the bathroom. It might seem unwise to consume feces, and today, there aren’t many doctors 
who would prescribe Ge Hong’s recipe. However, exciting new research suggests
that taking poop into the body in other ways might benefit our health. One such treatment 
is fecal microbial transplantation, and the secret to how it works
lives in your gut. Trillions and trillions of bacteria, 
viruses, fungi, and archaea consider your bowels their home. Collectively, these microbes make 
up what’s known as your gut microbiome, and each of these organisms
possesses dynamic, specialized abilities that seem to be essential for human life. They break down our food, make vitamins, train our immune system
and circadian rhythm, and even protect us from infections. In return, they receive 
a nice warm place to live, complete with an all-you-can-eat buffet. Some research suggests our microbiomes
might start forming in the womb, but if not, they certainly get
started when we're born. During a vaginal birth, infants take 
in some of their mother’s fecal matter and microbe-filled fluids. From then on, our microbiomes 
are constantly diversifying with exposure to various 
foods and environments. This is essential for maintaining 
gut health. If poor nutrition, chronic disease or
antibiotics disturb this delicate balance, the body can become vulnerable to problems like bacteria and fungal overgrowth 
or infectious diarrhea. But infusing a new batch
of microorganisms into the intestine seems to help reset the gut microbiome— this is where fecal microbial transplants
come into play. This line of treatment is still very new, and there are tons of unanswered
questions about how it works. So currently, the US Food and Drug
Administration only allows doctors to use fecal transplants experimentally for battling one of the toughest 
gut infections— antibiotic-resistant 
Clostridiodes difficile. This infectious bacterium forms spores in
the colon that are immune to antibiotics and very difficult to destroy. Patients dealing with this infection can
experience months of intermittent fevers alongside bouts of abdominal cramping 
and extreme diarrhea despite antibiotic treatment. So when symptoms get this bad, it’s time
for a fecal microbial transplant. To start the process, a gastroenterologist first retrieves 
some feces, typically from a stool bank. These frozen samples are particularly
impressive number twos— the selected donors go 
through a strict process to ensure their samples 
are infection-free. In fact, these protective protocols
are so stringent, one prominent stool bank’s 
acceptance rate is less than 3%. Next, the gastroenterologist gets 
that sample inside the patient via a pill, or, more commonly, a tube 
into the stomach or colon. Finally, the transplanted microbes 
migrate through the tract until they find the colon, where they quickly multiply
and displace the infectious invader. This process is so effective that it cures
over 80% of patients in just one treatment. Because each stool sample is unique, the FDA still classifies fecal transplants
as an experimental treatment rather than a formal medication. But promising research in rodents 
suggests new ways we might use fecal bacteriotherapy
in the future. For example, fecal transplants 
from non-diabetic mice improved insulin resistance in mice
with type 2 diabetes. Similarly, some studies have shown
mice exhibiting anxiety and depression become calmer after transplants 
from their less anxious peers. Scientists studying humans have 
even started finding different microbial patterns associated with various intestinal,
autoimmune, oncologic, and even psychiatric disorders. So, it seems entirely possible
that altering a patient’s microbiome could allow for multiple new modes
of treatment. We still have a lot to learn about what
makes the “best” gut microbiome, or the most beneficial fecal transplants. But for now, at least we can say
that our feces have a bright future.

**Transcript**:
1,700 years ago, a Chinese
alchemist named Ge Hong was renowned for his special soup that
could cure diarrhea-stricken patients. The stew was deep yellow,
and had an intense aroma. And, like many family recipes,
it had a secret ingredient. But in this case, that ingredient
didn’t come from the kitchen— it came from the bathroom. It might seem unwise to consume feces, and today, there aren’t many doctors 
who would prescribe Ge Hong’s recipe. However, exciting new research suggests
that taking poop into the body in other ways might benefit our health. One such treatment 
is fecal microbial transplantation, and the secret to how it works
lives in your gut. Trillions and trillions of bacteria, 
viruses, fungi, and archaea consider your bowels their home. Collectively, these microbes make 
up what’s known as your gut microbiome, and each of these organisms
possesses dynamic, specialized abilities that seem to be essential for human life. They break down our food, make vitamins, train our immune system
and circadian rhythm, and even protect us from infections. In return, they receive 
a nice warm place to live, complete with an all-you-can-eat buffet. Some research suggests our microbiomes
might start forming in the womb, but if not, they certainly get
started when we're born. During a vaginal birth, infants take 
in some of their mother’s fecal matter and microbe-filled fluids. From then on, our microbiomes 
are constantly diversifying with exposure to various 
foods and environments. This is essential for maintaining 
gut health. If poor nutrition, chronic disease or
antibiotics disturb this delicate balance, the body can become vulnerable to problems like bacteria and fungal overgrowth 
or infectious diarrhea. But infusing a new batch
of microorganisms into the intestine seems to help reset the gut microbiome— this is where fecal microbial transplants
come into play. This line of treatment is still very new, and there are tons of unanswered
questions about how it works. So currently, the US Food and Drug
Administration only allows doctors to use fecal transplants experimentally for battling one of the toughest 
gut infections— antibiotic-resistant 
Clostridiodes difficile. This infectious bacterium forms spores in
the colon that are immune to antibiotics and very difficult to destroy. Patients dealing with this infection can
experience months of intermittent fevers alongside bouts of abdominal cramping 
and extreme diarrhea despite antibiotic treatment. So when symptoms get this bad, it’s time
for a fecal microbial transplant. To start the process, a gastroenterologist first retrieves 
some feces, typically from a stool bank. These frozen samples are particularly
impressive number twos— the selected donors go 
through a strict process to ensure their samples 
are infection-free. In fact, these protective protocols
are so stringent, one prominent stool bank’s 
acceptance rate is less than 3%. Next, the gastroenterologist gets 
that sample inside the patient via a pill, or, more commonly, a tube 
into the stomach or colon. Finally, the transplanted microbes 
migrate through the tract until they find the colon, where they quickly multiply
and displace the infectious invader. This process is so effective that it cures
over 80% of patients in just one treatment. Because each stool sample is unique, the FDA still classifies fecal transplants
as an experimental treatment rather than a formal medication. But promising research in rodents 
suggests new ways we might use fecal bacteriotherapy
in the future. For example, fecal transplants 
from non-diabetic mice improved insulin resistance in mice
with type 2 diabetes. Similarly, some studies have shown
mice exhibiting anxiety and depression become calmer after transplants 
from their less anxious peers. Scientists studying humans have 
even started finding different microbial patterns associated with various intestinal,
autoimmune, oncologic, and even psychiatric disorders. So, it seems entirely possible
that altering a patient’s microbiome could allow for multiple new modes
of treatment. We still have a lot to learn about what
makes the “best” gut microbiome, or the most beneficial fecal transplants. But for now, at least we can say
that our feces have a bright future.
