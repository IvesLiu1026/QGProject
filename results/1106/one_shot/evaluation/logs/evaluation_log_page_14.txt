**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 1: Who designed a test for children who were struggling in school in France in 1905?**

Although the question is not an exact match, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the original purpose of IQ tests created by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon, while the generated MCQ asks about who designed the test. However, the correct answer to the generated MCQ (C. Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon) is closely related to the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ (D. To determine who could benefit from education).

To make the generated MCQ more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the question could be rephrased to focus on the purpose of the test, rather than who designed it. Nevertheless, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What was one of the first large-scale implementations of IQ testing?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the same topic (the history of IQ testing) and has some overlap with the ground truth MCQ's options (specifically, option B in the ground truth MCQ and option B in Question 5 both mention the military's use of IQ tests).

However, a closer match is actually **not present** among the provided generated MCQs, as none of them directly address the same question intent as the ground truth MCQ (i.e., identifying an inaccurate statement about IQ tests).

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on content and intent, I would say that **none of the generated MCQs** closely match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you insist on an index, I would say that **Question 7** is the closest match, as it deals with the historical context of IQ testing and its misuse, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's topic.

Index: 7 (with the caveat that it's not a very close match)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content of the transcript and the generated MCQs, I can infer that the most similar generated MCQ would be related to the Middle Colonies.

The closest match is Question 9, which mentions the diversity of the Middle colonies. However, it does not explicitly ask about the current states that made up the Middle Colonies.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 9 is the closest, although it's not a perfect match.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9 (with the caveat that it's not a perfect match)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the current states that represented the Southern Colonies. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 6 mentions the Southern colonies and discusses a related topic, which is the main source of labor in the Southern colonies.

However, a closer look at the options of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 5 is somewhat related to the Southern colonies, and one of its options (B. Tobacco) is a cash crop that was commonly grown in the Southern colonies.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the one that discusses the population of a specific region (the Middle colonies), which is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ that asks about the current states that represented the Southern Colonies.

Considering these factors, I would say that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not a direct match, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 9, but with a different region (Southern colonies instead of Middle colonies).

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 9

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the sound of the digraph "WH" being similar to the letter "W", whereas the generated MCQs are about the story and events in the transcript.

However, since I need to provide an index, I will choose the one that is least unrelated to the ground truth MCQ. I choose **Question 2**, not because it matches the ground truth MCQ, but because it is the first question that mentions the alphabet, which is the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. Question 4 asks about what helped the characters make their task easier, and one of the options is "An elephant", which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the animal with "PH" in its name that helps the letters collect the alphabet, but since there is no generated MCQ that exactly matches this question, Question 4 is the closest match.

You know much like buildings, text especially informational and nonfiction texts have to be structurally sound or else When you read informational texts you see the pattern in the way that its written. yeah There are five main structures you can check. Find the structure and they get less complex. Let's flex and break down all five. Follow me, the Text Structure Mastermind. This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast. It explains how things are different in the same with the words in bold I'm about to say both the tower of Pisa's construction and the Washington monument saw disruption. The Washington monument, Named after George, had constuction paused for the Civil War. But the purposes of the buildings were different One was erected as a church bell tower while the other honored a Founding Father There we compared the two differenct structures thats five text structures in 1/16 of an hour In text, I find description, sequence, cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day In text I find description I find sequence cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day. There's a problem and solution I bet

You know much like buildings, text especially informational and nonfiction texts have to be structurally sound or else When you read informational texts you see the pattern in the way that its written. yeah There are five main structures you can check. Find the structure and they get less complex. Let's flex and break down all five. Follow me, the Text Structure Mastermind. This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: Which of the following words is commonly used in the text structure "Sequence"?**

Although the question is not an exact match, the intent of the ground truth MCQ is to understand the importance of the "Sequence" text structure, which is related to the concept of a timeline of events. Question 2 is the closest match because it asks about a specific word commonly used in the "Sequence" text structure, which is related to the idea of a timeline of events.

However, a closer match would be a question that directly asks about the purpose or importance of the "Sequence" text structure. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose:

**Question 2**

However, I would like to note that the similarity is not very high, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the importance or purpose of the "Sequence" text structure.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up

and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the continent with desert for miles. The most similar generated MCQ is not directly asking about the desert, but Question 2 is asking about a specific characteristic of a continent (more than half of the world's population living in it) and includes Africa as an option, which is the continent mentioned in the ground truth MCQ as having desert for miles. However, this is not a perfect match.

A more suitable match can be found by looking at the options and the content of the generated MCQs. Question 3 mentions the Nile River, which is located in Africa, and the song lyrics mention "I am Africa, with desert for miles and my Nile is the longest river." This connection makes Question 3 a better match for the ground truth MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the intent of comparing or identifying continent-related information, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity.

The most similar generated MCQ would be Question 4: "Which continent is known for having a large rainforest?" 

However, this question does not directly compare the size of continents as the ground truth MCQ does. It does mention a characteristic (rainforest) of South America, which is one of the continents mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 4 is the closest match, but with a very low similarity score.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQ that comes closest to the ground truth MCQ is not present in the list.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest, but it's still not a good match. Question 8 asks "Which continent has a lot of islands?" and one of the options is "Australia", which is also an option in the ground truth MCQ. However, the question intent and content are still quite different.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks "Which of the following is NOT a continent?" with options that include a fictional or non-existent continent, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a good match, I would recommend generating new MCQs that better align with the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you still want me to provide an index, I would say that the closest match is not present, but if I had to choose one, it would be:

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Leonardo DaVinci's professions, and the correct answer is "all of the above" (architect, scientist, inventor, engineer). While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks about DaVinci's professions, I found that Question 1 mentions DaVinci as the painter of the Mona Lisa, but it doesn't ask about his other professions.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1. However, please note that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the popularity of portrait paintings during the Renaissance, and the correct answer is related to the growing merchant class and the mounting interest in humanism.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest in terms of historical context, but it asks about the meaning of "Mona" in the title "Mona Lisa", which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I would like to point out that the transcript does mention the growing merchant class and the mounting interest in humanism as factors that popularized portrait-painting during the Renaissance. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, but with a clear understanding that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2 (with the caveat mentioned above)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the topic of the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require generating new MCQs that specifically target the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Lisa Del Giocondo's age when her portrait was painted by DaVinci. Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is the closest match, as it asks about the subject of the "Mona Lisa" painting. However, it does not specifically ask about Lisa's age.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

Index: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs do not explicitly contain a question about Lisa's age, so the match is not perfect.

property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile

from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile

to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Question 9: What is the speaker's suggestion for charities to encourage donors to give more? Options: A. Reward donors with material gifts., B. Provide donors with recognition for their donation., C. Offer donors the opportunity to see the specific impact of their generosity., D. Send donors regular newsletters about the charity's work.**

This generated MCQ is similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions focus on the speaker's suggestion for charities to encourage donors to give more, and the correct option in both cases involves providing donors with the opportunity to see the specific impact of their generosity.

However, I noticed that the ground truth MCQ has a more specific context, which is about founding a new charity to help disadvantaged people in the community. Therefore, I would like to suggest that the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not a perfect match, but rather a similar one.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 9**. However, I would like to note that the generated MCQs do not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that takes into account the specific context of founding a new charity to help disadvantaged people in the community.

In this case, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ, such as:

**Question: Imagine that you were founding a new charity to help disadvantaged people in your community. Based on this talk, what should you aim to do? Options: A. Provide opportunities for donors to see the impact they are having., B. Provide opportunities for donors to connect with the individuals they are helping., C.

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving

**Transcript**:
This octopus is making a quick escape… with the help of its suckers. The suckers are incredibly strong. And while we only have two hands to grab things,
an octopus holds on with hundreds of suckers running up and down each arm. Suckers come in pretty handy to get around. Or to grab a bite to eat. Or to hang onto your keeper’s arm. So how do suckers stick so well? It’s not super glue. It’s water pressure. Each sucker has a ring called an infundibulum. It creates a water-tight seal. Inside the sucker there’s a chamber, like
a cup, called the acetabulum. It’s full of water. When the octopus expands the chamber, it lowers
the pressure inside. The higher pressure outside pushes against
the sucker creating a powerful grip. Suckers get such a workout that their skin
sloughs off every few weeks. See that ring-shaped piece of skin floating
by? It used to be the bottom of a sucker. Suckers have another super-power. They actually can smell and taste. That helps the octopus tell there’s no snail
inside this shell. Hundreds of suckers tasting and smelling,
and flexible arms moving every which way, create a huge amount of information -- a lot
for the octopus’ central brain to process. So each arm has a mind of its own. In fact, two thirds of an octopus’ neurons
are in its arms. That means the central brain isn’t really
calling all the shots. The central brain tells the arms how fast
to move. But the instructions on how to reach come
from each arm. It’s a nifty way to process all that information,
making the octopus the well-choreographed creature we know. AMY: Hi. This is Amy Standen. You may have noticed a different voice on
Deep Look today. My good friend and fellow science reporter
Lauren Sommer is taking over for me as host of the series. LAUREN: Thanks, Amy. I'm excited to be here. If you like cephalopods, check out our episode

However, another generated MCQ (not provided) could be: 
What do the suckers on an octopus' arm help it to do? 
Options: A. move around, B. hold onto things, C. catch food, D. a and b only, E. all of the above 

Since this is not an option, the closest match is Question 2.

However, Question 2's options do not match the ground truth MCQ's options. But among the provided options, Question 2 is the closest match in terms of content.

**Transcript**:
This octopus is making a quick escape… with the help of its suckers. The suckers are incredibly strong. And while we only have two hands to grab things,
an octopus holds on with hundreds of suckers running up and down each arm. Suckers come in pretty handy to get around. Or to grab a bite to eat. Or to hang onto your keeper’s arm. So how do suckers stick so well? It’s not super glue. It’s water pressure. Each sucker has a ring called an infundibulum. It creates a water-tight seal. Inside the sucker there’s a chamber, like
a cup, called the acetabulum. It’s full of water. When the octopus expands the chamber, it lowers
the pressure inside. The higher pressure outside pushes against
the sucker creating a powerful grip. Suckers get such a workout that their skin
sloughs off every few weeks. See that ring-shaped piece of skin floating
by? It used to be the bottom of a sucker. Suckers have another super-power. They actually can smell and taste. That helps the octopus tell there’s no snail
inside this shell. Hundreds of suckers tasting and smelling,
and flexible arms moving every which way, create a huge amount of information -- a lot
for the octopus’ central brain to process. So each arm has a mind of its own. In fact, two thirds of an octopus’ neurons
are in its arms. That means the central brain isn’t really
calling all the shots. The central brain tells the arms how fast
to move. But the instructions on how to reach come
from each arm. It’s a nifty way to process all that information,
making the octopus the well-choreographed creature we know. AMY: Hi. This is Amy Standen. You may have noticed a different voice on

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What is the function of the infundibulum in an octopus' sucker? 

Although the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the ring that comprises the structure of the octopus' suckers, while Question 4 asks about the function of the infundibulum, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a more precise match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the name of the ring in the sucker's structure. Unfortunately, such a question does not exist among the provided generated MCQs.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

**Transcript**:
India and China, together, are home to over
2.7 billion people. That's as many humans as in the next 20 most
populous countries combined, or in the whole other 170 countries in the world. Over the last 300 years, India and China each
added more than a billion people to their populations, way more than any other country,
but they have actually been growing at about the same rate as the rest of the world. They have a lot more people today because
they had a lot more people a few hundred years ago, when the world began its period of modern,
and rapid, population growth. It's like comparing a big bank account and
a small one. If they both grow at about the same rate over
many years, the big one gains a lot more money, simply because it started with more. So the billion-dollar, er, billion-person
question, is why did India and China have so many people when they started their rapid
growth? We can’t know for sure, since so many variables
factor into long-term population dynamics, but the two most plausible explanations are
food and area. Having lots of fertile land and good access
to fresh water makes it possible to grow lots of food, which in turn makes it possible to
nourish a lot of people. Even today, the 10 most populated countries
in the world all have a relatively large amount of farmland. And Asia - and in particular south and east
Asia - has tons of farmland, lots of river valleys, and the ability to grow food year-round. Plus, domestication of plants and animals
essentially started in Asia, giving populations an early leg - or wing - up. As such, Asia’s been the most densely populated
region of the world for a really long time. Area matters too; countries like Pakistan
and Bangladesh may be filled with farms and densely-populated, but because they’re smaller
in area than India and China, they simply cannot contain as many people. Of course, a few other things happened in
India and China in the last few thousand years, and some of them helped the populations grow,
and some of them shrank the populations, but through it all, the large and fertile lands
of India and China were able to sustain lots of people, such that when the era of modern
population growth came around, they had a head start. Or rather, a hundred-million-head start. This video was sponsored by the University
of Minnesota, where students, faculty and staff across all fields of study are working

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, we can identify a similar question.

The ground truth MCQ is about the relationship between the amount of sugar dissolved in a plant's sap and the amount of water it encourages to come out of an insect's digestive tract by osmosis.

A similar question can be created using the information from the generated MCQs, specifically Question 10, which mentions osmosis. However, Question 10 does not directly address the relationship between sugar content and water loss.

If we had to choose from the provided generated MCQs, the closest match would be Question 10, as it at least mentions the process of osmosis, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 10

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require creating a new question that specifically addresses the relationship between sugar content and water loss due to osmosis.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the topic and the type of question being asked.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the type of bug that aphids are not in the same order as. The closest generated MCQ in terms of topic is Question 3, which asks about why plants try to defend themselves against aphids. However, this question is not similar in terms of content and options.

A more similar question would be one that asks about the classification or characteristics of aphids. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the closest in terms of the topic of aphids and their relationships with other insects. However, this question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, if you insist on an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose, it would be Question 8, with the caveat that it's not a good match.

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The enzyme sucrase (in aphids’ guts) converts two molecules of sucrose into:

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What is the name of the enzyme that helps aphids to neutralize the high sugar content of plant sap? Options: A. Sucrase, B. Lactase, C. Amylase, D. Protease.

However, the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the function of sucrase, rather than just its name.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the conversion of sucrose by sucrase, but such a question is not present in the provided list.

Given the available options, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4, but with the caveat that it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the
original package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids
or comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough
from the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical
candidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they
are far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its
nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth
water, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,
and oceans. And thus the water that turned our planet
into a blue marble came, quite literally,

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What happened to the gas cloud in the early solar system? Options: A. It condensed to form the rocky planets, B. It was pushed farther out by the solar wind, C. It disappeared into space, D. It formed the sun.

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that directly addresses the formation of the sun. Since this is not available among the options, the closest match would be a question that discusses the early solar system formation process.

But considering the available options, the closest match is Question 3, but it doesn't match the ground truth MCQ's intent. If we were to choose an answer, it would be Question 3, but with the understanding that it's not an exact match.

However, another look at the generated MCQs reveals that Question 10 has an option that mentions the origin of something in the solar system. Question 10's options discuss the origin of the water that turned Earth into a "blue marble." Among the generated MCQs, there isn't a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

However, looking at the content of the transcript, we can infer that the formation of the sun is discussed in the same context as the formation of the solar system. The closest generated MCQ related to this topic would be Question 3, but as mentioned earlier, it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs for the ground truth MCQ, and given the options provided, the closest match would be Question 3, but with the understanding that it doesn't exactly match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

However, if we were to choose an answer based solely on the closest match to the formation of the solar system, it would be Question 3.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question matches the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the reason why water, in the form of ice, couldn't have been present in the early inner solar system. The correct answer in the ground truth MCQ is "Both B and C", which corresponds to the fact that the early inner solar system was too hot for frozen water (B) and any water vapor would have been blasted away by the solar wind (C). Question 4's option B states that "The early inner solar system was too hot for frozen water", which aligns with one of the correct reasons in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that Question 4 doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it doesn't provide the option for "any water vapor would have been blasted away by the solar wind" (C) or the combination of both reasons (D). Nevertheless, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 4 is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth
water, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,
and oceans. And thus the water that turned our planet
into a blue marble came, quite literally,

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the
original package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids
or comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough
from the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical
candidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they
are far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its
nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost

hi i'm brad meltzer welcome to story time number two this one is i am abraham lincoln our goal is to give your kids better heroes to look up to teach them lessons of kindness and compassion especially today we need it uh especially in our leaders so we are going to start i have the book right here let me just find it here way this joke is running so long and notice that these are all by the way this is all here all the lightsabers that were in our house i like this no not those no not harry potter's broom no we'll get sued for that anyway oh here it is tada that was acting by the way i am abraham lincoln the reason i wrote this book is you know as i always say that the lesson in every one of these books is always on the back so it's i am abraham lincoln by my favorite author brad meltzer my favorite illustrator chris eliopoulos who is our amazing artist um on the back it says the lesson i will always speak my mind and speak for others and so um one of the things that you're going to see in this one is this is going to focus for you who are xavier riddle fans is dr zoom can you believe it edina has a stuffed doctor zoom i have a stuffed abraham lincoln that's right i do so we're gonna learn um and dr zoom is gonna play a major role in this book uh you scream yell when you see him uh or her i should say and this is i am abraham lincoln by brad meltzer and christopher elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be forgotten look he's on the penny i am abraham lincoln i will never stop fighting for what's right and i hope you remember that when you speak your mind and speak for others there's no more powerful way to be heard and that is the end of i am abraham lincoln and as always i'm going to take some questions that you guys have sent me um and let's see some good questions here uh it says are all those lightsabers yours they are all ours i told you you think i'm making this up they're all ours now by the way someone said we got this right where is dr zoom did you miss it come on the turtle look there's a turtle on this page hint hint dr zoom dr zoom look our favorite dr zoom oh i like this question who is coming next oh that's a good question okay so let's see if i haven't had oh wait you know what this is why i love okay ready so you've seen obviously we have i'm abraham lincoln the next one that's coming is right here i am leonardo da vinci he's coming and then after that we're doing i am benjamin franklin we're doing i am anne frank and i'm not going to tell you who's after that because it's a surprise on xavier riddle you're going to see i'm not supposed to say anything i'm not supposed to talk about it they told me not to tell anyone who's coming that is coming soon on xavier riddle i never said it see pbs kids i never said it abraham lincoln's coming see i didn't even say that that wasn't me it was it was him that's who did it anyway my name is brad meltzer thank you for tuning in we still do not have a crayon utility belt like brad wears his crayon utility belt on xavier rail but again i promise you i will get a crayon utility belt it is coming i determined to find one um thank you for joining us and let me entertain your kids today in this these crazy times keep reading keep reading the most important keep being nice to each other [Music] hi everybody i'm chris eliopoulos i'm the co-creator of xavier riddle and the secret museum on pbs kids i'm also a cartoonist illustrator so what we're going to do is we're going to draw abraham lincoln [Music] in my life i discovered that many things need to be taken step by step so i want you to work with your kids and your fellow teachers and your parents on how to draw and it all starts with the letter c we're gonna do a letter c right here now the trick is when you're doing this you make sound effects like i do while i'm sitting at home in my cartoonish studio next up we're going to do the letter u a giant u shape press like that and then all we need is a straight little line so there's an eye a c and a u i can see you drawing through this camera next up we're gonna do a little line straight across for his hat we're gonna add that little line so abraham lincoln used to have like a stove pipe hat really tall hat so we're gonna do a couple little lines on either side next up two more simple line now for fun since the hat is really tall we're going to go right up off the page i want to see you guys draw those lines right up off the page now we're gonna start with numbers the number three will be the hair how does three become hair just like this and we've got hair and then we're gonna do another three on the other side for more hair next up i'm gonna give you a trivia question how did abraham lincoln smell if you said with his nose you're right his nose is a backwards c oink and then we're going to do two little dots for eyes [Music] give him some eyebrows [Music] a big old smile and then of course abraham lincoln when he was 11 did not have a beard but we're a cartoonist so we're going to draw him with a beard a bunch of u-shapes and there you have it abraham lincoln just for you try it at home share with your friends and families

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can infer that a similar question is implied in Question 4: "Why did Abraham Lincoln stand up to the boys who were torturing turtles?" 

However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about how the boys were hurting the turtles, which is not present in the provided list.

If I had to choose from the existing list, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

Index: 4 (Please note that this is not a direct match, but rather an inference based on the content of the transcript.)

animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local

every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly listed. However, based on the content of the transcript, I can infer that the closest match would be a question related to how Abraham Lincoln taught himself.

Since there isn't a direct match, I will provide a suggestion for a generated MCQ that could be similar to the ground truth MCQ:

Question: How did Abraham Lincoln teach himself since he didn't have a chance to go to school?
Options: A. Writing the alphabet on the wall of his cabin., B. Writing the alphabet in the dirt., C. Writing the alphabet on trees., D. Both B and C.

This question is not among the generated MCQs, but it would be the closest match to the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to pick one that is vaguely related to Lincoln's education, I would suggest:

Question 3: What was Abraham Lincoln's favorite thing to do when he was a child? Options: A. Playing with his friends, B. Reading books, C. Hunting animals, D. Working on the farm

This question is not a direct match, but it is related to Lincoln's childhood and his interests, which could be tangentially related to how he taught himself. However, please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would be a question that directly addresses how Lincoln taught himself.

Index of the weak match: 3

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ is about how Lincoln stood up to Jack Armstrong, and the correct answer is that they had a wrestling match.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions that Abraham Lincoln stood up to the boys who were torturing turtles, but it does not mention Jack Armstrong or a wrestling match.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions a wrestling match between Lincoln and Jack Armstrong. Based on this information, I would suggest that a new generated MCQ could be created to match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, although it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Question 4 asks why Abraham Lincoln stood up to the boys who were torturing turtles, and one of the options mentions that he was a strong and brave boy. However, this is not the same as the ground truth MCQ, which asks how Lincoln stood up to Jack Armstrong.

Therefore, I would not recommend any of the existing generated MCQs as a direct match for the ground truth MCQ. Instead, I would suggest creating a new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the wrestling match between Lincoln and Jack Armstrong.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, although it is not a direct match.

Index: 4 (Note: This is not a direct match, and a new generated MCQ should be created to match the ground truth MCQ.)

turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my

elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be

elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be

Reviewer: Morton Bast So, when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand, and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things, like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid, but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of, really, a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake. So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter, and this progressively made the shake worse, so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely. But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line, and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?" So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great. And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas, or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time, I was finishing up school, and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck, I got myself to the art store, and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day, and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create. And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness, I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back, I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered, could you become more creative, then, by looking for limitations? What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies? At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in -- well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks — but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one, so I decided to ask for 50. Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest? So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time, one on top of another, with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter) So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. (Laughter) (Applause) Or, what if instead of relying on myself, I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art? So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout, and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. (Applause) Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it? This seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches. (Laughter) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials, like spitting out food -- (Laughter) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles, then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation, as each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections. And in return, I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art, away from my dream, just going through the motions, instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream, I just quit, I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake? Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life, and having life skills. Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now, when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities, like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image, using a pushpin to tattoo a banana, or painting a picture with hamburger grease. (Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. (Applause)

And what if I didn't embrace the shake? Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life, and having life skills. Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now, when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities, like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image, using a pushpin to tattoo a banana, or painting a picture with hamburger grease. (Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

You know much like buildings, text especially informational and nonfiction texts have to be structurally sound or else When you read informational texts you see the pattern in the way that its written. yeah There are five main structures you can check. Find the structure and they get less complex. Let's flex and break down all five. Follow me, the Text Structure Mastermind. This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast. It explains how things are different in the same with the words in bold I'm about to say both the tower of Pisa's construction and the Washington monument saw disruption. The Washington monument, Named after George, had constuction paused for the Civil War. But the purposes of the buildings were different One was erected as a church bell tower while the other honored a Founding Father There we compared the two differenct structures thats five text structures in 1/16 of an hour In text, I find description, sequence, cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day In text I find description I find sequence cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day. There's a problem and solution I bet

Find the structure and they get less complex. Let's flex and break down all five. Follow me, the Text Structure Mastermind. This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 6, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 9
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than

it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared

this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This octopus is making a quick escape… with the help of its suckers. The suckers are incredibly strong. And while we only have two hands to grab things,
an octopus holds on with hundreds of suckers running up and down each arm. Suckers come in pretty handy to get around. Or to grab a bite to eat. Or to hang onto your keeper’s arm. So how do suckers stick so well? It’s not super glue. It’s water pressure. Each sucker has a ring called an infundibulum. It creates a water-tight seal. Inside the sucker there’s a chamber, like
a cup, called the acetabulum. It’s full of water. When the octopus expands the chamber, it lowers
the pressure inside. The higher pressure outside pushes against
the sucker creating a powerful grip. Suckers get such a workout that their skin
sloughs off every few weeks. See that ring-shaped piece of skin floating
by? It used to be the bottom of a sucker. Suckers have another super-power. They actually can smell and taste. That helps the octopus tell there’s no snail
inside this shell. Hundreds of suckers tasting and smelling,
and flexible arms moving every which way, create a huge amount of information -- a lot
for the octopus’ central brain to process. So each arm has a mind of its own. In fact, two thirds of an octopus’ neurons
are in its arms. That means the central brain isn’t really
calling all the shots. The central brain tells the arms how fast
to move. But the instructions on how to reach come
from each arm. It’s a nifty way to process all that information,
making the octopus the well-choreographed creature we know. AMY: Hi. This is Amy Standen. You may have noticed a different voice on

**Transcript**:
India and China, together, are home to over
2.7 billion people. That's as many humans as in the next 20 most
populous countries combined, or in the whole other 170 countries in the world. Over the last 300 years, India and China each
added more than a billion people to their populations, way more than any other country,
but they have actually been growing at about the same rate as the rest of the world. They have a lot more people today because
they had a lot more people a few hundred years ago, when the world began its period of modern,
and rapid, population growth. It's like comparing a big bank account and
a small one. If they both grow at about the same rate over
many years, the big one gains a lot more money, simply because it started with more. So the billion-dollar, er, billion-person
question, is why did India and China have so many people when they started their rapid
growth? We can’t know for sure, since so many variables
factor into long-term population dynamics, but the two most plausible explanations are
food and area. Having lots of fertile land and good access
to fresh water makes it possible to grow lots of food, which in turn makes it possible to
nourish a lot of people. Even today, the 10 most populated countries
in the world all have a relatively large amount of farmland. And Asia - and in particular south and east
Asia - has tons of farmland, lots of river valleys, and the ability to grow food year-round. Plus, domestication of plants and animals
essentially started in Asia, giving populations an early leg - or wing - up. As such, Asia’s been the most densely populated
region of the world for a really long time. Area matters too; countries like Pakistan
and Bangladesh may be filled with farms and densely-populated, but because they’re smaller
in area than India and China, they simply cannot contain as many people. Of course, a few other things happened in
India and China in the last few thousand years, and some of them helped the populations grow,
and some of them shrank the populations, but through it all, the large and fertile lands
of India and China were able to sustain lots of people, such that when the era of modern
population growth came around, they had a head start. Or rather, a hundred-million-head start. This video was sponsored by the University

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the

this is all here all the lightsabers that were in our house i like this no not those no not harry potter's broom no we'll get sued for that anyway oh here it is tada that was acting by the way i am abraham lincoln the reason i wrote this book is you know as i always say that the lesson in every one of these books is always on the back so it's i am abraham lincoln by my favorite author brad meltzer my favorite illustrator chris eliopoulos who is our amazing artist um on the back it says the lesson i will always speak my mind and speak for others and so um one of the things that you're going to see in this one is this is going to focus for you who are xavier riddle fans is dr zoom can you believe it edina has a stuffed doctor zoom i have a stuffed abraham lincoln that's right i do so we're gonna learn um and dr zoom is gonna play a major role in this book uh you scream yell when you see him uh or her i should say and this is i am abraham lincoln by brad meltzer and christopher elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be forgotten look he's on the penny i am abraham lincoln i will never stop fighting for what's right and i hope you remember that when you speak your mind and speak for others there's no more powerful way to be heard and that is the end of i am abraham lincoln and as always i'm going to take some questions that you guys have sent me um and let's see some good questions here uh it says are all those lightsabers yours they are all ours i told you you think i'm making this up they're all ours now by the way someone said we got this right where is dr zoom did you miss it come on the turtle look

i am benjamin franklin we're doing i am anne frank and i'm not going to tell you who's after that because it's a surprise on xavier riddle you're going to see i'm not supposed to say anything i'm not supposed to talk about it they told me not to tell anyone who's coming that is coming soon on xavier riddle i never said it see pbs kids i never said it abraham lincoln's coming see i didn't even say that that wasn't me it was it was him that's who did it anyway my name is brad meltzer thank you for tuning in we still do not have a crayon utility belt like brad wears his crayon utility belt on xavier rail but again i promise you i will get a crayon utility belt it is coming i determined to find one um thank you for joining us and let me entertain your kids today in this these crazy times keep reading keep reading the most important keep being nice to each other [Music] hi everybody i'm chris eliopoulos i'm the co-creator of xavier riddle and the secret museum on pbs kids i'm also a cartoonist illustrator so what we're going to do is we're going to draw abraham lincoln [Music] in my life i discovered that many things need to be taken step by step so i want you to work with your kids and your fellow teachers and your parents on how to draw and it all starts with the letter c we're gonna do a letter c right here now the trick is when you're doing this you make sound effects like i do while i'm sitting at home in my cartoonish studio next up we're going to do the letter u a giant u shape press like that and then all we need is a straight little line so there's an eye a c and a u i can see you drawing through this camera next up we're gonna do a little line straight across for his hat we're gonna add that little line so abraham lincoln used to have like a stove pipe hat really tall hat so we're gonna do a couple little lines on either side next up two more simple line now for fun since the hat is really tall we're going to go right up off the page i want to see you guys draw those lines right up off the page now we're gonna start with numbers the number three will be the hair how does three become hair just like this and we've got hair and then we're gonna do another three on the other side for more hair next up i'm gonna give you a trivia question how did abraham lincoln smell if you said with his nose you're right his nose is a backwards c oink and then we're going to do two little dots for eyes [Music] give him some eyebrows [Music] a big old smile and then of course abraham lincoln when he was 11 did not have a beard but we're a cartoonist so

see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be forgotten look he's on the penny i am abraham lincoln i will never stop fighting for what's right and i hope you remember that when you speak your mind and speak for others there's no more powerful

elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to

every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this

hi i'm brad meltzer welcome to story time number two this one is i am abraham lincoln our goal is to give your kids better heroes to look up to teach them lessons of kindness and compassion especially today we need it uh especially in our leaders so we are going to start i have the book right here let me just find it here way this joke is running so long and notice that these are all by the way this is all here all the lightsabers that were in our house i like this no not those no not harry potter's broom no we'll get sued for that anyway oh here it is tada that was acting by the way i am abraham lincoln the reason i wrote this book is you know as i always say that the lesson in every one of these books is always on the back so it's i am abraham lincoln by my favorite author brad meltzer my favorite illustrator chris eliopoulos who is our amazing artist um on the back it says the lesson i will always speak my mind and speak for others and so um one of the things that you're going to see in this one is this is going to focus for you who are xavier riddle fans is dr zoom can you believe it edina has a stuffed doctor zoom i have a stuffed abraham lincoln that's right i do so we're gonna learn um and dr zoom is gonna play a major role in this book uh you scream yell when you see him uh or her i should say and this is i am abraham lincoln by brad meltzer and christopher elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be forgotten look he's on the penny i am abraham lincoln i will never stop fighting for what's right and i hope you remember that when you speak your mind and speak for others there's no more powerful way to be heard and that is the end of i am abraham lincoln and as always i'm going to take some questions that you guys have sent me um and let's see some good questions here uh it says are all those lightsabers yours they are all ours i told you you think i'm making this up they're all ours now by the way someone said we got this right where is dr zoom did you miss it come on the turtle look

**Transcript**:
hi i'm brad meltzer welcome to story time number two this one is i am abraham lincoln our goal is to give your kids better heroes to look up to teach them lessons of kindness and compassion especially today we need it uh especially in our leaders so we are going to start i have the book right here let me just find it here way this joke is running so long and notice that these are all by the way this is all here all the lightsabers that were in our house i like this no not those no not harry potter's broom no we'll get sued for that anyway oh here it is tada that was acting by the way i am abraham lincoln the reason i wrote this book is you know as i always say that the lesson in every one of these books is always on the back so it's i am abraham lincoln by my favorite author brad meltzer my favorite illustrator chris eliopoulos who is our amazing artist um on the back it says the lesson i will always speak my mind and speak for others and so um one of the things that you're going to see in this one is this is going to focus for you who are xavier riddle fans is dr zoom can you believe it edina has a stuffed doctor zoom i have a stuffed abraham lincoln that's right i do so we're gonna learn um and dr zoom is gonna play a major role in this book uh you scream yell when you see him uh or her i should say and this is i am abraham lincoln by brad meltzer and christopher elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your voice when you find something you believe in use your voice and when you've seen justice speak louder than you've ever spoken before when you do it'll never be forgotten look he's on the penny i am abraham lincoln i will never stop fighting for what's right and i hope you remember that when you speak your mind and speak for others there's no more powerful way to be heard and that is the end of i am abraham lincoln and as always i'm going to take some questions that you guys have sent me um and let's see some good questions here uh it says are all those lightsabers yours they are all ours i told you you think i'm making this up they're all ours now by the way someone said we got this right where is dr zoom did you miss it come on the turtle look there's a turtle on this page hint hint dr zoom dr zoom look our favorite dr zoom oh i like this question who is coming next oh that's a good question okay so let's see if i haven't had oh wait you know what this is why i love okay ready so you've seen obviously we have i'm abraham lincoln the next one that's coming is right here i am leonardo da vinci he's coming and then after that we're doing i am benjamin franklin we're doing i am anne frank and i'm not going to tell you who's after that because it's a surprise on xavier riddle you're going to see i'm not supposed to say anything i'm not supposed to talk about it they told me not to tell anyone who's coming that is coming soon on xavier riddle i never said it see pbs kids i never said it abraham lincoln's coming see i didn't even say that that wasn't me it was it was him that's who did it anyway my name is brad meltzer thank you for tuning in we still do not have a crayon utility belt like brad wears his crayon utility belt on xavier rail but again i promise you i will get a crayon utility belt it is coming i determined to find one um thank you for joining us and let me entertain your kids today in this these crazy times keep reading keep reading the most important keep being nice to each other [Music] hi everybody i'm chris eliopoulos i'm the co-creator of xavier riddle and the secret museum on pbs kids i'm also a cartoonist illustrator so what we're going to do is we're going to draw abraham lincoln [Music] in my life i discovered that many things need to be taken step by step so i want you to work with your kids and your fellow teachers and your parents on how to draw and it all starts with the letter c we're gonna do a letter c right here now the trick is when you're doing this you make sound effects like i do while i'm sitting at home in my cartoonish studio next up we're going to do the letter u a giant u shape press like that and then all we need is a straight little line so there's an eye a c and a u i can see you drawing through this camera next up we're gonna do a little line straight across for his hat we're gonna add that little line so abraham lincoln used to have like a stove pipe hat really tall hat so we're gonna do a couple little lines on either side next up two more simple line now for fun since the hat is really tall we're going to go right up off the page i want to see you guys draw those lines right up off the page now we're gonna start with numbers the number three will be the hair how does three become hair just like this and we've got hair and then we're gonna do another three on the other side for more hair next up i'm gonna give you a trivia question how did abraham lincoln smell if you said with his nose you're right his nose is a backwards c oink and then we're going to do two little dots for eyes [Music] give him some eyebrows [Music] a big old smile and then of course abraham lincoln when he was 11 did not have a beard but we're a cartoonist so we're going to draw him with a beard a bunch of u-shapes and there you have it abraham lincoln just for you try it at home share with your friends and families

**Transcript**:
Translator: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast So, when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand, and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things, like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid, but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of, really, a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake. So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter, and this progressively made the shake worse, so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely. But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line, and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?" So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great. And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas, or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time, I was finishing up school, and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck, I got myself to the art store, and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day, and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create. And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness, I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back, I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered, could you become more creative, then, by looking for limitations? What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies? At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in -- well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks — but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one, so I decided to ask for 50. Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest? So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time, one on top of another, with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter) So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. (Laughter) (Applause) Or, what if instead of relying on myself, I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art? So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout, and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. (Applause) Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it? This seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches. (Laughter) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials, like spitting out food -- (Laughter) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles, then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation, as each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections. And in return, I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art, away from my dream, just going through the motions, instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream, I just quit, I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake? Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life, and having life skills. Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now, when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities, like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image, using a pushpin to tattoo a banana, or painting a picture with hamburger grease. (Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. (Applause)

It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections. And in return, I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art, away from my dream, just going through the motions, instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream, I just quit, I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake? Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life, and having life skills. Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now, when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities, like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image, using a pushpin to tattoo a banana, or painting a picture with hamburger grease. (Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Translator: Joseph Geni
Reviewer: Morton Bast So, when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand, and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things, like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid, but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of, really, a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake. So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter, and this progressively made the shake worse, so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely. But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line, and said, "Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?" So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great. And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas, or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time, I was finishing up school, and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck, I got myself to the art store, and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day, and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create. And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness, I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back, I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered, could you become more creative, then, by looking for limitations? What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies? At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in -- well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks — but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one, so I decided to ask for 50. Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest? So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time, one on top of another, with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter) So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. (Laughter) (Applause) Or, what if instead of relying on myself, I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art? So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout, and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. (Applause) Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it? This seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches. (Laughter) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials, like spitting out food -- (Laughter) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles, then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation, as each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections.
