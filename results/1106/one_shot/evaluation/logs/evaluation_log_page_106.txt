**Transcript**:
What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what lies beyond the outer rim of the donut, and the correct answer is ecological destruction. Question 9 asks about the "inner limit", but it also mentions the concept of a limit, which is related to the idea of the outer rim of the donut. However, none of the options in Question 9 directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 9, but with a note that it is not a direct match.

in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means
to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies
like test kits, masks to deter the spread 
of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make
sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage
and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help
and comfort those who need it most.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar.

Question 2 asks about the time period when the iconic plague doctor emerged on the scene, and the passage mentions that the plague occurred in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th, and 19th centuries. While not directly related, both questions deal with the historical context of the plague.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest.

However, Question 3 mentions the purpose of the herbs and compounds in the plague doctor's beak, which is related to the ingredients.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar, I would suggest Question 3. However, please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs do not have an exact equivalent to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means
to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies
like test kits, masks to deter the spread 
of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make
sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage
and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help
and comfort those who need it most.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules 
to construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to
combine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins
that attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules
into layers. The specific arrangement of these protein
scaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity 
of shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components 
of their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 
at the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce 
two crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have 
the same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way
their crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two 
and less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have 
a sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt 
to more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have 
an interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger
and more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material
by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules 
to construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to
combine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins
that attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules
into layers. The specific arrangement of these protein
scaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity 
of shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components 
of their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 
at the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce 
two crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have 
the same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way
their crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two 
and less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have 
a sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt 
to more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have 
an interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger
and more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material
by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the closest match would be Question 3, as it mentions the process of mollusks creating their shells, which involves the organ that secretes the shell's scaffold.

However, since Question 3 does not directly ask about the name of the organ, it is not a perfect match. If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar enough to be considered a match.

But if I really had to choose, I would say Question 3 is the closest, but it would be more accurate to say that a new question should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

**Transcript**:
The Black Death. The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time 
without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people
was just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than
a COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after 
the 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing
a similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways 
to answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers 
who took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics 
and pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood 
that an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world 
over a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood
that that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage
of the world's population. This graph shows that while huge
pandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions
to estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic 
is about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge 
more frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way
to estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,
which is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by
making contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries
and infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given
spillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, 
how often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, 
existing immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates 
to cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about
1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model
using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

**Transcript**:
The Black Death. The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time 
without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people
was just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than
a COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after 
the 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing
a similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways 
to answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers 
who took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics 
and pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood 
that an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world 
over a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood
that that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage
of the world's population. This graph shows that while huge
pandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions
to estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic 
is about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge 
more frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way
to estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,
which is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by
making contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries
and infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given
spillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, 
how often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, 
existing immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates 
to cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about
1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model
using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 4 does not cover the full scope of the ground truth MCQ, I continued to analyze the generated MCQs. Questions 5 and 6 also touch on the concept of moral status but do not fully match the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the options and the overall intent of the ground truth MCQ, I found that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match it. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, but with significant differences.

If I had to choose another question that might be related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 5 is also relevant, as it discusses the idea that moral status comes in degrees, which is part of the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What complicates the decision of sacrificing monkeys to save human lives, according to the transcript?**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and options of Question 9 are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the risks associated with smallpox research through animal experimentation, and Question 9 touches on the uncertainty of the research, which is a key aspect of the risk.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 9, but with some reservations.

If I were to modify Question 9 to make it more similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would rephrase it to:

**Question 9: What are the risks associated with using animals in smallpox research?**

Options: A. Uncertainty of whether the research will lead to improved medical care., B. The virus that causes smallpox could be weaponized by bad actors., C. Animals will be harmed without guaranteed benefits., D. Both A and C.

This revised question would more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

- A blood moon lunar eclipse
wasn't always something to look forward to. When the moon turned red thousands of years ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared
that something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts and since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, and the moon returns to normal afterward, they
were probably convinced that their whooping and
howling actually worked. We know now that the moon
doesn't need our protection, but why does it turn
red in the first place? (peaceful music) Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface, so if something were
to block that sunlight say, the earth, then in theory, the moon should disappear from view but during a total lunar eclipse when the moon passes
through the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface. This is a NASA simulation
of what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that
ring is either a sunrise or a sunset, and while
it's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's
atmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of
light around the planet, so that redness you see
during a blood moon eclipse is a combination of
light from every sunrise and sunset on earth,
all happening at once. So the moon appears
red for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red because of a phenomenon
called Rayleigh Scattering. Named after the British
physicist, John William Strutt, also known as Lord
Rayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different
colors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere. Look at the sky during
daytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter
blue light more easily than red, but during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through
more of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye
which has two consequences. First, it means more overall
sunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily
gaze upon the sun at sunset compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering
means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the
redder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels
through a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So rather than fear a blood
moon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think
of it as a romantic moment? After all, it's the only time
when you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously. (peaceful music)

**Transcript**:
This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, based on the topic of hemagglutinin proteins and their role in facilitating a viral infection, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match.

Although Question 3 does not directly ask about the function of hemagglutinin proteins, it does relate to the concept of antigenic drift, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ's explanation. Nevertheless, it's essential to acknowledge that the generated MCQs do not accurately represent the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, but with the understanding that it's not a direct match.

However, a new question is needed to match the ground truth MCQ accurately. Here is an example:

New Question: How do hemagglutinin proteins facilitate a viral infection?
Options: A. They fuse the viral and human membranes., B. They rapidly replicate in the presence of human cells., C. They attack the antibodies with which they come into close contact., D. They change shape to prevent recognition by the body’s immune system.

This new question directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs do not address the analogy between the virus's hemagglutinin and the bust of Napoleon.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is vaguely related to the concept of hemagglutinin, I would say Question 5, but it's a stretch. Question 5 asks about the name of the protein that is used to store and move iron, but can also be engineered to present viral proteins to the immune system. While this question is related to the topic of viral proteins, it does not address the specific analogy between hemagglutinin and the bust of Napoleon.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically addresses the analogy between hemagglutinin and the bust of Napoleon would be needed.

Index: None

which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of US property that is privately owned. The closest generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks about who owns the capital in a capitalist economy. Although the question is not exactly the same, it touches on the idea of ownership, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must note that the options in Question 3 do not provide a specific percentage, which is the main focus of the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, the similarity is limited.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low degree of similarity.

Index: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ should be generated to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,
while others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead 
to partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote
deeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,
and operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— 
like stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea 
and restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate 
these factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, 
such as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient 
sleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend 
safety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing 
door alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider
certain medications. But many of the available treatments
for sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective
they are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do 
if you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing
a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them
can cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be 
to gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure
they’re safe until the episode resolves.

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,
while others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead 
to partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote
deeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,
and operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— 
like stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea 
and restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate 
these factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, 
such as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient 
sleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend 
safety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing 
door alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider
certain medications. But many of the available treatments
for sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective
they are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do 
if you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing
a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them
can cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be 
to gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure
they’re safe until the episode resolves.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes
in our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic
antiviral CRISPR in human cells. Or, for short, PAC-MAN.

system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional

a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you

that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune

30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus

for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes
in our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic
antiviral CRISPR in human cells. Or, for short, PAC-MAN.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: What is one of the challenges in developing antiviral drugs to treat the common cold?**

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the challenges of developing treatments for viruses, which is the underlying theme of the ground truth MCQ. However, a closer examination of the options reveals that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

A closer match can be found in the transcript, where it is mentioned that "HIV mutates so quickly that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory, be produced in a single day." This is similar to the ground truth MCQ, which states that HIV mutates much faster than smallpox.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly capture this concept. However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose:

**Question 6 is not a good match, but Question 7 has some relation to the topic of virus mutation and challenges in developing treatments. However, a new question is generated based on the content of Question 6.**

Let's rephrase Question 6 to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ:

**New Question: Why did the vaccine for smallpox succeed, while the vaccine for HIV has been challenging to develop?**

Since this new question is not among the original generated MCQs, I will choose the closest match based on the original questions.

**Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7 (Note: This is not a direct match, but rather a related question. A direct match could not be found among the generated MCQs.)**

However, I can generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

**New Question: What is one reason scientists have been able to develop an effective vaccine for smallpox, but not for HIV?**

Options: A. Smallpox has a slower mutation rate compared to HIV., B. Smallpox is less contagious than HIV., C. The success of HIV drugs has made a vaccine unnecessary., D. HIV has a slower mutation rate compared to smallpox.

Correct Option: A

This new question is a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs

the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

**Transcript**:
Everyone loves the idea of parallel universes
- maybe it's the appeal of an ideal world where you have second chances and things turn
out differently - an alternate reality where you do get into Hogwarts and the Star Wars
prequels aren't made and you finally plug in your asymmetric computer cord correctly
on the first try... but is there really a place in science for such wistful speculation? I mean, if "the universe" is everything that
there is, you can't have two versions of it, right? Otherwise the pair would really be everything
and what you started off calling the universe, wasn't. The problem here is terminology: physicists
speaking informally often say "universe" when they really mean "observable universe" - that
is, the part of the whole universe that we've so far been able to see. And it's perfectly fine to talk about multiple
different observable universes - for example, an alien near the edge of OUR observable universe
will see parts of the Whole Universe that we cannot yet see, but that's a well-understood
question and not what physicists normally talk about when they discuss multiple observable
universes, or "multi-verses." So let's cut to the chase: in physics, the
word "Multiverse" normally refers to one of three distinct and largely unrelated proposed
physical models for the universe - none of which has been tested or confirmed by experiment,
by the way. The three "multiverse" models are: Type 1) Bubble universes or baby black hole
universes. This is the most straightforward kind of multiverse:
the basic idea is that perhaps there are other parts of the universe which are so far away
that we will never see them (or are inside black holes so similarly we will never see
them). This kind of model was created as an attempt
to explain why our universe is so good at making stars and galaxies and black holes
and life - as the argument goes, if each of these separate mutually un-seeable "bubbles"
in the universe had slightly different laws of physics, then by definition we could only
exist in one that had the right physical laws to allow us to exist. If you're not convinced by this logic, don't
worry too much: there's not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 2) Membranes and extra dimensions. Inspired in part by the inability of the mathematics
of string theory to predict the right number of dimensions for the universe in which we
live, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is
actually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with
9 spatial dimensions. Kind of like how each page of a newspaper
is its own two-dimensional surface embedded within our three-dimensional world. And of course, if space had 9 dimensions rather
than three, there'd be plenty of space for other three-dimensional surfaces that appeared,
like ours, to be universes in their own right, but, like the pages of a newspaper, were actually
part of a bigger whole. These kinds of surfaces are called "membranes"
or "branes" for short. And as a reminder, there is not yet any experimental
evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 3) The many-worlds picture
of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, physicists still don't fully
understand how the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics happens, and the many-worlds
hypothesis makes an attempt at explanation by proposing that every possible alternate
timeline for the universe is real and they all happen in an ever-larger, ever-branching
way. Like, a universal choose-your-own-adventure
where every possible story happens! If this were the case, we might not realize
it because we'd be stuck living out just one of the infinitely many possible lives available
to us. In some ways, many-worlds is similar to the
bubble multiverse model by proposing "maybe anything that can happen, does. And we just happen to exist in the series
of happenings that were necessary for us to exist." If you're still not convinced by this logic,
don't worry: there is not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Of course if you want to get imaginative,
you could also combine several of these models together into a multi-multiverse... a new
super-speculative model based, itself, on speculative and experimentally unconfirmed
models. But that's not to say we couldn't test these
multiverse hypotheses. For example, if our observable universe were
really just one of many disconnected bubbles or membranes and if it happened to collide
with another bubble or membrane some time in the past, then that collision would certainly
have had some sort of effect on what we see when we look up at the night sky. On the other hand, the many-worlds interpretation
might be tested fairly soon since experimentalists are becoming increasingly able to manipulate
and control ever-larger quantum mechanical systems in their labs - systems that approach
the line between the quantum realm and our everyday experience. So as always, we must remember that physics
is science, not philosophy; and in our attempts to explain the universe that we observe, we
have to make claims that can in principle be tested - and then test them!

**Transcript**:
On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser
flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than 
five decades in the making. The power grids 
of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine
stretching coast to coast. Today, the US power grid is the
world's largest machine. It contains more than 7,300 
electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of 
powerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth’s continents,
transmitting electricity around the clock. They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends
on a delicate balance. Their components must always
work in unison, maintain a constant frequency
throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there's too much electricity
in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can
overheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity 
and you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid
from sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand 
and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output 
up or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the 
availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy
sources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy 
from the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are
ordered by price. Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower
production costs. Some grids, like those 
in Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy. But most dispatch curves contain
more of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting
energy sources. This means that where your electricity
is coming from— and how clean it is— 
varies throughout the day— as often as every few minutes. Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting 
power plants. This is because wind energy is especially
plentiful at night. But, this is also when 
there’s lower demand. So, Kansas’s wind energy 
is actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity 
from damaging the grid. And comparable scenarios
add up to a big problem worldwide. Thankfully, dependence on renewables
is rising. But power grids are often unable
to make full use of them. Many simply weren't designed around
intermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts
of electricity. Researchers are experimenting 
with unique storage solutions. However, this will take time
and substantial investment. But hope is not lost. We have the opportunity to work with
our existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean 
electricity to spare. Leaning into this concept,
called “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid
and reduce the need for non-renewables. So researchers are developing 
automated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity 
from the grid at the cleanest times. In fact, smart devices 
like this already exist. So, how big an effect could they have? If smart technologies like
air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were 
implemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could 
decrease by around 20%. In other words, simply coordinating
when certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons 
of carbon released into the atmosphere 
annually from Texas alone. Now, imagine what this could look
like on a global scale.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the approximate number of electricity-generating plants in the United States. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 2 talks about the approximate number of kilometers of powerlines, transformers, and substations in the US power grid. This question is related to the scale and scope of the US power grid, similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question that could potentially be modified to match the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2. But please note that this is a stretch, and the actual content of Question 2 is quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 2 is the closest match, but with significant modifications needed to match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: 2 (with significant modifications needed)

**Transcript**:
Shielded from the gorgon’s 
stone-cold gaze, Perseus crept through Medusa’s cave. When he reached her, 
he took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, 
a giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,
white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What was the name of the magnificent, white, winged horse born from Medusa's neck? 

However, the options provided in Question 3 do not directly answer the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a question that asks about the parentage of Pegasus. 

Since there is no direct match, the closest generated MCQ is Question 2: What creature was born from Medusa's neck after her beheading? 

This question is related to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions Medusa and the birth of creatures from her neck. However, it does not specifically ask about Pegasus' parentage.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about Pegasus' parentage, but such a question is not available in the provided options.

Considering the available options, I would choose Question 2 as the closest match, but with the understanding that it is not a direct match.

white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

**Transcript**:
Today is the one year anniversary 
of the best-worst day of your life. The best part was discovering
a subterranean city on Mars: the first evidence of intelligent 
alien life ever found. The worst part? No one got to explore it, because that was when you lost contact
with Earth. You and the other 99 scientists
have spent the rest of the year engineering your survival, but you’re almost out of water 
and solutions. Everyone else is at the ice cap, but you’ve decided to investigate
the buried city to see if there are clues to how their
civilization survived on a desert planet. The city is mostly ruins 
except for three intact pyramids— two open and one sealed. In the first you find a series 
of symbols and pictograms, revealing a fortuitously 
base 10 numbering system. The second pyramid’s facade 
is covered in these symbols. Inside you discover a device, as well as mosaic representations
of how to use it. From those you glean the following: the device is the key to opening 
the sealed pyramid by inputting the number 
on the center block. But if you put in the wrong number,
something terrible and deadly will happen. The doors to all pyramids work
on the same principle. What number should you input to open
the door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second
pyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers
directly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,
40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7
and an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined
by trial and error, but it’s quicker to use
algebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center
number is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, 
is equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, 
making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: Why did the Martian civilization move all the water underground? Options: A. To make the planet more habitable., B. To make the planet less habitable to others., C. To create a giant engineering marvel., D. To preserve the planet's natural resources.

However, this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks "Where are the Martians?" The closest match is not perfect, but Question 6 does relate to the actions of the Martians, which is the closest connection to the ground truth MCQ.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the location or fate of the Martians. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 6, but with a note that it's not a perfect match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the information provided in the transcript, the closest match can be determined by looking for a generated MCQ that involves Jupiter or its characteristics.

Generated MCQ 5 asks about the number of confirmed moons Jupiter has, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ but is about Jupiter. However, Generated MCQ 3 mentions a characteristic of Jupiter (the frequency of its opposition), and Generated MCQ 4 mentions the distance between Earth and Jupiter at its closest approach.

However, since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the biggest planet in our solar system, the closest match can be considered as the one that mentions a characteristic of Jupiter that can be linked to its size or significance.

Considering the intent of the ground truth MCQ, which is to identify the biggest planet in our solar system, and the information provided in the transcript, the closest match would be Generated MCQ 4, as it mentions a characteristic of Jupiter (its distance from Earth at its closest approach), but it does not directly answer the ground truth MCQ.

However, since the options of Generated MCQ 4 do not include any other planets for comparison, it's not an ideal match.

A more suitable match can be Generated MCQ 3, as it's not directly related to the size of Jupiter, but since the opposition of a planet can be an indicator of its visibility, which can be linked to its size, and the fact that the transcript mentions that "Jupiter is the brightest planet in the sky after Venus," this might give an indirect indication of the size or significance of the planet.

However, the best match is still not ideal, as the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of the ground truth MCQ.

Considering the available options, I would choose Generated MCQ 5 as the closest match, as it directly addresses a characteristic of Jupiter (the number of its moons), which can be an indicator of the planet's size or significance.

**Transcript**:
There's a grocery store
in Brooklyn, New York, with sales per square foot 4 times 
as high as any other grocery store in the area. 10,000 people work there,
and it doesn’t have a CEO. This place is the Park Slope Food Co-op, and it’s one of 3 million cooperatives,
or co-ops for short, around the world. Co-ops are a big part 
of the global economy: they employ 280 million people—
10% of the world’s workforce and the equivalent of over $2 trillion
flow through their doors every year. How is it possible that a business 
with 10,000 workers doesn’t have a CEO? To answer that, we have to talk about what
a co-op is and why they were founded. Let’s rewind to 1844. A group of 28 weavers in Rochdale, England came together to create 
and co-own a store. By buying in bulk directly from suppliers,
they could negotiate prices, which allowed all of them to buy stuff
they couldn't otherwise afford. They ran the store collectively
and democratically, which was remarkable at the time. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers
wasn't the world's first co-op, but it was the first to publicize 
its principles— principles that guide co-ops to this day. Today, there are all kinds of co-ops: REI in the US and S-Group in Finland
are large consumer co-ops. Credit unions and mutual insurance
companies are financial sector co-ops. And when farmers or other producers come
together, that's a producer co-op. And then there are worker co-ops, like Mondragon in Spain or 
The Cheeseboard in Berkeley, California, which are founded to provide jobs
to people in the community. Some consumer co-ops, like Park Slope, require their members to work shifts 
in the store. In exchange for their work, members pay 
15 to 50% less for groceries, and they influence what products
are— or aren’t— sold there. Three crucial things to know about co-ops: first, all co-ops are jointly
owned by their members, whether those members are consumers,
producers, workers, or whoever. Unlike traditional companies, 
which can have outside shareholders, all owners of a co-op are also members. Second, co-ops are not founded
to maximize profit. Many do turn a significant profit, 
but that’s not their core mission. So evaluating a co-op purely 
by traditional business metrics ignores the most important reason
for their existence: how well do they serve their members? And third: co-ops are controlled
democratically by their members. But how do decisions get made? It varies. At a small worker co-op
like The Cheeseboard, day-to-day operational decisions
are just made by the workers. As co-ops get larger, they do institute
some form of leadership or management. Park Slope has a general manager 
who leads the 80 or so employees. And the largest network of worker 
and consumer co-ops in the world, Mondragon, has a president 
and managers who lead the roughly 30,000 worker-owners 
and 50,000 contract workers. But leadership roles in a co-op are very
different than in a traditional company. The leadership implements policies
that its members or worker-owners have agreed upon, by vote. And at Mondragon workers, 
can vote to fire the president. At a co-op, there’s no single person with overarching, top-down power 
over everyone else, like a CEO would have 
in a traditional company. Meanwhile, in both co-ops 
and traditional companies, major company-wide decisions
are made by voting. But who votes and how is wildly different. In a traditional company, voting rights 
usually come with shares of stock. The more shares you own, 
the more votes you have. Take Alphabet, 
the parent company of Google: there are thousands of shareholders, but the two founders control 51% 
of the votes and therefore the direction 
of the company. In a co-op, every member 
has the right to vote, and in most co-ops,
every member gets one vote. That difference results 
in radically different policies than you’d find at traditional companies. For example, Mondragon limits the salaries
of its management to about 6 times what the lowest paid 
worker makes. In Spain, CEOs of traditional companies 
make, on average, 143 times as much as a typical worker. At Park Slope, there’s a monthly 
general meeting, where any member can show up to vote, and a motion needs a
simple majority to pass. It then gets taken up by
the Board of directors, which is composed of co-op members,
for official approval. At The Cheeseboard, the worker-owners 
try to reach consensus on major decisions. This means that some decisions
can take a long time. For example, in the late 1970s, the workers debated whether to post
a sign outside declaring that The Cheeseboard was a collective
for one and a half years. But the extensive discussion, 
and disagreements, around that decision made it a solid one— The Cheeseboard still advertises
the fact that it’s a collective almost 50 years later. And that’s not all that’s
working well at co-ops. Studies in the UK show that co-op
start-ups are almost half as likely to close within five years
as traditional businesses. And in one study, 
researchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other
was a traditional company. The workers did similar work 
with similar salaries. The biggest difference? Co-op workers were 
about 40% happier with their jobs.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 3 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 3 only addresses one aspect of what makes a co-op (ownership), I also considered other questions that might cover the other aspects (not founded to maximize profits and democratic control). Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would select Question 3, but with the caveat that it only partially addresses the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
There's a grocery store
in Brooklyn, New York, with sales per square foot 4 times 
as high as any other grocery store in the area. 10,000 people work there,
and it doesn’t have a CEO. This place is the Park Slope Food Co-op, and it’s one of 3 million cooperatives,
or co-ops for short, around the world. Co-ops are a big part 
of the global economy: they employ 280 million people—
10% of the world’s workforce and the equivalent of over $2 trillion
flow through their doors every year. How is it possible that a business 
with 10,000 workers doesn’t have a CEO? To answer that, we have to talk about what
a co-op is and why they were founded. Let’s rewind to 1844. A group of 28 weavers in Rochdale, England came together to create 
and co-own a store. By buying in bulk directly from suppliers,
they could negotiate prices, which allowed all of them to buy stuff
they couldn't otherwise afford. They ran the store collectively
and democratically, which was remarkable at the time. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers
wasn't the world's first co-op, but it was the first to publicize 
its principles— principles that guide co-ops to this day. Today, there are all kinds of co-ops: REI in the US and S-Group in Finland
are large consumer co-ops. Credit unions and mutual insurance
companies are financial sector co-ops. And when farmers or other producers come
together, that's a producer co-op. And then there are worker co-ops, like Mondragon in Spain or 
The Cheeseboard in Berkeley, California, which are founded to provide jobs
to people in the community. Some consumer co-ops, like Park Slope, require their members to work shifts 
in the store. In exchange for their work, members pay 
15 to 50% less for groceries, and they influence what products
are— or aren’t— sold there. Three crucial things to know about co-ops: first, all co-ops are jointly
owned by their members, whether those members are consumers,
producers, workers, or whoever. Unlike traditional companies, 
which can have outside shareholders, all owners of a co-op are also members. Second, co-ops are not founded
to maximize profit. Many do turn a significant profit, 
but that’s not their core mission. So evaluating a co-op purely 
by traditional business metrics ignores the most important reason
for their existence: how well do they serve their members? And third: co-ops are controlled
democratically by their members. But how do decisions get made? It varies. At a small worker co-op
like The Cheeseboard, day-to-day operational decisions
are just made by the workers. As co-ops get larger, they do institute
some form of leadership or management. Park Slope has a general manager 
who leads the 80 or so employees. And the largest network of worker 
and consumer co-ops in the world, Mondragon, has a president 
and managers who lead the roughly 30,000 worker-owners 
and 50,000 contract workers. But leadership roles in a co-op are very
different than in a traditional company. The leadership implements policies
that its members or worker-owners have agreed upon, by vote. And at Mondragon workers, 
can vote to fire the president. At a co-op, there’s no single person with overarching, top-down power 
over everyone else, like a CEO would have 
in a traditional company. Meanwhile, in both co-ops 
and traditional companies, major company-wide decisions
are made by voting. But who votes and how is wildly different. In a traditional company, voting rights 
usually come with shares of stock. The more shares you own, 
the more votes you have. Take Alphabet, 
the parent company of Google: there are thousands of shareholders, but the two founders control 51% 
of the votes and therefore the direction 
of the company. In a co-op, every member 
has the right to vote, and in most co-ops,
every member gets one vote. That difference results 
in radically different policies than you’d find at traditional companies. For example, Mondragon limits the salaries
of its management to about 6 times what the lowest paid 
worker makes. In Spain, CEOs of traditional companies 
make, on average, 143 times as much as a typical worker. At Park Slope, there’s a monthly 
general meeting, where any member can show up to vote, and a motion needs a
simple majority to pass. It then gets taken up by
the Board of directors, which is composed of co-op members,
for official approval. At The Cheeseboard, the worker-owners 
try to reach consensus on major decisions. This means that some decisions
can take a long time. For example, in the late 1970s, the workers debated whether to post
a sign outside declaring that The Cheeseboard was a collective
for one and a half years. But the extensive discussion, 
and disagreements, around that decision made it a solid one— The Cheeseboard still advertises
the fact that it’s a collective almost 50 years later. And that’s not all that’s
working well at co-ops. Studies in the UK show that co-op
start-ups are almost half as likely to close within five years
as traditional businesses. And in one study, 
researchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other
was a traditional company. The workers did similar work 
with similar salaries. The biggest difference? Co-op workers were 
about 40% happier with their jobs.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What is the main difference between a co-op and a traditional company in terms of leadership roles?

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that Question 6 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be Question 7: How do co-ops typically handle major company-wide decisions? or Question 4: How do co-ops typically make decisions?

But the best match is actually Question 6's option B, which is mentioned in Question 7 and Question 4's option B is also related to decision-making in co-ops, but the question that really answers the ground truth MCQ is actually Question 7's option A and the fact that in traditional companies the person or people with the most shares decide which is mentioned in Question 3's option B and more specifically in the passage: "In a traditional company, voting rights usually come with shares of stock. The more shares you own, the more votes you have."

However, among the generated MCQs, the one that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is actually Question 7, but with the correct answer being: "In a traditional company, the person or people with the most shares decide" which is not among the options.

Considering the intent and the content of the ground truth MCQ, I would say that the closest match is actually not explicitly present in the generated MCQs, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is Question 7.

**Transcript**:
Pixar...the studio behind this,
and this, and this has mastered a sort of
photo-surrealistic style where there’s a sense of cartoony-ness but most things look and feel like they
could exist in the real world. Like these fibers on Mr. Incredible’s shirt. And this tree stump and grass from
this scene from Up. Or the glimmering, out-of-focus bokeh
behind Bo Peep. And it’s not just Pixar. These movies look so similar you can barely tell they’re from
different animation studios. But when you look at these movies it’s clear that something different
is happening. These lights don’t just illuminate;
they reveal a texture. This tree in the background 
isn’t out of focus it’s just got a simplified look. And this hair looks more like
brush strokes than human hair. These films are part of a new trend that’s steering animation away from 
replicating the real world and into somewhere new. Crafting beautiful animation in CG films requires a lot of dedicated artists
to perform specialized tasks: like rendering. Rendering is the process by which
a computer takes geometry, textures, lighting, camera inputs 
and does a bunch of math to apply all that information into
a final image. Like this one. Most render engines, like the one I’m using
here, are physically based which essentially means that it tries to replicate the real world physics
of light, shadow, reflection, and more. You can see this type of rendering
all over Pixar’s work even going back to their first movie. Rex looks like he could exist 
in the real world. Every meeting we would have, everybody
brought up like the Pixar look. The Pixar look was something that was very
high quality very successful at the box office so everybody kind of wanted the Pixar look. My name is Christos Obrenetov. Christos is the CEO of Lollipop Shaders a company that builds custom shaders
and plugins for 3D software. He’s worked on tons of films including "Life of Pi", "A Christmas Carol,"
and the upcoming "Across the Spider-Verse". But before all that he worked on a bunch of films that tried to
replicate that Pixar look. Because it was reliable, popular, and safe. Part of doing a feature film is, you know,
a lot of money and a lot of time. So they were kind of chasing that Pixar dream
of having that kind of a success. So to go and spend, you know, $100 million
or more... the investors and what not
are probably saying: "It's got to look like Pixar or Disney."
Right? And that was the case for a long time. Even when studios wanted to try
something different: Disney would come up and interview for a movie
that ended up being called "Bolt". They were showing us this really cool concept
art and they're like, "Oh, it's going to be super stylized." "It's going to look like sort of like 
the concept art." And it was very exciting. I was like, "Oh, this is great." And then when the movie 
did come out I mean, Bolt is fantastic, but they made it
very, you know, that same look. Movies like "Monster House" and "A Christmas
Carol" were intended to look stylized too but ultimately they settled back into
that tried-and-true physically based rendering look. There were glimmers of more stylized approaches
in short film tests and small sequences like in Disney’s Moana. But this stylized sequence
is only about 30 seconds out of the hour and 43 minute-long film. A lot of studios have been playing with
this for a long time. But to take that risk to do a full feature film that's
very stylized in 3D I think people were scared. And that fear kept studios from making
bold choices. Until 2017 when the trailer for
"Into the Spider-Verse" dropped. It had simplified graphic bursts that felt
like comic book panels. There was no motion blur or depth of field and everything, from the characters to the
environments, was full of texture. According to one of the animation supervisors
for the project after a year and a half of work the studio was still nervous that people were
going to hate the visuals. Because they felt like they were taking too
many risks. Instead of leaning into the safe, physically
based, rendering look "Into the Spider-Verse" chose to use 
non-photorealistic rendering. To pull this off, they essentially had to
break their physically-based renderer. Instead of inputting data from lights, 
camera, and materials and receiving a realistic looking render they combined all that data with custom
data passes that tweaked things like the focus plane or the way the light worked
in an image. This combo allowed the renderer 
to produce stylized results. For example, in "Into the Spider-verse",
out of focus elements aren’t blurry. Instead, the colors split as if the screen printing on an actual 
comic book was done poorly. Lighting and shadow were approached
in new ways too. Light often reveals halftone dots. And shadows create sketchy hatch marks. But there’s more than just shading magic
happening here. Non-photorealistic renderings often use linework 2D elements like speed lines and doubles and variable frame rates to pull these frames
further away from reality and often, closer to the concept art. Just two months after its release "Into the Spider-Verse" became the highest grossing
film Sony Pictures animation had ever made. It doesn’t hold a candle to Pixar
in terms of lifetime gross: "Incredibles 2" sits at the number one spot while Spider-verse doesn’t even crack
the top 50. But, much like Pixar did in the first wave
of CG animated features "Into the Spider-Verse" redefined
the visual goals for animation studios. 2021’s "The Mitchells vs the Machines" and
2022’s "Puss in Boots" take non-photorealistic rendering in a different,
more painterly direction where out-of-focus objects 
become simplified shapes emulating the way that artists may use 
simplified marks in backgrounds "In the Mitchells vs the Machines", shadows
create different marker textures. Puss in Boots’ simplified 2D cutaways mimic
the graphic bursts of Into the Spider-verse. People were like, "Oh, this is looks really
good and it's different". So now, all future projects at studios from
DreamWorks and Imageworks and Pixar— they're looking at the next whatever, five
years or whatnot. It's all like very stylized. And that’s really exciting because non-photorealism allows animated movies
to take advantage of the things that make them special. They can be anything the imagination allows.

**Transcript**:
Pixar...the studio behind this,
and this, and this has mastered a sort of
photo-surrealistic style where there’s a sense of cartoony-ness but most things look and feel like they
could exist in the real world. Like these fibers on Mr. Incredible’s shirt. And this tree stump and grass from
this scene from Up. Or the glimmering, out-of-focus bokeh
behind Bo Peep. And it’s not just Pixar. These movies look so similar you can barely tell they’re from
different animation studios. But when you look at these movies it’s clear that something different
is happening. These lights don’t just illuminate;
they reveal a texture. This tree in the background 
isn’t out of focus it’s just got a simplified look. And this hair looks more like
brush strokes than human hair. These films are part of a new trend that’s steering animation away from 
replicating the real world and into somewhere new. Crafting beautiful animation in CG films requires a lot of dedicated artists
to perform specialized tasks: like rendering. Rendering is the process by which
a computer takes geometry, textures, lighting, camera inputs 
and does a bunch of math to apply all that information into
a final image. Like this one. Most render engines, like the one I’m using
here, are physically based which essentially means that it tries to replicate the real world physics
of light, shadow, reflection, and more. You can see this type of rendering
all over Pixar’s work even going back to their first movie. Rex looks like he could exist 
in the real world. Every meeting we would have, everybody
brought up like the Pixar look. The Pixar look was something that was very
high quality very successful at the box office so everybody kind of wanted the Pixar look. My name is Christos Obrenetov. Christos is the CEO of Lollipop Shaders a company that builds custom shaders
and plugins for 3D software. He’s worked on tons of films including "Life of Pi", "A Christmas Carol,"
and the upcoming "Across the Spider-Verse". But before all that he worked on a bunch of films that tried to
replicate that Pixar look. Because it was reliable, popular, and safe. Part of doing a feature film is, you know,
a lot of money and a lot of time. So they were kind of chasing that Pixar dream
of having that kind of a success. So to go and spend, you know, $100 million
or more... the investors and what not
are probably saying: "It's got to look like Pixar or Disney."
Right? And that was the case for a long time. Even when studios wanted to try
something different: Disney would come up and interview for a movie
that ended up being called "Bolt". They were showing us this really cool concept
art and they're like, "Oh, it's going to be super stylized." "It's going to look like sort of like 
the concept art." And it was very exciting. I was like, "Oh, this is great." And then when the movie 
did come out I mean, Bolt is fantastic, but they made it
very, you know, that same look. Movies like "Monster House" and "A Christmas
Carol" were intended to look stylized too but ultimately they settled back into
that tried-and-true physically based rendering look. There were glimmers of more stylized approaches
in short film tests and small sequences like in Disney’s Moana. But this stylized sequence
is only about 30 seconds out of the hour and 43 minute-long film. A lot of studios have been playing with
this for a long time. But to take that risk to do a full feature film that's
very stylized in 3D I think people were scared. And that fear kept studios from making
bold choices. Until 2017 when the trailer for
"Into the Spider-Verse" dropped. It had simplified graphic bursts that felt
like comic book panels. There was no motion blur or depth of field and everything, from the characters to the
environments, was full of texture. According to one of the animation supervisors
for the project after a year and a half of work the studio was still nervous that people were
going to hate the visuals. Because they felt like they were taking too
many risks. Instead of leaning into the safe, physically
based, rendering look "Into the Spider-Verse" chose to use 
non-photorealistic rendering. To pull this off, they essentially had to
break their physically-based renderer. Instead of inputting data from lights, 
camera, and materials and receiving a realistic looking render they combined all that data with custom
data passes that tweaked things like the focus plane or the way the light worked
in an image. This combo allowed the renderer 
to produce stylized results. For example, in "Into the Spider-verse",
out of focus elements aren’t blurry. Instead, the colors split as if the screen printing on an actual 
comic book was done poorly. Lighting and shadow were approached
in new ways too. Light often reveals halftone dots. And shadows create sketchy hatch marks. But there’s more than just shading magic
happening here. Non-photorealistic renderings often use linework 2D elements like speed lines and doubles and variable frame rates to pull these frames
further away from reality and often, closer to the concept art. Just two months after its release "Into the Spider-Verse" became the highest grossing
film Sony Pictures animation had ever made. It doesn’t hold a candle to Pixar
in terms of lifetime gross: "Incredibles 2" sits at the number one spot while Spider-verse doesn’t even crack
the top 50. But, much like Pixar did in the first wave
of CG animated features "Into the Spider-Verse" redefined
the visual goals for animation studios. 2021’s "The Mitchells vs the Machines" and
2022’s "Puss in Boots" take non-photorealistic rendering in a different,
more painterly direction where out-of-focus objects 
become simplified shapes emulating the way that artists may use 
simplified marks in backgrounds "In the Mitchells vs the Machines", shadows
create different marker textures. Puss in Boots’ simplified 2D cutaways mimic
the graphic bursts of Into the Spider-verse. People were like, "Oh, this is looks really
good and it's different". So now, all future projects at studios from
DreamWorks and Imageworks and Pixar— they're looking at the next whatever, five
years or whatnot. It's all like very stylized. And that’s really exciting because non-photorealism allows animated movies
to take advantage of the things that make them special. They can be anything the imagination allows.

**Transcript**:
On a daily basis, you spend
between a third and half your waking hours daydreaming. That may sound like a huge waste of time, but scientists think it must have 
some purpose, or humans wouldn’t have evolved
to do so much of it. So to figure out what's going on here, let’s take a closer look 
at the mind-wanderer in chief: the bored teenager. Wouldn’t it be cool to discover something,
anything. Like even this plant. Just to be one of those explorers who 
sails around drawing stuff for years on end 
and everyone thinks they’re a genius. But does anyone even do that anymore? Is there anything left to discover? And would I be tough enough to deal 
with the dysentery or scurvy or piranhas or whatever? I barely have the endurance
to make it through track practice... but I will. Any day now, I’ll have the
discipline to show up before sunrise and practice. I’ll win all my races. Winning will become so easy,
I’ll pick up other events just for fun. And once I'm in the Olympics, they’ll have no choice 
but to crown me team captain, which I will graciously accept. And will I be nasty to the teammate
who yelled at me? No. I’ll just calmly say, 
“hope you’re in a better mood.” Okay. Yours and other people's daydreams
might sound or feel something like that. Let's see what was going on. To see what parts of the brain are active when you’re doing a task, or thinking,
or daydreaming, scientists use brain imaging techniques 
that show increased blood flow and energy 
expenditure in those areas. These brain areas are active, working together and communicating
with each other. Taken together, they're called
the executive network. When your mind starts to wander, a different set of brain areas
becomes active. These areas make up the
default mode network. The name default mode makes it sound
like nothing is going on. And in fact, for many years, scientists associated this pattern
of activity with rest. But a closer look reveals that these
are the brain areas involved when we revisit a memory, when we think
about our plans and hopes, and yes, when our minds are wandering
off on a wild daydream. The mind can wander to unproductive
or distressing places and brood over negative past events,
like an argument. It can also wander to neutral,
everyday matters, like planning out the rest
of one's afternoon. But where mind-wandering 
really gets interesting is when it crosses into the realm 
of free-moving associative thought that you aren’t consciously directing. This kind of mind-wandering is associated 
with increases in both ideas and positive emotions, and the evidence suggests that daydreaming
can help people envision ways to reach their goals and navigate
relationships and social situations. Scientists think there may be 
two essential parts to this process: a generative phase of free-flowing ideas
and spontaneous thoughts, courtesy of the default mode network, followed by a process of selecting, 
developing, and pursuing the best ideas from that generative burst, driven by logical thinking 
thanks to the executive network. A host of imaging studies suggest that
these two networks working in sync is a crucial condition 
for creative thinking. Taken together, the evidence clearly
suggests the logical realm of the executive network and the imaginative realm 
of the default mode network are closely related. And as you can see, the executive network
is still playing a role when the default mode network is
doing its thing during daydreaming. In teenagers, the prefrontal cortex and other areas
involved in executive function are still developing, but teens are perfectly capable of 
thinking through their problems and goals, especially when given space to do so
on their own.

**Transcript**:
On a daily basis, you spend
between a third and half your waking hours daydreaming. That may sound like a huge waste of time, but scientists think it must have 
some purpose, or humans wouldn’t have evolved
to do so much of it. So to figure out what's going on here, let’s take a closer look 
at the mind-wanderer in chief: the bored teenager. Wouldn’t it be cool to discover something,
anything. Like even this plant. Just to be one of those explorers who 
sails around drawing stuff for years on end 
and everyone thinks they’re a genius. But does anyone even do that anymore? Is there anything left to discover? And would I be tough enough to deal 
with the dysentery or scurvy or piranhas or whatever? I barely have the endurance
to make it through track practice... but I will. Any day now, I’ll have the
discipline to show up before sunrise and practice. I’ll win all my races. Winning will become so easy,
I’ll pick up other events just for fun. And once I'm in the Olympics, they’ll have no choice 
but to crown me team captain, which I will graciously accept. And will I be nasty to the teammate
who yelled at me? No. I’ll just calmly say, 
“hope you’re in a better mood.” Okay. Yours and other people's daydreams
might sound or feel something like that. Let's see what was going on. To see what parts of the brain are active when you’re doing a task, or thinking,
or daydreaming, scientists use brain imaging techniques 
that show increased blood flow and energy 
expenditure in those areas. These brain areas are active, working together and communicating
with each other. Taken together, they're called
the executive network. When your mind starts to wander, a different set of brain areas
becomes active. These areas make up the
default mode network. The name default mode makes it sound
like nothing is going on. And in fact, for many years, scientists associated this pattern
of activity with rest. But a closer look reveals that these
are the brain areas involved when we revisit a memory, when we think
about our plans and hopes, and yes, when our minds are wandering
off on a wild daydream. The mind can wander to unproductive
or distressing places and brood over negative past events,
like an argument. It can also wander to neutral,
everyday matters, like planning out the rest
of one's afternoon. But where mind-wandering 
really gets interesting is when it crosses into the realm 
of free-moving associative thought that you aren’t consciously directing. This kind of mind-wandering is associated 
with increases in both ideas and positive emotions, and the evidence suggests that daydreaming
can help people envision ways to reach their goals and navigate
relationships and social situations. Scientists think there may be 
two essential parts to this process: a generative phase of free-flowing ideas
and spontaneous thoughts, courtesy of the default mode network, followed by a process of selecting, 
developing, and pursuing the best ideas from that generative burst, driven by logical thinking 
thanks to the executive network. A host of imaging studies suggest that
these two networks working in sync is a crucial condition 
for creative thinking. Taken together, the evidence clearly
suggests the logical realm of the executive network and the imaginative realm 
of the default mode network are closely related. And as you can see, the executive network
is still playing a role when the default mode network is
doing its thing during daydreaming. In teenagers, the prefrontal cortex and other areas
involved in executive function are still developing, but teens are perfectly capable of 
thinking through their problems and goals, especially when given space to do so
on their own.

**Transcript**:
When I was six, my father told me that I was made
out of tiny cells filled with chromosomes that would control my fate. I thought, "That's amazing. There are so many mysterious things
in there, and I want to know more.” I read about Galileo and Darwin,
and I became a scientist. At that time, hardly anything was known. We did not yet know that the chemical
elements came from exploded stars, that everything you see around you
was recycled from inside of stars. So we did not know we are recycled stars. But we set off to measure the Big Bang, and we measured the map of the cosmic
microwave background radiation, using millimeter waves and it's the entire sky
wrapped around on to an oval so you can see it. We see that there are hot and cold
spots in this Big Bang material. Now we say, well, that’s because those
were there in very, very beginning, who knows exactly why, but they led to the existence of galaxies,
stars, planets and, eventually, people. No spots, no people. So it turned out to be important. So then how did that work? What happened next? Well, we said let's take pictures. So, of course, we take pictures of the
sky with the Hubble Space Telescope. This picture was taken around 1995, and it shows galaxies far, far, far away. It shows what you can get with the telescope
that's about eight feet in diameter and can observe visible light. So we were thrilled to have this picture. And it shows thousands of galaxies. They were unable to include
the most distant galaxies, the ones that would be
as they were being born, so there are no baby pictures
of galaxies in this picture. We needed to have an even bigger
and more powerful telescope that could pick up the infrared light
from the most distant universe that has been stretched out
by the expansion of the universe. So we didn't know what we would find. So astronomers wrote a book and they said, "Please build us an even more
powerful telescope." And we did. This is the James Webb Space Telescope,
you see a gigantic mirror, it's hexagonal, it's coated with gold
so it reflects infrared light. It is 21 feet across. It is protected by a five-layer
metalized plastic sunshade as large as a tennis court. This telescope is so large
that it could not fit into the rocket without being folded up like origami. It's an incredible engineering
accomplishment to be able to even conceive
and build this telescope. So we built it. And then we've launched it. It went up into space from French Guiana
on Christmas morning, 2021. It was a perfect launch. The Arianespace company sent it
straight to where we needed to go. So we think we can have 20 years
of operational scientific observations with this great new telescope. And it took only two minutes
to go through the tropical clouds up towards the vacuum of outer space. Now I want to show you
how it unfolded in outer space, this origami telescope. First we unfolded the solar panels. Then we unfold the transmitter antenna so we can talk back and forth. Then we unfold the panels
that hold the great sunshade in place. This takes us actually
two weeks in real life. You see it compressed here
so we can show it to you. This is just a miracle of modern
engineering, and it’s so complicated. And you'd say, is there any way
you could have done this without this great telescope? And the answer seems to be no. You need a big telescope. It needs to be in outer space. It needs to be cold, so it doesn’t glow
and emit its own infrared. And third is, being very carefully
unrolled all by commands from here. So you ask, how could you possibly
make such a complicated thing work? Well, number one, practice,
practice, practice, rehearse and test,
fix it when it's not quite right. And then, of course, have two
of everything, if you possibly can. And third, have arguments
with all of your friends to say, is this really right? Can you think of anything that's a mistake
that we might be making that we should fix before we launch it? So the last step is finally
to unfold the telescope itself. And there it is in outer space, not quite ready to use because it's still
warm and has not yet been focused. So we had to wait for several weeks
for it to start to cool down to a low enough temperature
that we could do the next steps. We send it to a place
called Lagrange Point 2, about a million miles farther out
from the Sun than we are. This is a place that moves around
the Sun with us every year, so the telescope does not
get any farther away. It is the only place that we can put
a telescope where this is the setup, and you can have the one-sided umbrella
that protects the telescope from the Sun and the Earth and the Moon. So the next thing is, what did we see? We focused the telescope
and took some pictures of the same star
we looked at with the Webb. So the fuzzy picture is the Spitzer
Space Telescope launched in 2003. The sharp picture
is the new Webb telescope. We were so thrilled that it worked. We got a nice, sharp image of the star, and we can calculate now
the sensitivity of this object, that if you were a bumblebee, a square centimeter object
hovering at the distance of the Moon from the Earth,
away from the telescope, we would be able to see you, both the sunlight you reflect
and the heat you emit. So there are no bumblebees in space, but there's something out there
that we don't know. And I'm so sure that we're going to get
a great surprise from this telescope. So I'll show you what we look at. Here is an example of a place
where stars are being born as we speak. Now we know, more or less,
that stars explode and produce dust, which goes and is recycled into new stars. This is a place where
the recycling is happening. Stars are being born in this beautiful
cloud of glowing gas and dust. On the left-hand side shows you
what we see with visible light with the Hubble Space Telescope. The right-hand side shows you
that you can begin to see through the dust with an infrared camera that we also have
on the Hubble telescope. It's beautiful. Astronomers want to see inside and we will with the Webb telescope. We can look at everything
in the solar system from Mars on out. So this is a pretty interesting one, everybody knows Mars might be alive. What about Europa? Europa is a satellite of Jupiter. It has a liquid ocean covered with ice. We know because we sent a probe
out there named after Galileo himself, and we saw this and took this picture. Now we know that there is water
coming out from the cracks between the ice blocks and once in a while,
they can be watched from here. And we are planning to send a probe
to fly through the water jets and see if there might be
any organic molecules in them. Is it alive? Well, maybe. We'll be watching this satellite
with the Webb telescope as well. Farther on out in the solar system,
we've been watching Titan. Titan is the only moon in the solar system
that has oceans and lakes and rain and rivers
and an atmosphere on the surface. It is so cold, though, that its liquid hydrocarbons,
methane and ethane, that you would use for fuel here on Earth. So we'll be examining this
with the Webb telescope and we'll be sending a probe out there to land with even a helicopter
to go exploring. So is this a place
that's interesting for life? Possibly. People ask me all the time, are we sure that the kind
we have here is the only kind? Well, maybe not. And if not, this is a good place
to look because it's different, but it still has solids,
liquids and gases, and it has a liquid hydrocarbon,
which might be a possible solvent. We'll see. Next thing we want to look at is, are there planets around other stars
that might have life? So we will be looking in this way at small stars that have
Earth-sized planets. When a planet goes in front of the star,
it can block some starlight, some of the starlight goes through
the atmosphere of the planet, if it has one, and on its way to our telescope, and we can analyze that and look for the chemistry
of such an atmosphere. So, number one, does a little
Earth-like planet out there have an atmosphere? Number two, does it have any
molecules in the atmosphere? And number three, could they be water? Is there enough water out there
so that there could be a liquid ocean? Well, maybe. We will find out and we'll tell you. So are we alone? Well, I don't know. But we'll be going on after this project to even more powerful telescopes that can examine little Earths
around stars like the Sun. And then we'll be able to say,
"Really, really, are they like home?" And maybe yes. We will be telling you
all about what we find out, beginning with our first scientific
observations this summer. So please stay tuned. Astronomers travel with the speed of light and the speed of imagination. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
When I was six, my father told me that I was made
out of tiny cells filled with chromosomes that would control my fate. I thought, "That's amazing. There are so many mysterious things
in there, and I want to know more.” I read about Galileo and Darwin,
and I became a scientist. At that time, hardly anything was known. We did not yet know that the chemical
elements came from exploded stars, that everything you see around you
was recycled from inside of stars. So we did not know we are recycled stars. But we set off to measure the Big Bang, and we measured the map of the cosmic
microwave background radiation, using millimeter waves and it's the entire sky
wrapped around on to an oval so you can see it. We see that there are hot and cold
spots in this Big Bang material. Now we say, well, that’s because those
were there in very, very beginning, who knows exactly why, but they led to the existence of galaxies,
stars, planets and, eventually, people. No spots, no people. So it turned out to be important. So then how did that work? What happened next? Well, we said let's take pictures. So, of course, we take pictures of the
sky with the Hubble Space Telescope. This picture was taken around 1995, and it shows galaxies far, far, far away. It shows what you can get with the telescope
that's about eight feet in diameter and can observe visible light. So we were thrilled to have this picture. And it shows thousands of galaxies. They were unable to include
the most distant galaxies, the ones that would be
as they were being born, so there are no baby pictures
of galaxies in this picture. We needed to have an even bigger
and more powerful telescope that could pick up the infrared light
from the most distant universe that has been stretched out
by the expansion of the universe. So we didn't know what we would find. So astronomers wrote a book and they said, "Please build us an even more
powerful telescope." And we did. This is the James Webb Space Telescope,
you see a gigantic mirror, it's hexagonal, it's coated with gold
so it reflects infrared light. It is 21 feet across. It is protected by a five-layer
metalized plastic sunshade as large as a tennis court. This telescope is so large
that it could not fit into the rocket without being folded up like origami. It's an incredible engineering
accomplishment to be able to even conceive
and build this telescope. So we built it. And then we've launched it. It went up into space from French Guiana
on Christmas morning, 2021. It was a perfect launch. The Arianespace company sent it

**Transcript**:
Tens of thousands of conehead termites
are swarming in the Panamanian air. These 4 young hopefuls are brave— oh... I guess 3. 
Oh, wow, 2 in 1. Okay! This single determined termite 
is braving countless threats to participate in the only flight 
of her lifetime. She evades the onslaught of predators 
even as she lands, flips off her wings, secretes pheromones, and attracts a mate. The pair dash from the danger zone
into a rotting tree stump. It’s the perfect first home—
but they’re not alone. Unlike most termite species, conehead termite colonies can have
multiple queens and kings. The pair is joined by several other
termites ready to reproduce. Together, they excavate
a chamber in the stump, seal the entrance and get busy. When the resulting offspring hatch, they 
bear little resemblance to their parents; they’re smaller, wingless,
eyeless, and sterile. Some of them, the soldiers, have the species’ trademark 
conspicuously shaped heads— the function of which will
soon be revealed. They set out to scout for dead wood,
laying the pheromone trails the rest of the offspring, 
the colony’s workers, follow and reinforce 
as they retrieve food. As the termites collect and decompose 
plant debris, they return essential nutrients
to the soil, allowing more vegetation to thrive. Gradually, worker termites expand
the colony's central chamber as they groom and feed the royals
and the upcoming broods. The tiniest termites can’t yet
eat wood independently. So, the workers process it and gift it 
to the youngsters through their saliva and by basically throwing
up into their mouths. With the workers managing groceries,
construction, and child care, the royals fully commit themselves
to reproduction. The kings provide sperm
on an as-needed basis, and the queens undergo radical
transformations. Their abdomens develop efficient 
egg-laying machinery and extend dramatically. Each queen may produce hundreds
of eggs a day. Meanwhile, a worker entourage retrieves
and neatly stacks them into piles. The colony grows quickly. And once its population is big enough, workers construct a system of tunnels
stretching over 100 meters across terrain, along fallen logs,
and up into tree crowns. These tunnels shelter the termites
as they travel to and from food sites around the clock. And eventually, they build 
a distinctive central nest. Using partially digested 
plant material, soil, and poop, they construct a massive 
egg-shaped structure, complete with numerous passages,
chambers, and ventilation holes. Deep within, they establish a royal cell
that's fortified with extra thick walls. It’s not long before this architectural
marvel attracts an admirer: an anteater. She swipes at the nest 
and pokes her long tongue in. Those trapped in the tongue’s spines 
and sticky saliva are whisked off to their deaths. But the termite soldiers
launch a counterattack. They’re tiny and blind but their heads
function like squirt guns. They secure the anteater’s position
using chemical signals, clench their powerful muscles and shoot
a sticky spray from their heads. After a minute, 
the anteater stops feeding, scratches the goo away, 
and lopes off. The nest sustained some damage, 
but the royals remain undisturbed, pumping out eggs into their
reinforced fortress. As the colony matures, some of the
young develop into reproductives. Most fly off to establish new colonies—
one lands on a fallen tree, another scrambles into a crack 
in a house, and another climbs into a shipping crate. But some will simply saunter 
to sites nearby and become the monarchs 
of the colony’s satellite nests. With one of the longest insect lifespans, a termite queen’s reign can
last more than 20 years. The original queens and kings eventually
die, but by the time they go, several satellite nests
are already thriving. Their reproductive offspring
inherit the throne, meaning that their colony may
persist for decades to come.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the caste of termites, and the correct answer is "Princess/Prince" as it is not a recognized caste in the provided transcript. 

Although there isn't a direct match, Question 3: "What is the role of worker termites in the colony?" is the closest in terms of discussing termite castes and roles. However, it does not explicitly ask about the non-existent "Princess/Prince" caste.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 3 (Index 3) is the closest match, but it's essential to note that it's not a direct match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be needed to perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ.

To create a more accurate match, a generated MCQ like this could be created:
Question: Which of the following is not a recognized caste in a termite colony?
Options: A. Worker, B. Queen/King, C. Princess/Prince, D. Soldier
Correct Option: C

This revised generated MCQ would more closely align with the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Tens of thousands of conehead termites
are swarming in the Panamanian air. These 4 young hopefuls are brave— oh... I guess 3. 
Oh, wow, 2 in 1. Okay! This single determined termite 
is braving countless threats to participate in the only flight 
of her lifetime. She evades the onslaught of predators 
even as she lands, flips off her wings, secretes pheromones, and attracts a mate. The pair dash from the danger zone
into a rotting tree stump. It’s the perfect first home—
but they’re not alone. Unlike most termite species, conehead termite colonies can have
multiple queens and kings. The pair is joined by several other
termites ready to reproduce. Together, they excavate
a chamber in the stump, seal the entrance and get busy. When the resulting offspring hatch, they 
bear little resemblance to their parents; they’re smaller, wingless,
eyeless, and sterile. Some of them, the soldiers, have the species’ trademark 
conspicuously shaped heads— the function of which will
soon be revealed. They set out to scout for dead wood,
laying the pheromone trails the rest of the offspring, 
the colony’s workers, follow and reinforce 
as they retrieve food. As the termites collect and decompose 
plant debris, they return essential nutrients
to the soil, allowing more vegetation to thrive. Gradually, worker termites expand
the colony's central chamber as they groom and feed the royals
and the upcoming broods. The tiniest termites can’t yet
eat wood independently. So, the workers process it and gift it 
to the youngsters through their saliva and by basically throwing
up into their mouths. With the workers managing groceries,
construction, and child care, the royals fully commit themselves
to reproduction. The kings provide sperm
on an as-needed basis, and the queens undergo radical
transformations. Their abdomens develop efficient 
egg-laying machinery and extend dramatically. Each queen may produce hundreds
of eggs a day. Meanwhile, a worker entourage retrieves
and neatly stacks them into piles. The colony grows quickly. And once its population is big enough, workers construct a system of tunnels
stretching over 100 meters across terrain, along fallen logs,
and up into tree crowns. These tunnels shelter the termites
as they travel to and from food sites around the clock. And eventually, they build 
a distinctive central nest. Using partially digested 
plant material, soil, and poop, they construct a massive 
egg-shaped structure, complete with numerous passages,
chambers, and ventilation holes. Deep within, they establish a royal cell
that's fortified with extra thick walls. It’s not long before this architectural
marvel attracts an admirer: an anteater. She swipes at the nest 
and pokes her long tongue in. Those trapped in the tongue’s spines 
and sticky saliva are whisked off to their deaths. But the termite soldiers
launch a counterattack. They’re tiny and blind but their heads
function like squirt guns. They secure the anteater’s position
using chemical signals, clench their powerful muscles and shoot
a sticky spray from their heads. After a minute, 
the anteater stops feeding, scratches the goo away, 
and lopes off. The nest sustained some damage, 
but the royals remain undisturbed, pumping out eggs into their
reinforced fortress. As the colony matures, some of the
young develop into reproductives. Most fly off to establish new colonies—
one lands on a fallen tree, another scrambles into a crack 
in a house, and another climbs into a shipping crate. But some will simply saunter 
to sites nearby and become the monarchs 
of the colony’s satellite nests. With one of the longest insect lifespans, a termite queen’s reign can
last more than 20 years. The original queens and kings eventually
die, but by the time they go, several satellite nests
are already thriving. Their reproductive offspring
inherit the throne, meaning that their colony may
persist for decades to come.

**Transcript**:
Tens of thousands of conehead termites
are swarming in the Panamanian air. These 4 young hopefuls are brave— oh... I guess 3. 
Oh, wow, 2 in 1. Okay! This single determined termite 
is braving countless threats to participate in the only flight 
of her lifetime. She evades the onslaught of predators 
even as she lands, flips off her wings, secretes pheromones, and attracts a mate. The pair dash from the danger zone
into a rotting tree stump. It’s the perfect first home—
but they’re not alone. Unlike most termite species, conehead termite colonies can have
multiple queens and kings. The pair is joined by several other
termites ready to reproduce. Together, they excavate
a chamber in the stump, seal the entrance and get busy. When the resulting offspring hatch, they 
bear little resemblance to their parents; they’re smaller, wingless,
eyeless, and sterile. Some of them, the soldiers, have the species’ trademark 
conspicuously shaped heads— the function of which will
soon be revealed. They set out to scout for dead wood,
laying the pheromone trails the rest of the offspring, 
the colony’s workers, follow and reinforce 
as they retrieve food. As the termites collect and decompose 
plant debris, they return essential nutrients
to the soil, allowing more vegetation to thrive. Gradually, worker termites expand
the colony's central chamber as they groom and feed the royals
and the upcoming broods. The tiniest termites can’t yet
eat wood independently. So, the workers process it and gift it 
to the youngsters through their saliva and by basically throwing
up into their mouths. With the workers managing groceries,
construction, and child care, the royals fully commit themselves
to reproduction. The kings provide sperm
on an as-needed basis, and the queens undergo radical
transformations. Their abdomens develop efficient 
egg-laying machinery and extend dramatically. Each queen may produce hundreds
of eggs a day. Meanwhile, a worker entourage retrieves
and neatly stacks them into piles. The colony grows quickly. And once its population is big enough, workers construct a system of tunnels
stretching over 100 meters across terrain, along fallen logs,
and up into tree crowns. These tunnels shelter the termites
as they travel to and from food sites around the clock. And eventually, they build 
a distinctive central nest. Using partially digested 
plant material, soil, and poop, they construct a massive 
egg-shaped structure, complete with numerous passages,
chambers, and ventilation holes. Deep within, they establish a royal cell
that's fortified with extra thick walls. It’s not long before this architectural
marvel attracts an admirer: an anteater. She swipes at the nest 
and pokes her long tongue in. Those trapped in the tongue’s spines 
and sticky saliva are whisked off to their deaths. But the termite soldiers
launch a counterattack. They’re tiny and blind but their heads
function like squirt guns. They secure the anteater’s position
using chemical signals, clench their powerful muscles and shoot
a sticky spray from their heads. After a minute, 
the anteater stops feeding, scratches the goo away, 
and lopes off. The nest sustained some damage, 
but the royals remain undisturbed, pumping out eggs into their
reinforced fortress. As the colony matures, some of the
young develop into reproductives. Most fly off to establish new colonies—
one lands on a fallen tree, another scrambles into a crack 
in a house, and another climbs into a shipping crate. But some will simply saunter 
to sites nearby and become the monarchs 
of the colony’s satellite nests. With one of the longest insect lifespans, a termite queen’s reign can
last more than 20 years. The original queens and kings eventually
die, but by the time they go, several satellite nests
are already thriving. Their reproductive offspring
inherit the throne, meaning that their colony may
persist for decades to come.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly stated in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the ecological role of conehead termites in their natural environment. The correct option mentions that they eat dead plants and recycle essential nutrients to the soil, allowing vegetation to thrive.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 3: "What is the role of worker termites in the colony?" has an option C: "To manage groceries, construction, and child care." This option indirectly relates to the ecological role of conehead termites, as it mentions managing groceries, which involves collecting and decomposing plant debris.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the ecological role of conehead termites. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the provided generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would suggest Question 3, but with the understanding that it only partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that this is not an exact match, and a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the ecological role of conehead termites.

**Transcript**:
How do you know you’re a person 
who has lived your life, rather than a just-formed brain
full of artificial memories, momentarily hallucinating a reality
that doesn't actually exist? That may sound absurd, but it’s kept several generations 
of top cosmologists up at night. They call it the Boltzmann brain paradox. Its namesake, Ludwig Boltzmann,
was a 19th century physicist operating in a period when scientists 
were passionately debating whether the universe had existed 
for an infinite or finite time. Boltzmann’s main claim to fame was
revolutionizing thermodynamics, the branch of physics that studies energy. He put forward a new interpretation
of entropy, which is a measure 
of the disorder of a system. A glass is an ordered system, 
whereas a shattered glass is disordered. The second law of thermodynamics states
that closed systems tend towards disorder: you won’t see a shattered glass
return to its pristine state. Boltzmann’s insight was applying 
statistical reasoning to this behavior. He found that a system evolves to a more
disordered state because it’s more likely. However, the opposite direction
isn’t impossible, just so unlikely that we’ll never witness
things like scrambled eggs turning raw. But if the universe exists
over an infinitely long time, extremely unlikely events will happen, including complex things forming 
out of random combinations of particles. So what does that look like in a
hypothetical infinitely old universe? In this unremarkable stretch
of near-nothingness, about eight octillion atoms randomly
come together to form a replica of the Thinker made of pasta. It instantly dissolves. Over here, these particles suddenly form
something like a brain. It’s filled with false memories
of a lifetime up to the present moment, when it perceives a video saying 
these very words, before decaying. And finally, by random fluctuations,
all the particles in the cosmos concentrate in a single point, and an entire new universe spontaneously
bursts into existence. Of those last two, 
which is more likely? The brain, by far— despite all its complexity, it’s a blip
compared to an entire universe. Every one universe produced by random
fluctuations has equivalent odds to heaps upon heaps of insta-brains. So by this reasoning, 
it seems extremely more likely that everything you believe to exist 
is actually a brief illusion, soon to be extinguished. Boltzmann didn’t get quite
that far in his thinking; the brains themselves were introduced by
later cosmologists building on his work. But they, like just about everyone else, were pretty sure that they themselves
weren't just ephemeral brains. So the paradox was: how could they be
correct and the universe be eternal? The resolution is something most take 
for granted today: that our universe
has not existed forever, but rather time and space
started with a Big Bang. So that’s the paradox over and done with,
right? Well, maybe not. In the last century, scientists have found
evidence supporting the theory of the Big Bang everywhere we look. Yet while we know 
that the Big Bang happened, no one knows what, if anything, 
preceded and caused it. Why did the universe begin in such
an extremely ordered, and unlikely, state? Is our universe in an unending cycle
of creation and collapse? Or might we be in one of many universes
expanding within a multiverse? In this context, Boltzmann’s paradox 
has found renewed interest by contemporary cosmologists. Some argue that leading models 
for where the universe came from still imply that Boltzmann brains 
are more likely than human brains, suggesting something’s amiss. Others counter that slight modifications
of the cosmological models would avoid the problem, or that Boltzmann’s brains
can’t actually physically form. Some researchers even attempted 
to calculate the probability of a brain popping out of 
random quantum fluctuations long enough to think a single thought. They got this incredible number whose denominator is 10 to a number 
about a septillion times larger than the number of stars in the universe. The Boltzmann brain paradox,
despite its absurdity, is useful because it creates a bar
that models have to rise to. If, compared to numbers like this one, the current state of the universe
is exceedingly unlikely, something in the model is
almost certainly wrong. Unless you’re the one who is wrong...

preceded and caused it. Why did the universe begin in such
an extremely ordered, and unlikely, state? Is our universe in an unending cycle
of creation and collapse? Or might we be in one of many universes
expanding within a multiverse? In this context, Boltzmann’s paradox 
has found renewed interest by contemporary cosmologists. Some argue that leading models 
for where the universe came from still imply that Boltzmann brains 
are more likely than human brains, suggesting something’s amiss. Others counter that slight modifications
of the cosmological models would avoid the problem, or that Boltzmann’s brains
can’t actually physically form. Some researchers even attempted 
to calculate the probability of a brain popping out of 
random quantum fluctuations long enough to think a single thought. They got this incredible number whose denominator is 10 to a number 
about a septillion times larger than the number of stars in the universe. The Boltzmann brain paradox,
despite its absurdity, is useful because it creates a bar
that models have to rise to. If, compared to numbers like this one, the current state of the universe
is exceedingly unlikely, something in the model is
almost certainly wrong. Unless you’re the one who is wrong...

**Transcript**:
How do you know you’re a person 
who has lived your life, rather than a just-formed brain
full of artificial memories, momentarily hallucinating a reality
that doesn't actually exist? That may sound absurd, but it’s kept several generations 
of top cosmologists up at night. They call it the Boltzmann brain paradox. Its namesake, Ludwig Boltzmann,
was a 19th century physicist operating in a period when scientists 
were passionately debating whether the universe had existed 
for an infinite or finite time. Boltzmann’s main claim to fame was
revolutionizing thermodynamics, the branch of physics that studies energy. He put forward a new interpretation
of entropy, which is a measure 
of the disorder of a system. A glass is an ordered system, 
whereas a shattered glass is disordered. The second law of thermodynamics states
that closed systems tend towards disorder: you won’t see a shattered glass
return to its pristine state. Boltzmann’s insight was applying 
statistical reasoning to this behavior. He found that a system evolves to a more
disordered state because it’s more likely. However, the opposite direction
isn’t impossible, just so unlikely that we’ll never witness
things like scrambled eggs turning raw. But if the universe exists
over an infinitely long time, extremely unlikely events will happen, including complex things forming 
out of random combinations of particles. So what does that look like in a
hypothetical infinitely old universe? In this unremarkable stretch
of near-nothingness, about eight octillion atoms randomly
come together to form a replica of the Thinker made of pasta. It instantly dissolves. Over here, these particles suddenly form
something like a brain. It’s filled with false memories
of a lifetime up to the present moment, when it perceives a video saying 
these very words, before decaying. And finally, by random fluctuations,
all the particles in the cosmos concentrate in a single point, and an entire new universe spontaneously
bursts into existence. Of those last two, 
which is more likely? The brain, by far— despite all its complexity, it’s a blip
compared to an entire universe. Every one universe produced by random
fluctuations has equivalent odds to heaps upon heaps of insta-brains. So by this reasoning, 
it seems extremely more likely that everything you believe to exist 
is actually a brief illusion, soon to be extinguished. Boltzmann didn’t get quite
that far in his thinking; the brains themselves were introduced by
later cosmologists building on his work. But they, like just about everyone else, were pretty sure that they themselves
weren't just ephemeral brains. So the paradox was: how could they be
correct and the universe be eternal? The resolution is something most take 
for granted today: that our universe
has not existed forever, but rather time and space
started with a Big Bang. So that’s the paradox over and done with,
right? Well, maybe not. In the last century, scientists have found
evidence supporting the theory of the Big Bang everywhere we look. Yet while we know 
that the Big Bang happened, no one knows what, if anything, 
preceded and caused it. Why did the universe begin in such
an extremely ordered, and unlikely, state? Is our universe in an unending cycle
of creation and collapse? Or might we be in one of many universes
expanding within a multiverse? In this context, Boltzmann’s paradox 
has found renewed interest by contemporary cosmologists. Some argue that leading models 
for where the universe came from still imply that Boltzmann brains 
are more likely than human brains, suggesting something’s amiss. Others counter that slight modifications
of the cosmological models would avoid the problem, or that Boltzmann’s brains
can’t actually physically form. Some researchers even attempted

is exceedingly unlikely, something in the model is
almost certainly wrong. Unless you’re the one who is wrong...

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4: According to the Boltzmann brain paradox, what is more likely to form in an infinitely old universe: a brain with false memories or an entire new universe?**

Although this question does not directly ask about the fundamental prerequisite for the formation of Boltzmann brains, it implies the concept of an infinitely old universe, which is the correct prerequisite. The correct option in the ground truth MCQ is "If the Universe were to be infinite in the temporal dimension," which is closely related to the concept of an infinitely old universe.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. But among the available options, Question 4 is the most similar.

What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

**Transcript**:
What does it mean for a country
to have a healthy economy? What does a healthy economy 
even look like? Does it look like this? What about like this? Economist Kate Raworth shared a
pretty interesting answer to this question on the TED Interview podcast. And it challenges an idea that most
economists take for granted. We live— particularly in the West, 
particularly in the last 150 years— in a society that has a very strong belief
that growth is the sign of progress. And to a certain extent, it’s true. We love to see our kids grow. We love to see nature growing in spring. Growth is a wonderful,
healthy phase of life. But in our economies, it’s like we’ve
turned to Peter Pan economics— the economy that never wanted to grow up. It wanted to grow and grow and grow
forever. And it becomes this permanent phase. But we already know, in our own bodies,
in our own lives, that there’s another side to this metaphor
of growth that we love so much. If I told you, my friend
had gone to the doctor, and the doctor told her she had a growth, that already feels completely different. Because in the space of our own bodies, we know that when something 
tries to grow endlessly within this healthy, dynamic living whole, it is a threat to the health of the whole, and we do everything we can to stop it. But when we step into our economies,
for some reason, we think that endless growth is progress. And we are now running
into severe problems because we are addicted to endless growth. Simon Kuznets, he was asked in the 1930s
by US Congress to come up, for the first time, with a single number 
to measure the output of the economy. America could say we produced so many tons
of steel and so many bags of grain— but can we add it all together? So they commissioned him 
to do this and he said, “Yes, I can. I can add it all together
in one number.” National income, what we now know as GDP—
but he gave it with a caveat. He said the welfare of a nation can
scarcely be known from this number, don’t mix it up with welfare, right? Because it tells us nothing about 
the unpaid caring work of parents, tells us nothing about the value
that’s created in communities, because that’s not priced, and it’s a measure of the flow 
of economic value. It tells us nothing about the
living world, the forests, the mines that get run down in order
to create this value. But the convenience, the temptation,
of this single number was so great that politicians sort of tucked it 
in their armpit and carried right on. And we ended up in a horse race
of pursuing GDP growth. The dream is that GDP can
keep on increasing, we can have increasing financial returns, but that we can decouple
from using Earth’s resources. We can use less carbon and less metals,
and minerals and plastics, and we can use less 
of the Earth’s land surface, and separate these two: 
ever rising GDP and falling resource use. It’s a fabulous dream; 
would that it would be true. We are at a time of climate emergency,
of ecosystem collapse. We need to radically reduce 
our use of Earth’s resources, and we're nowhere close to that. So I offer it as a compass for 21st
century prosperity. And this compass, silly though it sounds, it looks like a doughnut 
with the hole in the middle. So imagine from the center of it,
humanity’s use of Earth’s resources radiating out from the middle
of that picture. So in the hole, 
in the middle of the doughnut, that is the place where people 
don’t have enough resources to meet the essentials of life. It’s where people don’t have enough
food or health care, or education or housing or gender equality
or political voice or access to energy. And we want to leave nobody in that hole. We want to get everybody over a social
foundation of well-being, so all people on this planet can
lead lives of dignity and opportunity and community. And in low income countries, 
it absolutely makes sense, yes, let’s see the economy grow in ways 
that invest in health and education and transport for all. That was a very 20th century project. We're in the 21st century. We have Earth system scientists
who started looking at the impact we were having on the climate,
and the loss of soils and acid rain, and the hole in the ozone layer,
and the collapse of species. And they said, hang on. We’ve been ignoring our planet. In the growing to meet human needs, 
we have ignored the fact that we are deeply dependent 
on this delicately balanced living planet. It’s the only one we know of out there. And when we use Earth’s resources 
in such a way that we begin to push ourselves beyond
the living capacities of this planet, we are literally undermining the life
supporting systems on which we depend. So, hang on, just as there’s 
an inner limit of resource use, and we call out poverty and deprivation, there’s an outer limit of humanity’s
resource use. That’s ecological degradation. And we are breaking down
this planet on which we depend. So there you get the doughnut,
you get the inside, which is leave nobody behind in the hole. But don’t overshoot the outer ring either. And so the shape of progress
is fundamentally changed. It’s no longer this ever rising line
exponential growth, that we hear about in the financial news 
all the time. It’s balance. To me, a source of real hope is 
that we deeply understand this at the level of our body. You go to the doctor, the doctor will say, have enough food, but not too much, 
enough water, oxygen, exercise, sleep, anything you like— 
have enough, but not too much. Our health lies in balance. And if we can take that metaphor 
from the human body to the planetary body, we give ourselves a cracking
chance of understanding the deep interdependence of our world.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means
to quickly identify bacterial as well as viral threats and to effectively mobilize against them. We also have access to technologies
like test kits, masks to deter the spread 
of respiratory viruses, and vaccines; and we conduct robust trials to make
sure they’re safe and effective. But some things don’t change: we still depend on the courage
and compassion of medical professionals who voluntarily risk their lives against an invisible attacker to help
and comfort those who need it most.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The year is 1656. Your body is wracked 
by violent chills. Your head pounds,
your muscles are too weak to sit up, and you feel like rancid, hard-boiled eggs are squeezing out of your neck 
and armpits. In your feverish state, you see 
a strange-looking man approach, his face obscured by a beak-like mask,
his body covered from head to toe. He examines you 
and even without seeing his face, you know the diagnosis: you have the plague. The plague stands out as one of the most 
terrifying and destructive diseases in human history. It swept across large parts of Afro-
Eurasia in three separate pandemics starting in the 6th, 14th,
and 19th centuries; killed tens of millions of people, and had— in the best of cases— 
about a 40% survival rate. The European plague doctor, with his
beaked mask and wizard-like robes, is one of the images most popularly
associated with plague today. He’s often found in books and films 
about the 14th century pandemic known as the Black Death. The only problem is
that’s about as accurate as placing a modern surgeon at the court
of Louis the 14th in Versailles. The confusion is understandable though— the Black Death had several aftershocks, including a series of devastating
outbreaks in Western Europe during the 17th century. This is when the iconic plague doctor
actually emerged on the scene. First described in the early 17th century, the outfit consisted of a hood 
with crystal eyepieces and a beak filled with a pungent 
combination of herbs and compounds. This could include cinnamon, pepper,
turpentine, roast copper, and powdered viper flesh. This recipe was inspired by the famed
2nd century Greco-Roman physician Galen, and was thought to ward off poisoned air
known as miasma. People believed this bad air
spread plague after emanating from swamps and sources of decay, such as dead plants or animal carcasses. In earlier centuries, doctors across
Europe carried metal pomanders filled with similar mixtures, and it’s possible that the beak evolved
as a hands-free alternative. The rest of the costume, which included 
an oiled leather robe, boots and gloves, acted as kind of an early hazmat suit, likely designed to block miasma 
from entering through the skin’s pores. While this shows some basic understanding
that plague spread from one place to another, these doctors couldn’t know that,
in most cases, the true culprit was a tiny flea 
transmitting the bacteria, Yersinia pestis, 
from one person or animal to another. It’s possible that the plague doctor’s
outfit may have provided some unintentional protection 
from flea bites. However, not enough information
survives to know whether the costumed doctors fared any better than
their ordinarily robed counterparts. It's no surprise that this bizarre getup
has captured popular imagination, despite the fact that its use was limited
to a few places in Italy and France during the 17th and early 18th centuries. Even at the time, it was viewed
with macabre fascination and occasionally used to mock
the ineffective and corrupt practices of some physicians. Until the 20th century, there was 
no effective treatment for the plague, but that didn’t stop doctors— 
costumed or not— from trying. They consulted the works of earlier
physicians for guidance, did what they could to fend off miasma, and prescribed a variety 
of concoctions and antidotes. They also relied on pre-modern
medical mainstays. These could include bloodletting, which involved draining (sometimes 
concerningly large amounts of) blood in an attempt to remove poison 
or restore the body’s natural balance. Or cupping, where the rim 
of a heated glass was placed over swollen lymph nodes 
in hopes of making them burst sooner— a sign, when it occurred naturally,
that a plague patient was on the mend. Or— perhaps most painfully—
cautery, which involved lancing the lymph nodes
with a red-hot poker to release the blackened pus within. A lot has changed since their times. Modern medicine has given us the means

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

**Transcript**:
In the years before World War Two, a pair of brothers worked together
as shoemakers in the German town of Herzogenaurach. But during the war, the siblings
had a terrible argument— a fight so explosive it split
the family business in two. At first, the feud only infected 
their newly competing personnel. But over the coming years, this disagreement divided
all of Herzogenaurach. Residents became fiercely
loyal to one brand of shoe. Local businesses chose sides and 
marriage across lines was discouraged. Herzogenaurach eventually became 
known as “the town of bent necks” because its residents looked down 
to ensure they were interacting with members of their group. But could such a serious divide
really be about shoes? Doesn’t it take more significant 
cultural differences to produce this degree of conflict? To answer this question, we can turn 
to social psychologist Henri Tajfel and his collaborators 
at the University of Bristol. This team developed 
the minimal group paradigm, a methodology designed to investigate the minimal conditions required 
to turn people against each other. Their plan was to gather participants 
without the usual factors that lead to hostility, such as religious, ethnic, 
gender, or other cultural differences. Then, they would split into groups, and run them through scenarios
that added one variable at a time to see what stirred up conflict. But first, they needed
a control condition— a pair of groups without any group bias. The researchers told participants
they were being grouped based on their ability to estimate things
correctly or incorrectly; but in reality, 
the groups were totally random. Since the researchers ensured none
of the participants interacted, no one could form any judgments
or personal bonds. Then everyone was given resources
to distribute. Each participant was free to give
resources to members of either group, and importantly, everything was anonymous. So whatever a participant decided, it had no impact on how many resources
they personally would receive. With all the ingredients 
for discrimination removed and no reason for competition
over resources, the scientists assumed this would
make a conflict-free baseline for further research. But even in these groups, where membership was only defined 
by a perceived similarity in possessing an arbitrary skill, individuals still showed in-group bias. They consistently gave more to members
of their own group than the out-group. Later, research went even further, informing participants that the only thing
determining their group membership was a coin flip. But group bias still occurred. The minimal groups of “us” and “them”
were enough. So, in the absence of stereotypes, 
resource conflicts and status differences, what was left? What could possibly account for people 
showing clear preferences for the most temporary and meaningless
of groups? The answer that came to Tajfel 
and his colleagues was social identity. People regularly use group membership 
to help determine their sense of identity. And these minimal group experiments
suggested that simply being categorized as part of a group is enough to link 
that group to a person’s sense of self. Then, in an effort to create
a meaningful identity, participants allocated more resources
to their in-group than the out-group— pursuing their group's interests despite
no clear benefit to themselves as individuals. Variants of these experiments have 
been conducted around the globe, examining how a shared sense 
of “us” can affect our attention, perception, memory, and emotions. The mental processes
behind minimal group distinctions appear to be the same as many of those
that underlie real group identities. So it is possible that these seemingly
insignificant differences can harden into much more serious divides. That said, minimal groups don't
always drive people apart. Bringing individuals together 
in a new group can temporarily help people
overcome entrenched biases. However, these positive effects are easily
negated by external factors that reinforce existing group identities. Ultimately, the psychology of groups
is part of the human condition, and our tendency towards in-group bias
is an undeniable part of that. So it's up to all of us to make
our groups and ourselves as inclusive of others as possible.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules 
to construct a scaffold. Then, the oyster filters the seawater, drawing out calcium and carbonate to
combine them into its building material. It lays this material over the scaffold, which is covered in charged proteins
that attract and guide the calcium carbonate molecules
into layers. The specific arrangement of these protein
scaffolds depends on the mollusk species and their environment, accounting for their vast diversity 
of shell shapes, sizes, and colors. Mollusks carefully control all components 
of their calcium carbonate creations— even manipulating CaCO3 
at the molecular level. Using special proteins, mollusks can produce 
two crystal structures out of CaCO3: calcite and aragonite. Both of these compounds have 
the same chemical composition, but different qualities due to the way
their crystal lattices are arranged. Calcite is the more stable of the two 
and less prone to dissolving over time, so most mollusk shells have 
a sturdy outer layer of calcite. As the slightly more soluble molecule, aragonite can better adapt 
to more or less acidic environments. So most mollusk shells have 
an interior layer of aragonite to maintain their internal pH level. But one form of aragonite is stronger
and more versatile than the rest: nacre. Mollusks make this special material
by placing successive layers of aragonite interspersed with proteins. These layers are stacked
like hexagonal bricks, each surrounded by other organic material
that directs their orientation. The uniform layering and brick-like
structure of nacre is key to its signature iridescence. The layers are similar in thickness 
to the wavelength of visible light, so the light reflecting 
from its interior surface interferes with the light reflecting 
from the outer surface. When particles of light strike the nacre, they bounce around its multilayered 
crystalline structure in a cascade of shifting rainbows. But nacre isn’t just pretty— it’s one of the strongest and lightest
biomaterials we know of. And it's not just oysters that produce it. In fact, numerous mollusk
species deploy nacre as one of their primary
defense mechanisms. If an intruding parasite or even a stray
particle of sand irritates the mantle, the mollusk will coat the offender 
in nacre-producing cells to form what’s known as a pearl sac. These cells wrap the threat in layers 
of proteins and aragonite until eventually the cocoon 
completely absorbs the invader— dissolving the threat into an opalescent 
sphere of nacre. This defense mechanism is our leading
theory for mollusks making pearls; transforming everyday intruders
into timeless treasures.

**Transcript**:
While most people wouldn’t consider
the crusty exterior of an oyster to be particularly beautiful, opening up this craggy case might reveal
an exquisite jewel nestled within. Yet, despite their iridescent colors
and smooth shapes, pearls are actually made 
of the exact same material as the shell that surrounds them. Pearls, urchin spines, the shells 
of mussels, snails and clams, even coral— all these structures are made 
out of the same chemical compound: calcium carbonate. So, how does this single ingredient form
such a vast array of materials? Calcium carbonate, or CaCO3, 
is common on land, and even more bountiful in the sea. The Earth’s crust is rich in calcium, and over millennia these deposits 
have seeped into rivers and oceans. This is especially true 
near hydrothermal vents, where hot seawater mingles 
with calcium rich basalts. Meanwhile, when carbon dioxide in the air
interacts with seawater it eventually produces
dissolved carbonate. Every year, the ocean absorbs roughly
one third of our carbon dioxide emissions, adding huge quantities of carbonate
into the water. It’s no surprise that sea creatures have
made use of these abundant compounds, but the way calcium and carbonate are
woven together into various shapes is surprisingly artful. Let’s return to the humble oyster. Like many aquatic mollusks,
oysters start life as exposed larvae, and quickly get to work building
a protective shell. First, an organ called the mantle secretes
an organic matrix of proteins and other molecules

**Transcript**:
The Black Death. The 1918 Flu Pandemic. COVID-19. We tend to think of these catastrophic, 
world-changing pandemics as very unlikely events. But between 1980 and 2020, at least three diseases emerged 
that caused global pandemics. COVID-19, yes, but also 
the 2009 swine flu and HIV/AIDS. Disease outbreaks are surprisingly common. Over the past four centuries, the longest stretch of time 
without a documented outbreak that killed at least 10,000 people
was just four years. As bad as these smaller outbreaks are, they’re far less deadly than
a COVID-19-level pandemic. In fact, many people born after 
the 1918 flu lived their entire lives without experiencing
a similar world-changing pandemic. What’s the probability that you do, too? There are several ways 
to answer this question. You could look at history. A team of scientists and engineers 
who took this approach catalogued all documented epidemics 
and pandemics between 1600 and 1950. They used that data to do two things. First, to graph the likelihood 
that an outbreak of any size pops up somewhere in the world 
over a set period of time. And second, to estimate the likelihood
that that outbreak would get large enough to kill a certain percentage
of the world's population. This graph shows that while huge
pandemics are unlikely, they're not that unlikely. The team used these two distributions
to estimate that the risk of a COVID-19-level pandemic 
is about 0.5% per year, and could be as high as 1.4% if new diseases emerge 
more frequently in the future. And we’ll come back to those numbers, but first, let’s look at another way
to estimate the likelihood of a future pandemic: modeling one from the ground up. For most pandemics to happen, a pathogen,
which is a microbe that can cause disease, has to spill over from its normal host by
making contact with and infecting a human. Then, the pathogen has to spread widely, crossing international boundaries
and infecting lots of people. Many variables determine whether a given
spillover event becomes a pandemic. For example, the type of pathogen, 
how often humans come into close contact with its animal reservoir, 
existing immunity, and so on. Viruses are prime candidates 
to cause the next big pandemic. Scientists estimate that there are about
1.7 million as-yet-undiscovered viruses that currently infect mammals and birds, and that roughly 40% of these have the
potential to spill over and infect humans. A team of scientists built a model
using this information, as well as data about the global
population, air travel networks, how people move around in communities,
country preparedness levels, and how people might respond to pandemics. The model generated hundreds of thousands
of virtual pandemics. The scientists then used 
this catalog to estimate that the probability of another 
COVID-19-level pandemic is 2.5 to 3.3% per year. To get a sense of how these risks
play out over a lifetime, let’s pick a value roughly in the middle
of all these estimates: 2%. Now let’s build what’s called 
a probability tree diagram to model all possible scenarios. The first branch of the tree
represents the first year: there’s a 2% probability of experiencing
a COVID-19-level pandemic, which means there’s a 98% probability 
of not experiencing one. Second branch, same thing, Third branch, same. And so on, 72 more times. There is only one path that results
in a fully pandemic-free lifetime: 98%, or 0.98,
multiplied by itself 75 times, which comes out to roughly 22%. So the likelihood of living through 
at least one more COVID 19-level-pandemic in the next 75 years 
is 100 minus 22%, or 78%. 78%! If we use the most optimistic
yearly estimate— 0.5%— the lifetime probability drops to 31%. If we use the most pessimistic one,
it jumps to 92%. Even 31% is too high to ignore; even if we get lucky, 
future generations might not. Also, pandemics are usually
random, independent events: so even if the yearly probability 
of a COVID-19-level pandemic is 1%, we could absolutely get another
one in ten years. The good news is we now have tools 
that make pandemics less destructive. Scientists estimated that early warning
systems, contact tracing, social distancing, 
and other public health measures saved over a million lives 
in just the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, not to mention the millions
of lives saved by vaccines. One day, another pandemic
will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

will sweep the globe. But we can work to make that day
less likely to be tomorrow. We can reduce the risk
of spillover events, and we can contain spillovers
that do happen so they don’t become full-blown pandemics. Imagine how the future might
look if we interacted with the animal world more carefully, and if we had well-funded, open-access 
global disease monitoring programs, AI-powered contact tracing
and isolation measures, universal vaccines, 
next-generation antiviral drugs, and other tech we haven't even thought of. It’s in our power to change 
these probabilities. So, we have a choice: we could do nothing
and hope we get lucky. Or we could take the threat 
seriously enough that it becomes a self-defeating prophecy. Which future would you rather live in?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

**Transcript**:
Smallpox is one of the deadliest
diseases in history, but fortunately, it’s been eradicated
for over 40 years. However, samples of the virus 
that causes smallpox still exist, leading to concern that rogue actors
might try to weaponize it. This is especially worrying because older smallpox vaccines
can have serious side effects, and modern antiviral drugs have never
been tested against this disease. To protect against this potential threat, the US government is funding research
to improve smallpox treatments and vaccines. And since it’s unethical to expose 
people to a highly lethal virus, labs are using humanity's closest
biological relatives as research subjects. But is it right to harm these animals to
protect humanity from a potential threat? Or should our closest relatives also be
protected against lethal experiments? What would you do as a scientist faced
with this very real scenario? In many ways, this dilemma isn't new. Animals have been used in research aimed
at improving human welfare for centuries, typically at the cost of their lives. This practice reflects the widespread
belief that human lives are more valuable than non-human lives. People have different views about 
the ethics of animal testing and how it’s conducted. But whatever your opinion, this scenario raises an important
philosophical question: how do we determine the value of a life,
whether human or non-human? One tool philosophers have used 
to consider this question is moral status. Beings with moral status
should have their needs and interests taken into consideration by those 
making decisions that impact them. Traditionally, moral status
has been seen as binary— either a being’s interests matter 
for their own sake, or they don’t. And historically, many philosophers
believed that humans had moral status and other animals didn’t. Some contemporary philosophers
like Shelly Kagan have argued that moral status
comes in degrees, but even in this model, he argues 
that people have the most moral status. However, determining what grants any
degree of moral status can be difficult. Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant
thought humans have moral status because of their rational nature 
and ability to will their actions. A binary conception of moral status then
suggests that beings with these capacities are “persons” bearing full moral status, while all other creatures are “things”
without moral status. But thinkers like Christine Korsgaard 
have argued a Kantian view should include many non-human animals 
because of how they value their own good. Another line of argument, suggested 
by utilitarianism’s founding father Jeremy Bentham and elaborated
by Peter Singer, claims that a capacity for suffering makes an entity worthy 
of moral consideration. These inclusive ways of thinking about
moral status dramatically widen the scope of our moral responsibility, in ways some people might find unnerving. So where do our monkeys stand? Our closest genetic relatives have
high social and intellectual capacities. They live cooperatively 
in complex social groups and recognize members 
of their community as individuals. They support and learn from one another— there’s even evidence 
they respond to inequality. And of course,
they’re capable of suffering. Yet despite all this, 
it’s still generally common opinion that a human’s life is more valuable
than a monkey’s. And that while killing one human 
to save five others is typically wrong, killing one monkey to save five humans 
is regrettable, but morally acceptable. Even morally required. At some point, however, 
this calculation starts to feel unstable. Should we kill 100 monkeys 
to save five people? How about 10,000? If moral status is binary and monkeys
don't have it, then theoretically, any number of monkeys could be sacrificed
to save just one person. But if moral status comes in degrees
and monkeys have any at all, then at some point the balance will tip. The situation you're in complicates
things even further. Unlike the scenarios above, there's no guarantee your work
will ever save human lives. This is true of any animal experiment— the process of scientific discovery only
sometimes leads to improved medical care. But in your case,
it’s even trickier! While the government is worried smallpox
might be weaponized, if they’re wrong
the disease will remain eradicated, and your research won’t save
anyone from smallpox. You could try to quantify this uncertainty
to help make your decision. But how do you determine what 
an acceptable amount of risk is? And what if there’s so much uncertainty
that your calculations are essentially wild guesses? These kinds of moral mathematics
get complicated fast, and some philosophers would
argue they’re not even the best way to make moral decisions. But whatever you decide, 
your choice should be well justified.

**Transcript**:
- A blood moon lunar eclipse
wasn't always something to look forward to. When the moon turned red thousands of years ago, the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians feared
that something monstrous and evil was eating the moon. They would shout at the night sky to try and fend off the ravenous beasts and since the average lunar eclipse lasts around 100 minutes, and the moon returns to normal afterward, they
were probably convinced that their whooping and
howling actually worked. We know now that the moon
doesn't need our protection, but why does it turn
red in the first place? (peaceful music) Whenever you look up at a full moon, you're seeing sunlight that's reflected off the lunar surface, so if something were
to block that sunlight say, the earth, then in theory, the moon should disappear from view but during a total lunar eclipse when the moon passes
through the earth's shadow, we get a red moon, not a vanishing one. So what's going on? To figure it out, let's take a quick trip to the lunar surface. This is a NASA simulation
of what the earth looks like during a total lunar eclipse. Notice the red ring around our planet. Everywhere you see that
ring is either a sunrise or a sunset, and while
it's true that no direct sunlight is reaching the lunar surface at this moment, earth's
atmosphere is bending the red wavelengths of
light around the planet, so that redness you see
during a blood moon eclipse is a combination of
light from every sunrise and sunset on earth,
all happening at once. So the moon appears
red for the same reason that sunrises and sunsets on earth are red because of a phenomenon
called Rayleigh Scattering. Named after the British
physicist, John William Strutt, also known as Lord
Rayleigh, who discovered it in the late 19th century. It describes how different
colors of sunlight interact with the earth's atmosphere. Look at the sky during
daytime, for example. It appears blue because air molecules in earth's atmosphere scatter
blue light more easily than red, but during sunrise and sunset, the light travels through
more of earth's atmosphere before reaching your eye
which has two consequences. First, it means more overall
sunlight is scattered, making the sun appear dimmer. That's why you can easily
gaze upon the sun at sunset compared to at high noon. And secondly, more scattering
means more blue light is scattered away, leaving the
redder wavelengths behind. Similarly, the ring around earth during a total lunar eclipse is red because the sunlight travels
through a long stretch of earth's atmosphere, from one end of the planet to the other. So rather than fear a blood
moon like the ancient Mayans and Mesopotamians, why not think
of it as a romantic moment? After all, it's the only time
when you can see the sunrise and sunset simultaneously. (peaceful music)

**Transcript**:
This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

**Transcript**:
This round structure is only about 
ten billionths of a meter in diameter, but it— as well as other technologies
in the pipeline— could be stepping stones to a monumental
public health ambition: a single vaccine that protects you 
against everything. We’ll get back to the grand vision later,
but first, let’s start with something that’s
being developed now: a vaccine that would protect you 
against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies

against every strain of the flu— even ones that don’t exist yet. Here’s one flu virus particle. On the inside is the virus’ RNA, and on the outside are lots and lots
of hemagglutinin proteins. Hemagglutinin attaches to a receptor
on a human cell and fuses the viral and human membranes, 
starting the infection. Hemagglutinin is also one of the things
your immune system recognizes and reacts to the most. To understand how this works, think of hemagglutinin as a bust of 19th
century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Croissant! If you show Napoleon to an immune system
and say, “remember him,” the immune system will mostly
focus on his head. And the same is true 
for the real hemagglutinin. One way the immune system 
remembers things is by physically interacting with them. Think of it as making plaster molds
of parts of the head: we call these molds antibodies. The antibodies float around your
bloodstream for a while and then can diminish, but blueprints on how to make them 
are stored in specialized memory cells, waiting for future Napoleons to invade. Here’s the thing, though. Hemagglutinin is constantly mutating. Most mutations are subtle, produced by single letter changes 
in the virus’ RNA: like this or this. Over time, Napoleon-slash-hemagglutinin’s
head can change enough that our antibodies become less good
at recognizing it. This is called antigenic drift. Influenza is constantly drifting; that’s one reason you have to get
a new flu shot every year. But sometimes bigger changes happen. An animal, usually a pig, can
get infected with, say, a human flu and a bird flu. And those different viruses might
infect the same cell. If that happens, the two different viral
genomes can recombine in tens or even hundreds of ways. The human flu virus could 
pick up a bird flu hemagglutinin that’s never infected humans before. This is called antigenic shift, and if you get infected 
by this version of influenza, none of the antibodies against Napoleon's
head are going to help you. Antigenically shifted viruses
have the potential to infect many people very quickly, causing epidemics and sometimes pandemics. A truly universal flu vaccine would be
able to protect against current flu strains 
and future drifted or shifted strains. But how do we design a vaccine 
against a strain that doesn’t exist yet? We look to the past. There are key parts of hemagglutinin
that haven’t changed much over time and are probably critical
to infect human cells; these “conserved regions” could be 
promising targets for universal vaccines. But there's a problem that's hindered
classical vaccine production. Many conserved regions are in the neck, and it’s tough to get the immune system
to react to the neck. Also, because influenza-like viruses have
been around for hundreds of millions of years, there may not be a single region 
that’s common across all species and subtypes of influenza. But there’s promising science
in development. Remember this? This is a protein called ferritin; Its normal purpose is 
to store and move iron. But it’s also the rough size and shape
of a small virus. And if you attach viral proteins to it,
like this, you’d have something that looks,
to an immune system, like a virus— but would be completely harmless
and very engineerable. Recently, scientists engineered 
a ferritin nanoparticle to present 8 identical copies 
of the neck region of an H1 flu virus. They vaccinated mice 
with the nanoparticle, then injected them with a lethal dose 
of a completely different subtype, H5N1. All the vaccinated mice lived; 
all the unvaccinated ones died. Going one step beyond that, there may be conserved regions 
that we could take advantage of across different-but-related 
virus species— like SARS-CoV-2, MERS, and a few coronaviruses 
which cause some common colds. Over the past few decades, a different part of the immune system
has come into clearer focus. Instead of antibodies, 
this part of the immune system uses a vast array of T cells that kill,
for example, cells that have been infected by a virus. Vaccines that train this part
of the immune system, in addition to the antibody response,
could provide broader protection. A universal flu vaccine would be a
monumental achievement in public health. A fully universal vaccine against all
infectious disease is— for the moment— squarely in the realm of science fiction, partially because we have no idea 
how our immune system would react if we tried to train it against hundreds 
of different diseases at the same time. Probably not well. But that doesn’t mean it’s impossible. Look at where medicine is today compared
to where it was two centuries ago. Who knows what it’ll look like
in another 50 or 100 years— maybe some future groundbreaking
technology will bring truly universal vaccines
within our grasp.

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that
it benefits them more than others, they create a feedback loop where power
and everything that flows with it calcifies within their families. And then you’ve got, basically, 
an aristocracy. So let’s break down the question
we started with: is pure, “invisible hand” capitalism, with all the dials set to the extremes,
broken? Yeah. But it’s also kind of irrelevant,
since no country uses pure capitalism. Is contemporary capitalism— as it’s practiced in much 
of the world today— broken? Well, it’s the major driver
of climate change and in many places is contributing
to rising inequality. And it may even be creating a de facto
aristocracy in certain countries, so, not looking good. The critical question is: 
can we fix contemporary capitalism by fiddling with the dials
or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Each one of these machines represents
the economic system of a country. Every machine has three inputs: labor, people’s work. Capital, all the stuff 
that a business might use, including intangibles, like ideas. And natural resources. The machine converts these inputs
into goods and services, and because we’re willing to pay 
for the things the machine produces, what the machine is really creating here
is value. Economies turn inputs into value. What determines whether the machine
is capitalist, communist, socialist, or something else? Three dials. The first dial controls 
who owns the capital. Over here, the government owns 
every bit of capital, down to the last office paperclip. North Korea is probably 
the closest economy to 0%. On the other end of the spectrum, at 100%,
private citizens own all the capital. The US is about here, 
at roughly two-thirds private ownership. The second dial dictates how much control 
the government has over what gets produced. In economies with high coordination, 
like the old USSR, the government dictated what the economy
could— and would— produce. In economies with low coordination, the government might mandate a few things, but leaves most decision-making
up to the private sector. The third dial controls how extensively
markets are used to set prices. Over here at 0%, we have economies
with no markets, where the government sets all prices,
and consumers have no say. Over here at 100%, markets are used to set 
the price of everything, even things like basic 
life-saving health care. You can also think of this dial
as controlling the number and extent of government regulations— from tariffs on foreign goods 
to antitrust laws to regulations on net neutrality. So, capitalism isn’t just
one type of economy— it’s a wide range of possible economies, which makes answering the question of
whether capitalism is broken, complicated. But we’re going to try. At the height 
of the Industrial Revolution, the dials were set pretty close 
to what we now call free market, or “laissez-faire” capitalism. There were very few regulations, and economists of the time believed
that capitalism’s “invisible hand”— basically, individuals acting freely
and in their own self-interest— would produce optimal outcomes,
both for the economy and for society. And that’s how we ended 
up with embalming fluid in milk. In the late 1800s in the United States, 
food manufacturers put all kinds of cheap (and sometimes dangerous) adulterants
in food to maximize profits. What they were doing was legal,
but of course, wrong. There was a public outcry, 
and in 1906, Congress passed 
the Pure Food and Drugs Act, setting the stage 
for the Food and Drug Administration, which watches over the US’s
food supply to this day. These days, no economy really practices
pure “invisible hand” capitalism, but some people are increasingly worried
that today’s threats, like climate change and rising inequality,
can’t be solved by any capitalist system. Let’s look at climate change first. Capitalist economies incentivize growth. That’s created massive demand 
for the cheapest energy possible, which, for a long time, was fossil fuels. Burning all those fossil fuels
unquestionably drove— and continues to drive— climate change. Not only that, but the desire to maximize
profit usually gives corporations a powerful incentive to ignore
inconvenient truths. Just like tobacco companies denied 
the link between cigarettes and cancer, oil and gas companies denied 
or downplayed climate science for decades. Next, inequality. Inequality is complicated enough that
we made a whole video about it, but the simple story is: in many countries, inequality is rising. In the US, the UK, Canada, Ireland, 
and Australia, the top 1% of income earners have been
eating up a larger and larger share of total income over the past 50 years. In the UK, the top 1% share doubled
from 7% in 1980 to 14% in 2014. But that's not the whole picture. In England, the country for which we have
the best data before capitalism, the share of income going
to the top 5% of income earners peaked at around 40% in 1801, and then, as capitalism took hold, it fell
steadily to a low of about 17% in 1977. These days, it’s back up— 
hovering around 26%. And here’s another data point: 
in many European countries and Japan, the top 1%’s share of income came
down from 20 to 25% in the early 1900s to 7 to 12% today. So, is capitalism increasing inequality
or not? It depends. Remember, there's a wide range of settings
that all fall under capitalism, meaning that one country's version can
look very different from another's. It’s totally possible that inequality
could be increasing in China’s version of capitalism, 
while it decreases in France’s. Capitalism, it seems, 
is a double-edged sword. On the one hand,
it generates a huge amount of value, which translates to almost everyone having
more money than they otherwise would. On the other hand, it also funnels
the biggest chunk of that money into the wallets of relatively few people. Capitalism’s staunchest defenders say 
that with enough grit and determination, anyone can join the ranks of the wealthy. Is that really true? In a free, capitalist market, the wealth generated by successful
companies mostly flows to the owners. And along with that come 
other benefits: education, health, social standing,
and power. If owners tinker with the machine so that

or restricting who can turn them, or do we need to tear the machine down
and build a new one from scratch?

**Transcript**:
Mumbling fantastical gibberish;
devouring blocks of cheese in the nude; peeing in places that aren’t toilets;
and jumping out of windows. These are all things people have
reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,
while others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead 
to partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote
deeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,
and operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— 
like stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea 
and restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate 
these factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, 
such as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient 
sleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend 
safety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing 
door alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider
certain medications. But many of the available treatments
for sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective
they are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do 
if you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing
a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them
can cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be 
to gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure
they’re safe until the episode resolves.

reportedly done while sleepwalking, a behavior that’s mostly benign 
but can be dangerous in rare cases. It's estimated that around 18% of people
sleepwalk at least once in their lives. So, what exactly is sleepwalking? First, we have to understand just how
many of our daily activities do not require our active attention. Your prefrontal cortex is
your brain's conscious, deliberate, decision-making control hub. You might decide to get up and walk
using your prefrontal cortex, but the intricate coordination
of sensory inputs and muscles that follows does 
not require any attention. Instead, it’s mostly executed 
by a network of specialized nerve cells along the lower part of the brain 
and spinal cord, sometimes called
“central pattern generators.” These areas govern automatic movements
and basic actions related to survival. People with a REM sleep behavior disorder
may enact their dreams while they’re in REM sleep, usually keeping their eyes closed. However, this is a separate condition. Sleepwalking arises from a very different
stage of sleep— the deepest stage of non-REM sleep,
which is called “slow-wave sleep.” In this state, the cortex, 
including the prefrontal cortex, is essentially turned off. When someone is roused from this stage, they’ll usually appear groggy 
before either dozing off again or becoming fully conscious. For that moment, though, 
they’re in an intermediate state straddling sleep and wakefulness. A sleepwalking episode is, essentially,
an extreme, prolonged version of this. When sleepwalking, 
the prefrontal cortex remains inactive, so the person doesn’t possess executive,
deliberate control over their actions. But other parts of their brain are active. And, as we know, 
the body is capable of a lot without involving the prefrontal cortex. Sleepwalkers
avoid obstacles, walk, and speak— though it's often nonsense. Most sleepwalkers can do basic things, operating in a peaceful, unemotional, 
dreamless state. In rare cases, sleepwalkers perform more 
complex tasks like cooking and driving. They're occasionally guided
by physical urges, like eating or pursuing sexual activities. And some episodes involve the brain’s
fight or flight system, during which the person might suddenly 
perceive an imminent danger, and vocalize, cry, or even jolt out of bed
and run away. These episodes, 
called “sleep terrors,” are more common in young children
and usually result naturally. Indeed, sleepwalking is generally
more common in children, perhaps because the brain areas 
that control the transition between sleep and wakefulness
are still developing. But the exact mechanisms that cause
sleepwalking remain unclear. Many cases appear to run in families,
while others are more mysterious. Anything that could lead 
to partial awakening is thought to increase the likelihood. This includes factors that promote
deeper slow-wave sleep— like sedatives, hot sleep environments,
and operating on too little sleep— or things that disrupt sleep— 
like stress and other sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea 
and restless leg syndrome. Doctors will usually evaluate 
these factors and promote habits that aid in healthy sleep, 
such as exercise, stress management, and a consistent and sufficient 
sleep schedule. They’ll also often recommend 
safety measures, like hiding dangerous items, installing 
door alarms and securing windows. If this doesn't help, they'll consider
certain medications. But many of the available treatments
for sleepwalking haven’t yet been rigorously studied, so how they work and how effective
they are is not entirely clear. So, what should you do 
if you encounter a sleepwalker? A common misconception is that rousing
a sleepwalker causes irreparable harm. Fortunately, this is not true. However, trying to forcefully wake them
can cause confusion and distress. The best practice seems to be 
to gently guide them back to bed; and, if they resist, to simply ensure
they’re safe until the episode resolves.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly

the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2000, a company called ViroPharma
ran clinical trials of pleconaril, a new pill designed to treat 
the common cold. In many patients, the pill helped. But in 7 of them, 
just a few days into the treatment, researchers found mutated virus variants
that were almost completely resistant to pleconaril. Viruses are always mutating, but this one
mutated so quickly that it managed to outmaneuver years of research 
and development in just a few days. If you didn't have an immune
system and caught a cold, the infection would quickly spread
deep into your lungs. Rampant viral replication would destroy
tissue there, until your lungs couldn’t supply your body
with enough oxygen and you’d asphyxiate. Unfortunately, for millions of people
around the world who live with a less-than-fully-functional
immune system or who are on immunosuppressant drugs, this is a real risk: “minor” infections can turn serious
or even deadly. But if you're fortunate enough to have
a fully functional immune system, a cold will probably give you 
a few relatively mild symptoms. On average, adults catch more than
150 colds throughout their lives. And despite the fact 
that the symptoms are similar, the cause could be different each time. Common colds are caused by at least
8 different families of virus, each of which can have 
its own species and subtypes. How can so many different viruses
cause the same illness? Well, viruses can only invade
our bodies in a few ways: one is to come in on a breath. We have to breathe, so our immune system 
sets up a bunch of frontline defenses and these are actually what produce
many of the symptoms of a cold. Your mucus-y, dripping nose is your immune
system trapping and flushing out virus. Your fever is your immune system 
raising your body temperature to slow down viral replication. And your inflamed, well, everything, that’s your immune system
widening your blood vessels and recruiting its white blood cell army
to help kill the virus. So, if the common cold is caused
by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation

by many different viruses, is a cure even possible? Here’s one fact in our favor: a single family of viruses causes 
30 to 50% of all colds: rhinovirus. If we could eliminate all
rhinovirus infections, we’d be a long way towards curing
the common cold. There are two main ways to fight a virus:
vaccines and antiviral drugs. The first attempt to create a rhinovirus
vaccine was a success— but a short-lived one. In 1957, William Price vaccinated 50 kids 
with inactivated rhinovirus and gave 50 others a placebo. Soon afterwards, a rhinovirus outbreak 
spread throughout the kids. In the vaccinated group, only 3 got sick. In the placebo group, 23 did— 
almost 8 times as many. And despite the small numbers, 
this was promising: the immune systems of vaccinated kids 
were successfully recognizing and responding to rhinovirus. But later trials of the vaccine showed
no protection at all— none. This wasn’t Price’s fault— no one at the time knew that rhinovirus
had multiple subtypes. Price’s vaccine, 
for reasons we don’t fully understand, didn't provide broad protection, meaning it was only effective against one
or maybe a few subtypes of rhinovirus— out of 169 subtypes and counting. Sometimes, when we make a vaccine, 
we get lucky. The mRNA COVID vaccines, for example, effectively protect us against severe
disease and death across the original virus 
and variants too. But we have yet to create a broadly
protective vaccine against rhinovirus, or any other virus that causes
the common cold. Okay, what about antiviral drugs? Viruses hijack human cellular machinery
to replicate and spread, so it’s hard to make a molecule
that’s toxic to the virus without also being toxic to the human. And even if you manage to do that, the virus could mutate 
out of reach of the drug. Viruses are slippery beasts. We have, though, had some
incredible successes: we eradicated smallpox thanks
to an effective vaccine, the fact that it can’t hide
out in other species, and its relatively low mutation rate. HIV, on the other hand, mutates so quickly
that in an untreated individual, every possible single-letter mutation
in the virus’s genetic code could, in theory,
be produced in a single day. Despite trying for decades, 
we still don’t have a vaccine. But we do have an effective
cocktail of HIV drugs that the virus can’t easily mutate 
away from. Unfortunately, 
we are stuck with colds for now. But the last few decades have featured
some entirely game-changing medical breakthroughs,
like mRNA vaccines and CRISPR. CRISPR could be particularly promising
as an antiviral agent, because it originally evolved in bacteria
as an immune defense against viruses. In fact, early in the COVID-19 pandemic, a research team showed that 
a CRISPR system could degrade coronavirus and influenza genomes
in our lung cells. They called their system prophylactic
antiviral CRISPR in human cells. Or, for short, PAC-MAN.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

**Transcript**:
In South Africa, one of the most
unequal countries in the world, the richest one-tenth of 1%, owns 
almost 30% of all the country’s wealth, more than double what the bottom 90% owns. Income and wealth inequality are not new. In fact, economists and historians 
who’ve charted economic inequality throughout history haven’t found 
a single society without it. Which raises a bleak question: is inequality inevitable? One way to estimate inequality is 
with a number called the Gini index, which is calculated by comparing 
the income or wealth distribution of a perfectly equal society to the 
actual income or wealth distribution. The area of this shape multiplied
by 2 is the Gini index. A Gini of 1 indicates
perfect inequality— one person has everything 
and everyone else has nothing. You’d never see this in real life because everyone except 
that one person would starve. A Gini index of 0 indicates
perfect equality— everyone has exactly 
the same income or wealth. But you also never see this in real life,
not even in communist countries, because for one thing, 
that would mean paying everyone— no matter how young, old,
what job they’re in or where they work— the exact same wage. Typical after-tax Ginis in developed
countries today are around 0.3, though there’s a wide range 
from pretty equal to pretty unequal. Before we go any further, you should
know what the Gini index— or any other measure of economic
inequality— doesn’t tell us: it gives no information about how 
income and wealth are distributed across genders, races, educational 
backgrounds or other demographics; it doesn’t tell us how easy or difficult
it is to escape poverty. And it also gives no insight 
as to how a particular society arrived at its present level 
of inequality. Economic inequality is deeply entangled
with other types of inequality: for example, generations 
of discrimination, imperialism, and colonialism created deeply rooted 
power and class inequalities that persist to this day. But we still need at least a rough measure
of who gets how much in a country. That’s what the Gini index gives us. Some countries are, economically,
much more unequal than others. And that’s because a significant portion
of economic inequality is the result of choices 
that governments make. Let's talk about some of these choices. First: what kind of economy to use. In the 20th century, some countries 
switched  to socialism or communism for a variety of reasons, including reducing economic inequality. These changes did dramatically
reduce economic inequality in the two largest 
non-capitalist economies, China and the Soviet Union—
especially in the Soviet Union. But neither country prospered as much
as the world's leading economies. So yes, people earned about as much
as their neighbors did, but that wasn’t very much. This— and many other issues— contributed 
to the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991. And China, to grow more quickly,
shifted its economy towards capitalism starting in the late 1970s. What about capitalist countries? Can they choose to reduce
economic inequality? It’s tempting to think “no, because the whole point of 
capitalism is to hoard enough gold coins to be able to dive into them 
like Scrooge McDuck.” China seems to provide 
the textbook example of this: after it became more capitalist, its Gini index shot up from under 0.4
to over 0.55. Meanwhile, its per capita yearly income jumped from the rough equivalent 
of $1,500 to over $13,000. But there are many counter-examples: capitalist countries in which inequality
is actually holding steady or decreasing. France has kept its Gini index
below 0.32 since 1979. Ireland's Gini has been trending
mostly downward since 1995. The Netherlands and Denmark have kept
theirs below 0.28 since the 1980s. How do they do it? One way is with taxes. Personal income taxes in most
countries are progressive: the more money you make, 
the higher your tax rate. And the more progressive your tax system,
the more it reduces inequality. So, for example, while pre-tax income
inequality in France is roughly the same as it is in the US, post-tax inequality in France
is roughly 20% lower. Meanwhile, inheritance taxes can reduce
the amount of wealth that a single family can amass
over generations. Germany and many other European
countries have inheritance or estate taxes that kick in at a few thousand
to a few hundred thousand Euros, depending on who's inheriting. The US, on the other hand, lets you inherit $12 million 
without paying any federal tax. Another way is with transfers— when the government takes tax revenues
from one group of people and gives it to another. For example, Social Security programs 
tax people who work and use the revenue to support retirees. In Italy, about a quarter of Italians’
disposable household income comes from government transfers. That’s a lot, 
especially relative to the US, where the figure is just over 5%. A third way is to ensure that everyone
has access to things like education and healthcare. A highly educated, healthy workforce can 
command a higher salary on the market, thus reducing inequality. The fourth way
is addressing the digital divide: the gap between those who have access 
to the Internet and those who do not. A fifth way is dealing
with extreme wealth. Multibillionaires can buy 
social media platforms, news outlets, policy think-tanks,
perhaps even politicians, and bend them to their will, threatening the very fabric of democracy. We are just barely scratching 
the surface of inequality here. We haven’t touched on the drastic divides
in who has wealth and who doesn’t; the power structures that prevent
social and economic mobility; and the drastic inequality 
between countries— the fact that, for example, just three Americans have 
90 billion more dollars than Egypt, a country of 100 million people. And here’s one final thing to think about:
power and wealth are self-reinforcing, which means that equality is not. Left to their own devices, 
societies tend toward inequality— unless we weaken the feedback loops 
of wealth and power concentration.

Everyone loves the idea of parallel universes
- maybe it's the appeal of an ideal world where you have second chances and things turn
out differently - an alternate reality where you do get into Hogwarts and the Star Wars
prequels aren't made and you finally plug in your asymmetric computer cord correctly
on the first try... but is there really a place in science for such wistful speculation? I mean, if "the universe" is everything that
there is, you can't have two versions of it, right? Otherwise the pair would really be everything
and what you started off calling the universe, wasn't. The problem here is terminology: physicists
speaking informally often say "universe" when they really mean "observable universe" - that
is, the part of the whole universe that we've so far been able to see. And it's perfectly fine to talk about multiple
different observable universes - for example, an alien near the edge of OUR observable universe
will see parts of the Whole Universe that we cannot yet see, but that's a well-understood
question and not what physicists normally talk about when they discuss multiple observable
universes, or "multi-verses." So let's cut to the chase: in physics, the
word "Multiverse" normally refers to one of three distinct and largely unrelated proposed
physical models for the universe - none of which has been tested or confirmed by experiment,
by the way. The three "multiverse" models are: Type 1) Bubble universes or baby black hole
universes. This is the most straightforward kind of multiverse:
the basic idea is that perhaps there are other parts of the universe which are so far away
that we will never see them (or are inside black holes so similarly we will never see
them). This kind of model was created as an attempt
to explain why our universe is so good at making stars and galaxies and black holes
and life - as the argument goes, if each of these separate mutually un-seeable "bubbles"
in the universe had slightly different laws of physics, then by definition we could only
exist in one that had the right physical laws to allow us to exist. If you're not convinced by this logic, don't
worry too much: there's not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 2) Membranes and extra dimensions. Inspired in part by the inability of the mathematics
of string theory to predict the right number of dimensions for the universe in which we
live, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is
actually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with
9 spatial dimensions. Kind of like how each page of a newspaper
is its own two-dimensional surface embedded within our three-dimensional world. And of course, if space had 9 dimensions rather
than three, there'd be plenty of space for other three-dimensional surfaces that appeared,
like ours, to be universes in their own right, but, like the pages of a newspaper, were actually
part of a bigger whole. These kinds of surfaces are called "membranes"
or "branes" for short. And as a reminder, there is not yet any experimental
evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 3) The many-worlds picture
of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, physicists still don't fully
understand how the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics happens, and the many-worlds
hypothesis makes an attempt at explanation by proposing that every possible alternate
timeline for the universe is real and they all happen in an ever-larger, ever-branching
way. Like, a universal choose-your-own-adventure
where every possible story happens! If this were the case, we might not realize
it because we'd be stuck living out just one of the infinitely many possible lives available
to us. In some ways, many-worlds is similar to the
bubble multiverse model by proposing "maybe anything that can happen, does. And we just happen to exist in the series
of happenings that were necessary for us to exist." If you're still not convinced by this logic,
don't worry: there is not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Of course if you want to get imaginative,
you could also combine several of these models together into a multi-multiverse... a new
super-speculative model based, itself, on speculative and experimentally unconfirmed
models. But that's not to say we couldn't test these
multiverse hypotheses. For example, if our observable universe were
really just one of many disconnected bubbles or membranes and if it happened to collide
with another bubble or membrane some time in the past, then that collision would certainly
have had some sort of effect on what we see when we look up at the night sky. On the other hand, the many-worlds interpretation
might be tested fairly soon since experimentalists are becoming increasingly able to manipulate
and control ever-larger quantum mechanical systems in their labs - systems that approach
the line between the quantum realm and our everyday experience. So as always, we must remember that physics
is science, not philosophy; and in our attempts to explain the universe that we observe, we
have to make claims that can in principle be tested - and then test them!

live, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is
actually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with
9 spatial dimensions. Kind of like how each page of a newspaper
is its own two-dimensional surface embedded within our three-dimensional world. And of course, if space had 9 dimensions rather
than three, there'd be plenty of space for other three-dimensional surfaces that appeared,
like ours, to be universes in their own right, but, like the pages of a newspaper, were actually
part of a bigger whole. These kinds of surfaces are called "membranes"
or "branes" for short. And as a reminder, there is not yet any experimental
evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 3) The many-worlds picture
of quantum mechanics. Surprisingly, physicists still don't fully
understand how the collapse of the wavefunction in quantum mechanics happens, and the many-worlds
hypothesis makes an attempt at explanation by proposing that every possible alternate
timeline for the universe is real and they all happen in an ever-larger, ever-branching
way. Like, a universal choose-your-own-adventure
where every possible story happens! If this were the case, we might not realize
it because we'd be stuck living out just one of the infinitely many possible lives available
to us. In some ways, many-worlds is similar to the
bubble multiverse model by proposing "maybe anything that can happen, does. And we just happen to exist in the series
of happenings that were necessary for us to exist." If you're still not convinced by this logic,
don't worry: there is not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Of course if you want to get imaginative,
you could also combine several of these models together into a multi-multiverse... a new
super-speculative model based, itself, on speculative and experimentally unconfirmed
models. But that's not to say we couldn't test these
multiverse hypotheses. For example, if our observable universe were
really just one of many disconnected bubbles or membranes and if it happened to collide
with another bubble or membrane some time in the past, then that collision would certainly
have had some sort of effect on what we see when we look up at the night sky. On the other hand, the many-worlds interpretation
might be tested fairly soon since experimentalists are becoming increasingly able to manipulate
and control ever-larger quantum mechanical systems in their labs - systems that approach
the line between the quantum realm and our everyday experience. So as always, we must remember that physics
is science, not philosophy; and in our attempts to explain the universe that we observe, we
have to make claims that can in principle be tested - and then test them!

**Transcript**:
Everyone loves the idea of parallel universes
- maybe it's the appeal of an ideal world where you have second chances and things turn
out differently - an alternate reality where you do get into Hogwarts and the Star Wars
prequels aren't made and you finally plug in your asymmetric computer cord correctly
on the first try... but is there really a place in science for such wistful speculation? I mean, if "the universe" is everything that
there is, you can't have two versions of it, right? Otherwise the pair would really be everything
and what you started off calling the universe, wasn't. The problem here is terminology: physicists
speaking informally often say "universe" when they really mean "observable universe" - that
is, the part of the whole universe that we've so far been able to see. And it's perfectly fine to talk about multiple
different observable universes - for example, an alien near the edge of OUR observable universe
will see parts of the Whole Universe that we cannot yet see, but that's a well-understood
question and not what physicists normally talk about when they discuss multiple observable
universes, or "multi-verses." So let's cut to the chase: in physics, the
word "Multiverse" normally refers to one of three distinct and largely unrelated proposed
physical models for the universe - none of which has been tested or confirmed by experiment,
by the way. The three "multiverse" models are: Type 1) Bubble universes or baby black hole
universes. This is the most straightforward kind of multiverse:
the basic idea is that perhaps there are other parts of the universe which are so far away
that we will never see them (or are inside black holes so similarly we will never see
them). This kind of model was created as an attempt
to explain why our universe is so good at making stars and galaxies and black holes
and life - as the argument goes, if each of these separate mutually un-seeable "bubbles"
in the universe had slightly different laws of physics, then by definition we could only
exist in one that had the right physical laws to allow us to exist. If you're not convinced by this logic, don't
worry too much: there's not yet any experimental evidence for this kind of multiverse. Multiverse type 2) Membranes and extra dimensions. Inspired in part by the inability of the mathematics
of string theory to predict the right number of dimensions for the universe in which we
live, string theorists proposed the idea that perhaps what we think of as our universe is
actually just a three-dimensional surface embedded within a larger super-universe with

**Transcript**:
On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser
flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than 
five decades in the making. The power grids 
of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine
stretching coast to coast. Today, the US power grid is the
world's largest machine. It contains more than 7,300 
electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of 
powerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth’s continents,
transmitting electricity around the clock. They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends
on a delicate balance. Their components must always
work in unison, maintain a constant frequency
throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there's too much electricity
in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can
overheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity 
and you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid
from sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand 
and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output 
up or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the 
availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy
sources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy 
from the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are
ordered by price. Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower
production costs. Some grids, like those 
in Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy. But most dispatch curves contain
more of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting
energy sources. This means that where your electricity
is coming from— and how clean it is— 
varies throughout the day— as often as every few minutes. Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting 
power plants. This is because wind energy is especially
plentiful at night. But, this is also when 
there’s lower demand. So, Kansas’s wind energy 
is actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity 
from damaging the grid. And comparable scenarios
add up to a big problem worldwide. Thankfully, dependence on renewables
is rising. But power grids are often unable
to make full use of them. Many simply weren't designed around
intermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts
of electricity. Researchers are experimenting 
with unique storage solutions. However, this will take time
and substantial investment. But hope is not lost. We have the opportunity to work with
our existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean 
electricity to spare. Leaning into this concept,
called “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid
and reduce the need for non-renewables. So researchers are developing 
automated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity 
from the grid at the cleanest times. In fact, smart devices 
like this already exist. So, how big an effect could they have? If smart technologies like
air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were 
implemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could 
decrease by around 20%. In other words, simply coordinating
when certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons 
of carbon released into the atmosphere 
annually from Texas alone. Now, imagine what this could look
like on a global scale.

**Transcript**:
On February 7th, 1967, Homer Loutzenheuser
flipped a switch in Nebraska and realized a dream more than 
five decades in the making. The power grids 
of the United States joined together, forming one interconnected machine
stretching coast to coast. Today, the US power grid is the
world's largest machine. It contains more than 7,300 
electricity-generating plants, linked by some 11 million kilometers of 
powerlines, transformers and substations. Power grids span Earth’s continents,
transmitting electricity around the clock. They’re massive feats of engineering— but their functioning depends
on a delicate balance. Their components must always
work in unison, maintain a constant frequency
throughout the grid, and match energy supply with demand. If there's too much electricity
in the system, you get unsafe power spikes that can
overheat and damage equipment. Too little electricity 
and you get blackouts. So, to strike this balance, power grid operators monitor the grid
from sophisticated control centers. They forecast energy demand 
and adjust which power plants are active, signaling them to turn their output 
up or down to precisely meet current demand. By considering factors like the 
availability and cost of energy resources, grid operators create a “dispatch curve,” which maps out the order in which energy
sources will be used. The grid defaults to using energy 
from the start of the curve first. Usually, the resources are
ordered by price. Those at the start tend to be renewables because they have much lower
production costs. Some grids, like those 
in Iceland and Costa Rica, run on more than 98% clean energy. But most dispatch curves contain
more of a mix of carbon-free and carbon-emitting
energy sources. This means that where your electricity
is coming from— and how clean it is— 
varies throughout the day— as often as every few minutes. Take the state of Kansas. Despite having plentiful wind resources, it regularly relies on carbon-emitting 
power plants. This is because wind energy is especially
plentiful at night. But, this is also when 
there’s lower demand. So, Kansas’s wind energy 
is actually regularly disposed of to prevent excess electricity 
from damaging the grid. And comparable scenarios
add up to a big problem worldwide. Thankfully, dependence on renewables
is rising. But power grids are often unable
to make full use of them. Many simply weren't designed around
intermittent energy sources and can't store large amounts
of electricity. Researchers are experimenting 
with unique storage solutions. However, this will take time
and substantial investment. But hope is not lost. We have the opportunity to work with
our existing power grids in a new way: by shifting some of our energy use to the times when there’s clean 
electricity to spare. Leaning into this concept,
called “load flexibility,” we can help flatten the peaks in demand, which will place less stress on the grid
and reduce the need for non-renewables. So researchers are developing 
automated emissions reduction technologies that tap into energy use data and ensure that devices get electricity 
from the grid at the cleanest times. In fact, smart devices 
like this already exist. So, how big an effect could they have? If smart technologies like
air conditioners, water heaters, and electric vehicle chargers were 
implemented across the Texas power grid, the state’s emissions could 
decrease by around 20%. In other words, simply coordinating
when certain devices tap into the grid could translate to 6 million fewer tons 
of carbon released into the atmosphere 
annually from Texas alone. Now, imagine what this could look
like on a global scale.

**Transcript**:
Shielded from the gorgon’s 
stone-cold gaze, Perseus crept through Medusa’s cave. When he reached her, 
he took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, 
a giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,
white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him
on Mount Olympus. Bellerophon believed that Pegasus would be
key in helping him reach such heights. One night, 
he visited the temple of Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and prayed for the power 
to appease the mighty animal. When Bellerophon woke, 
he found a magical golden bridle, and sped to the fountain 
that Pegasus drank from. As soon as the horse bent
towards the water, Bellerophon jumped on his back
and slipped the bridle on. Finally, Pegasus was subdued. With this conquest, Bellerophon felt
that he was on his way to becoming a legendary hero. He trained for battle day and night. But one training session
went horribly wrong, and Bellerophon mortally injured 
his brother, Deliades. Disgraced, he was exiled to Argos, 
where King Proetus purified him. Bellerophon was resolved 
to repair his reputation, but the Queen of Argos had her eye on him. And when Bellerophon rebuffed
her advances, she accused him of trying to seduce her,
further tarnishing his honor. King Proetus soon devised
a plan to exact revenge. He banished Bellerophon and Pegasus 
and sent them to the kingdom of Lycia, carrying a note to Iobates, Lycia’s king. But unbeknownst to Bellerophon, he was
carrying a decree for his own death. Iobates considered how to dispose
of the youth and picked just the right monster
for the job: the fire-breathing lion-goat-dragon 
Chimera that had long been
terrorizing his kingdom. Bellerophon— eager to achieve greatness—
jumped at the challenge. He mounted Pegasus,
and the two shot into the sky. Swooping above the earth, they saw the 
Chimera surrounded by its charred victims. Soon, they too were facing its firepower. In a sequence of agile aerial acrobatics, Pegasus dodged every blast
from the Chimera as Bellerophon launched his arrows. Finally, Pegasus closed in on the beast
at just the right angle, and Bellerophon dealt it a deadly blow. Iobates was incredulous. He was glad to be rid of the monster, 
but still needed to deal with Bellerophon. So, he set forth more challenges, putting Bellerophon up against 
fearsome warriors, highly skilled archers, and, ultimately,
Lycia’s best soldiers. Every time, Pegasus’ power turned the tide
in Bellerophon’s favor. Finally, Iobates had no choice 
but to  concede that Bellerophon was a true hero. He even offered him 
his daughter’s hand in marriage. But Bellerophon’s sights were set far
beyond the land of mortals. He was certain he must now be entitled
to a place on Mount Olympus. So, he jumped onto Pegasus 
and urged him higher and higher. Zeus watched as Bellerophon,
buoyed by hubris, neared his palace. To punish the youth, 
he released a single gadfly, which beelined towards Pegasus 
and bit into his flesh. This was as high 
as Bellerophon would ever get. As Pegasus flinched, 
he flung his rider into the air, and Bellerophon fell careening
back to Earth. Pegasus, on the other hand, 
ascended with Zeus’s blessing. The gods welcomed him into the halls 
of Mount Olympus and immortalized him in a constellation. There in the night sky, 
Pegasus can be seen soaring, unfettered and free.

Shielded from the gorgon’s 
stone-cold gaze, Perseus crept through Medusa’s cave. When he reached her, 
he took a deep breath, and in one sudden movement, drew his sickle 
and brought it down on her neck. Medusa’s head rolled to the ground 
and from her neck sprung two children. One of them was Chrysaor, 
a giant wielding a golden sword; The other was the magnificent,
white, winged horse, Pegasus. He was swifter than any other steed,
and with the stomp of his hooves, he could alter mountains 
and draw streams from dry rock. No bridle could contain him—
until one fateful day. Bellerophon, prince
of the Greek city-state of Corinth, seemed to have it all. But his ambitions
exceeded his earthly circumstances. What he truly wanted was 
to be a hero so great that the gods would welcome him

**Transcript**:
Today is the one year anniversary 
of the best-worst day of your life. The best part was discovering
a subterranean city on Mars: the first evidence of intelligent 
alien life ever found. The worst part? No one got to explore it, because that was when you lost contact
with Earth. You and the other 99 scientists
have spent the rest of the year engineering your survival, but you’re almost out of water 
and solutions. Everyone else is at the ice cap, but you’ve decided to investigate
the buried city to see if there are clues to how their
civilization survived on a desert planet. The city is mostly ruins 
except for three intact pyramids— two open and one sealed. In the first you find a series 
of symbols and pictograms, revealing a fortuitously 
base 10 numbering system. The second pyramid’s facade 
is covered in these symbols. Inside you discover a device, as well as mosaic representations
of how to use it. From those you glean the following: the device is the key to opening 
the sealed pyramid by inputting the number 
on the center block. But if you put in the wrong number,
something terrible and deadly will happen. The doors to all pyramids work
on the same principle. What number should you input to open
the door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second
pyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers
directly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,
40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7
and an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined
by trial and error, but it’s quicker to use
algebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center
number is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, 
is equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, 
making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the pyramid rule that governs the numbers on the pyramid?
Options: A. Any number can be written anywhere., B. Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly beneath it., C. Each number is the product of the two numbers directly beneath it., D. Each number is the same as another number in the same pyramid.
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the pattern revealed by the second pyramid's facade?

and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Today is the one year anniversary 
of the best-worst day of your life. The best part was discovering
a subterranean city on Mars: the first evidence of intelligent 
alien life ever found. The worst part? No one got to explore it, because that was when you lost contact
with Earth. You and the other 99 scientists
have spent the rest of the year engineering your survival, but you’re almost out of water 
and solutions. Everyone else is at the ice cap, but you’ve decided to investigate
the buried city to see if there are clues to how their
civilization survived on a desert planet. The city is mostly ruins 
except for three intact pyramids— two open and one sealed. In the first you find a series 
of symbols and pictograms, revealing a fortuitously 
base 10 numbering system. The second pyramid’s facade 
is covered in these symbols. Inside you discover a device, as well as mosaic representations
of how to use it. From those you glean the following: the device is the key to opening 
the sealed pyramid by inputting the number 
on the center block. But if you put in the wrong number,
something terrible and deadly will happen. The doors to all pyramids work
on the same principle. What number should you input to open
the door to the sealed pyramid? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The pattern revealed by the second
pyramid is that every number is the sum of the two numbers
directly beneath it. If that applies to the sealed pyramid,
40 clearly belongs to the left of 30. The center number is the sum of 7
and an unknown, call it x. The value of x can be determined
by trial and error, but it’s quicker to use
algebraic reasoning. The number to the left of the center
number is 5+x. Therefore, this block, 40, 
is equal to 5+x plus 7+x. Solving for x, x must be 14, 
making the central block 21. You enter 21 on the remote, 
and the door opens! Inside you find yet another riddle. The walls show the history
of this civilization. When they lived here, the planet
was covered with oceans. But at a certain point, 
they up and left Mars. In order to reserve the planet 
for themselves while making it inhospitable to others, they moved all the water underground, using a gigantic engineering marvel
activated by a single lever. The lever is hidden in the Great Pyramid. Pulling the lever again would reverse 
the process, and bring the water back to the surface. But where is this Great Pyramid? The mosaics indicate it should be 
right here, but it’s clearly not. Without it, you have no choice but to
climb back out of the city to the surface. And that’s when you see it. The city is the final pyramid,
or at least one face of it. A great pyramid, indeed! The city’s architects must have 
designed each district to show a number when viewed from above. But only these three survived
the ravages of time. The key once again must be whatever
number was in the center plaza. You rush there, but what number should
you input into the remote? Pause here to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could write out the algebra again,
but here’s a more visual approach. Sketch a pyramid,
and enter the known numbers. Between the 9 and the 10, you can put colored dots to represent
the two unknowns at the bottom. Working your way up the pyramid
and drawing the sums as you go will reveal that 100 = 19 + 3 green dots + 3 orange dots. So 3(green + orange)=81, and green + orange, 
which is the middle number, must be 27. You don’t actually have to figure
out what green and orange are— in fact, 
they have a number of possibilities. When you enter 27, a hidden mechanism 
opens in the middle of the plaza, revealing a staircase. You descend, and finally find yourself in a room 
with a giant lever in the middle. Only one question remains:
do you pull it?

if you're an astronomy Enthusiast September end will be an exciting time that's because the biggest planet in the solar system will be at its closest to Earth in the last 59 years as it reaches its opposition from the Viewpoint of Earth's surface an opposition happens when an astronomical object rises in the east as the sun sets in the west placing the object and the sun on opposite sides of Earth according to NASA Jupiter's opposition occurs every 13 months making the planet appear larger and brighter than any other time of the year but that's not all Jupiter will also make its closest approach to Earth in the last 59 years this happens because Earth and Jupiter do not orbit the Sun in perfect circles meaning the planets will pass each other at different distances throughout the year Jupiter's closest approach to Earth rarely coincides with opposition which means this year's views will be extraordinary at its closest approach Jupiter would be approximately 367 million miles or 590 million kilometers from Earth about the same distance it was in 1963. the massive planet is about 600 million miles or 965 million kilometers away from Earth at its farthest point when a superior Planet reaches its opposition it rises in the east at Sunset reaches its highest point in the sky around midnight and sets in the west at dawn so Jupiter will shine brightly throughout the night well up in the night sky Jupiter is the brightest planet in the sky after Venus as seen from the Earth since Venus is only visible in the morning or evening Skies Jupiter will be the brightest Speck of light you'll see in the night sky the gas giant has 79 confirmed moons orbiting it and four of them can be easily seen through a modest telescope or even a pair of binoculars they're known as the Galilean moons named after Galileo Galilei who first discovered them in the 17th century with good binoculars the banding of Jupiter and three to four Galilean moons should be easily visible to see Jupiter's Great Red Spot and bans in more detail a four inch or larger telescope and some filters in the green to blue range would enhance the visibility of these features in binoculars or a telescope the Galilean satellites should appear as bright dots on either side of Jupiter during opposition an ideal viewing location will be at a high elevation in a dark and dry area The View should be great for a few days before and after September 26th so it would be best if you took advantage of good weather on either side of this date to take Insight if you look around in the night sky you should be able to see Saturn the ringed planet reached its opposition about a month ago and is slightly fainted Saturn Rises before Jupiter at dusk and reaches its highest point in the southern sky around midnight it's fairly bright and can be easily seen with the naked eye a telescopic view can reveal the beautiful rings of the planet as far as other planets concerned Mercury and Venus are still emerging from behind the Sun as a result they will remain hidden in its glare for the next few days Mars Rises around an hour before midnight and can be easily seen with unaided ice the red planet will reach its opposition on December 8 2022 hence as days pass by its distance from the earth will decrease and its apparent brightness will increase close to Mars lies Uranus at an apparent magnitude of 5.8 Neptune was at opposition on September 17th which means it's the best time of year to see the ice giant however Uranus and Neptune can only be seen through a telescope or a pair of binoculars the upcoming month is also going to be an exciting one for sky gazers October has as many as seven meteor showers in its store and the most significant one is the orionid meteor shower which Peaks around October 22nd besides that observers in parts of Africa Asia Europe and Greenland can witness a partial solar eclipse we'll cover the details in our monthly video of astronomical events if you enjoyed this video make sure to like it subscribe to our Channel and press the Bell icon so you don't miss any future astronomical events

**Transcript**:
There's a grocery store
in Brooklyn, New York, with sales per square foot 4 times 
as high as any other grocery store in the area. 10,000 people work there,
and it doesn’t have a CEO. This place is the Park Slope Food Co-op, and it’s one of 3 million cooperatives,
or co-ops for short, around the world. Co-ops are a big part 
of the global economy: they employ 280 million people—
10% of the world’s workforce and the equivalent of over $2 trillion
flow through their doors every year. How is it possible that a business 
with 10,000 workers doesn’t have a CEO? To answer that, we have to talk about what
a co-op is and why they were founded. Let’s rewind to 1844. A group of 28 weavers in Rochdale, England came together to create 
and co-own a store. By buying in bulk directly from suppliers,
they could negotiate prices, which allowed all of them to buy stuff
they couldn't otherwise afford. They ran the store collectively
and democratically, which was remarkable at the time. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers
wasn't the world's first co-op, but it was the first to publicize 
its principles— principles that guide co-ops to this day. Today, there are all kinds of co-ops: REI in the US and S-Group in Finland
are large consumer co-ops. Credit unions and mutual insurance
companies are financial sector co-ops. And when farmers or other producers come
together, that's a producer co-op. And then there are worker co-ops, like Mondragon in Spain or 
The Cheeseboard in Berkeley, California, which are founded to provide jobs
to people in the community. Some consumer co-ops, like Park Slope, require their members to work shifts 
in the store. In exchange for their work, members pay 
15 to 50% less for groceries, and they influence what products
are— or aren’t— sold there. Three crucial things to know about co-ops: first, all co-ops are jointly
owned by their members, whether those members are consumers,
producers, workers, or whoever. Unlike traditional companies, 
which can have outside shareholders, all owners of a co-op are also members. Second, co-ops are not founded
to maximize profit. Many do turn a significant profit, 
but that’s not their core mission. So evaluating a co-op purely 
by traditional business metrics ignores the most important reason
for their existence: how well do they serve their members? And third: co-ops are controlled
democratically by their members. But how do decisions get made? It varies. At a small worker co-op
like The Cheeseboard, day-to-day operational decisions
are just made by the workers. As co-ops get larger, they do institute
some form of leadership or management. Park Slope has a general manager 
who leads the 80 or so employees. And the largest network of worker 
and consumer co-ops in the world, Mondragon, has a president 
and managers who lead the roughly 30,000 worker-owners 
and 50,000 contract workers. But leadership roles in a co-op are very
different than in a traditional company. The leadership implements policies
that its members or worker-owners have agreed upon, by vote. And at Mondragon workers, 
can vote to fire the president. At a co-op, there’s no single person with overarching, top-down power 
over everyone else, like a CEO would have 
in a traditional company. Meanwhile, in both co-ops 
and traditional companies, major company-wide decisions
are made by voting. But who votes and how is wildly different. In a traditional company, voting rights 
usually come with shares of stock. The more shares you own, 
the more votes you have. Take Alphabet, 
the parent company of Google: there are thousands of shareholders, but the two founders control 51% 
of the votes and therefore the direction 
of the company. In a co-op, every member 
has the right to vote, and in most co-ops,
every member gets one vote. That difference results 
in radically different policies than you’d find at traditional companies. For example, Mondragon limits the salaries
of its management to about 6 times what the lowest paid 
worker makes. In Spain, CEOs of traditional companies 
make, on average, 143 times as much as a typical worker. At Park Slope, there’s a monthly 
general meeting, where any member can show up to vote, and a motion needs a
simple majority to pass. It then gets taken up by
the Board of directors, which is composed of co-op members,
for official approval. At The Cheeseboard, the worker-owners 
try to reach consensus on major decisions. This means that some decisions
can take a long time. For example, in the late 1970s, the workers debated whether to post
a sign outside declaring that The Cheeseboard was a collective
for one and a half years. But the extensive discussion, 
and disagreements, around that decision made it a solid one— The Cheeseboard still advertises
the fact that it’s a collective almost 50 years later. And that’s not all that’s
working well at co-ops. Studies in the UK show that co-op
start-ups are almost half as likely to close within five years
as traditional businesses. And in one study, 
researchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other
was a traditional company. The workers did similar work 
with similar salaries. The biggest difference? Co-op workers were 
about 40% happier with their jobs.

**Transcript**:
There's a grocery store
in Brooklyn, New York, with sales per square foot 4 times 
as high as any other grocery store in the area. 10,000 people work there,
and it doesn’t have a CEO. This place is the Park Slope Food Co-op, and it’s one of 3 million cooperatives,
or co-ops for short, around the world. Co-ops are a big part 
of the global economy: they employ 280 million people—
10% of the world’s workforce and the equivalent of over $2 trillion
flow through their doors every year. How is it possible that a business 
with 10,000 workers doesn’t have a CEO? To answer that, we have to talk about what
a co-op is and why they were founded. Let’s rewind to 1844. A group of 28 weavers in Rochdale, England came together to create 
and co-own a store. By buying in bulk directly from suppliers,
they could negotiate prices, which allowed all of them to buy stuff
they couldn't otherwise afford. They ran the store collectively
and democratically, which was remarkable at the time. The Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers
wasn't the world's first co-op, but it was the first to publicize 
its principles— principles that guide co-ops to this day. Today, there are all kinds of co-ops: REI in the US and S-Group in Finland
are large consumer co-ops. Credit unions and mutual insurance
companies are financial sector co-ops. And when farmers or other producers come
together, that's a producer co-op. And then there are worker co-ops, like Mondragon in Spain or 
The Cheeseboard in Berkeley, California, which are founded to provide jobs
to people in the community. Some consumer co-ops, like Park Slope, require their members to work shifts 
in the store. In exchange for their work, members pay 
15 to 50% less for groceries, and they influence what products
are— or aren’t— sold there. Three crucial things to know about co-ops: first, all co-ops are jointly
owned by their members, whether those members are consumers,
producers, workers, or whoever. Unlike traditional companies, 
which can have outside shareholders, all owners of a co-op are also members. Second, co-ops are not founded
to maximize profit. Many do turn a significant profit, 
but that’s not their core mission. So evaluating a co-op purely 
by traditional business metrics ignores the most important reason
for their existence: how well do they serve their members? And third: co-ops are controlled
democratically by their members. But how do decisions get made? It varies. At a small worker co-op
like The Cheeseboard, day-to-day operational decisions
are just made by the workers. As co-ops get larger, they do institute
some form of leadership or management. Park Slope has a general manager 
who leads the 80 or so employees. And the largest network of worker 
and consumer co-ops in the world, Mondragon, has a president 
and managers who lead the roughly 30,000 worker-owners 
and 50,000 contract workers. But leadership roles in a co-op are very
different than in a traditional company. The leadership implements policies
that its members or worker-owners have agreed upon, by vote. And at Mondragon workers, 
can vote to fire the president. At a co-op, there’s no single person with overarching, top-down power 
over everyone else, like a CEO would have 
in a traditional company. Meanwhile, in both co-ops 
and traditional companies, major company-wide decisions
are made by voting. But who votes and how is wildly different. In a traditional company, voting rights 
usually come with shares of stock. The more shares you own, 
the more votes you have. Take Alphabet, 
the parent company of Google: there are thousands of shareholders, but the two founders control 51% 
of the votes and therefore the direction 
of the company. In a co-op, every member 
has the right to vote, and in most co-ops,
every member gets one vote. That difference results 
in radically different policies than you’d find at traditional companies. For example, Mondragon limits the salaries
of its management to about 6 times what the lowest paid 
worker makes. In Spain, CEOs of traditional companies 
make, on average, 143 times as much as a typical worker. At Park Slope, there’s a monthly 
general meeting, where any member can show up to vote, and a motion needs a
simple majority to pass. It then gets taken up by
the Board of directors, which is composed of co-op members,
for official approval. At The Cheeseboard, the worker-owners 
try to reach consensus on major decisions. This means that some decisions
can take a long time. For example, in the late 1970s, the workers debated whether to post
a sign outside declaring that The Cheeseboard was a collective
for one and a half years. But the extensive discussion, 
and disagreements, around that decision made it a solid one— The Cheeseboard still advertises
the fact that it’s a collective almost 50 years later. And that’s not all that’s
working well at co-ops. Studies in the UK show that co-op
start-ups are almost half as likely to close within five years
as traditional businesses. And in one study, 
researchers polled 600 workers at two in-home healthcare businesses: one was a worker co-op and the other
was a traditional company. The workers did similar work 
with similar salaries. The biggest difference? Co-op workers were 
about 40% happier with their jobs.

**Transcript**:
Pixar...the studio behind this,
and this, and this has mastered a sort of
photo-surrealistic style where there’s a sense of cartoony-ness but most things look and feel like they
could exist in the real world. Like these fibers on Mr. Incredible’s shirt. And this tree stump and grass from
this scene from Up. Or the glimmering, out-of-focus bokeh
behind Bo Peep. And it’s not just Pixar. These movies look so similar you can barely tell they’re from
different animation studios. But when you look at these movies it’s clear that something different
is happening. These lights don’t just illuminate;
they reveal a texture. This tree in the background 
isn’t out of focus it’s just got a simplified look. And this hair looks more like
brush strokes than human hair. These films are part of a new trend that’s steering animation away from 
replicating the real world and into somewhere new. Crafting beautiful animation in CG films requires a lot of dedicated artists
to perform specialized tasks: like rendering. Rendering is the process by which
a computer takes geometry, textures, lighting, camera inputs 
and does a bunch of math to apply all that information into
a final image. Like this one. Most render engines, like the one I’m using
here, are physically based which essentially means that it tries to replicate the real world physics
of light, shadow, reflection, and more. You can see this type of rendering
all over Pixar’s work even going back to their first movie. Rex looks like he could exist 
in the real world. Every meeting we would have, everybody
brought up like the Pixar look. The Pixar look was something that was very
high quality very successful at the box office so everybody kind of wanted the Pixar look. My name is Christos Obrenetov. Christos is the CEO of Lollipop Shaders a company that builds custom shaders
and plugins for 3D software. He’s worked on tons of films including "Life of Pi", "A Christmas Carol,"
and the upcoming "Across the Spider-Verse". But before all that he worked on a bunch of films that tried to
replicate that Pixar look. Because it was reliable, popular, and safe. Part of doing a feature film is, you know,
a lot of money and a lot of time. So they were kind of chasing that Pixar dream
of having that kind of a success. So to go and spend, you know, $100 million
or more... the investors and what not
are probably saying: "It's got to look like Pixar or Disney."
Right? And that was the case for a long time. Even when studios wanted to try
something different: Disney would come up and interview for a movie
that ended up being called "Bolt". They were showing us this really cool concept
art and they're like, "Oh, it's going to be super stylized." "It's going to look like sort of like 
the concept art." And it was very exciting. I was like, "Oh, this is great." And then when the movie 
did come out I mean, Bolt is fantastic, but they made it
very, you know, that same look. Movies like "Monster House" and "A Christmas
Carol" were intended to look stylized too but ultimately they settled back into
that tried-and-true physically based rendering look. There were glimmers of more stylized approaches
in short film tests and small sequences like in Disney’s Moana. But this stylized sequence
is only about 30 seconds out of the hour and 43 minute-long film. A lot of studios have been playing with
this for a long time. But to take that risk to do a full feature film that's
very stylized in 3D I think people were scared. And that fear kept studios from making
bold choices. Until 2017 when the trailer for
"Into the Spider-Verse" dropped. It had simplified graphic bursts that felt
like comic book panels. There was no motion blur or depth of field and everything, from the characters to the
environments, was full of texture. According to one of the animation supervisors
for the project after a year and a half of work the studio was still nervous that people were
going to hate the visuals. Because they felt like they were taking too
many risks. Instead of leaning into the safe, physically
based, rendering look "Into the Spider-Verse" chose to use 
non-photorealistic rendering. To pull this off, they essentially had to
break their physically-based renderer. Instead of inputting data from lights, 
camera, and materials and receiving a realistic looking render they combined all that data with custom
data passes that tweaked things like the focus plane or the way the light worked
in an image. This combo allowed the renderer 
to produce stylized results. For example, in "Into the Spider-verse",
out of focus elements aren’t blurry. Instead, the colors split as if the screen printing on an actual 
comic book was done poorly. Lighting and shadow were approached
in new ways too. Light often reveals halftone dots. And shadows create sketchy hatch marks. But there’s more than just shading magic
happening here. Non-photorealistic renderings often use linework 2D elements like speed lines and doubles and variable frame rates to pull these frames
further away from reality and often, closer to the concept art. Just two months after its release "Into the Spider-Verse" became the highest grossing
film Sony Pictures animation had ever made. It doesn’t hold a candle to Pixar
in terms of lifetime gross: "Incredibles 2" sits at the number one spot while Spider-verse doesn’t even crack
the top 50. But, much like Pixar did in the first wave
of CG animated features "Into the Spider-Verse" redefined
the visual goals for animation studios. 2021’s "The Mitchells vs the Machines" and
2022’s "Puss in Boots" take non-photorealistic rendering in a different,
more painterly direction where out-of-focus objects 
become simplified shapes emulating the way that artists may use 
simplified marks in backgrounds "In the Mitchells vs the Machines", shadows
create different marker textures. Puss in Boots’ simplified 2D cutaways mimic
the graphic bursts of Into the Spider-verse. People were like, "Oh, this is looks really
good and it's different". So now, all future projects at studios from
DreamWorks and Imageworks and Pixar— they're looking at the next whatever, five
years or whatnot. It's all like very stylized. And that’s really exciting because non-photorealism allows animated movies
to take advantage of the things that make them special. They can be anything the imagination allows.

of having that kind of a success. So to go and spend, you know, $100 million
or more... the investors and what not
are probably saying: "It's got to look like Pixar or Disney."
Right? And that was the case for a long time. Even when studios wanted to try
something different: Disney would come up and interview for a movie
that ended up being called "Bolt". They were showing us this really cool concept
art and they're like, "Oh, it's going to be super stylized." "It's going to look like sort of like 
the concept art." And it was very exciting. I was like, "Oh, this is great." And then when the movie 
did come out I mean, Bolt is fantastic, but they made it
very, you know, that same look. Movies like "Monster House" and "A Christmas
Carol" were intended to look stylized too but ultimately they settled back into
that tried-and-true physically based rendering look. There were glimmers of more stylized approaches
in short film tests and small sequences like in Disney’s Moana. But this stylized sequence
is only about 30 seconds out of the hour and 43 minute-long film. A lot of studios have been playing with
this for a long time. But to take that risk to do a full feature film that's
very stylized in 3D I think people were scared. And that fear kept studios from making
bold choices. Until 2017 when the trailer for
"Into the Spider-Verse" dropped. It had simplified graphic bursts that felt
like comic book panels. There was no motion blur or depth of field and everything, from the characters to the
environments, was full of texture. According to one of the animation supervisors
for the project after a year and a half of work the studio was still nervous that people were
going to hate the visuals. Because they felt like they were taking too
many risks. Instead of leaning into the safe, physically
based, rendering look "Into the Spider-Verse" chose to use 
non-photorealistic rendering. To pull this off, they essentially had to
break their physically-based renderer. Instead of inputting data from lights, 
camera, and materials and receiving a realistic looking render they combined all that data with custom
data passes that tweaked things like the focus plane or the way the light worked
in an image. This combo allowed the renderer 
to produce stylized results. For example, in "Into the Spider-verse",
out of focus elements aren’t blurry. Instead, the colors split as if the screen printing on an actual 
comic book was done poorly. Lighting and shadow were approached
in new ways too. Light often reveals halftone dots. And shadows create sketchy hatch marks. But there’s more than just shading magic
happening here. Non-photorealistic renderings often use linework 2D elements like speed lines and doubles and variable frame rates to pull these frames
further away from reality and often, closer to the concept art. Just two months after its release "Into the Spider-Verse" became the highest grossing
film Sony Pictures animation had ever made. It doesn’t hold a candle to Pixar
in terms of lifetime gross: "Incredibles 2" sits at the number one spot while Spider-verse doesn’t even crack
the top 50. But, much like Pixar did in the first wave
of CG animated features "Into the Spider-Verse" redefined
the visual goals for animation studios. 2021’s "The Mitchells vs the Machines" and
2022’s "Puss in Boots" take non-photorealistic rendering in a different,
more painterly direction where out-of-focus objects 
become simplified shapes emulating the way that artists may use 
simplified marks in backgrounds "In the Mitchells vs the Machines", shadows
create different marker textures. Puss in Boots’ simplified 2D cutaways mimic
the graphic bursts of Into the Spider-verse. People were like, "Oh, this is looks really
good and it's different". So now, all future projects at studios from
DreamWorks and Imageworks and Pixar— they're looking at the next whatever, five
years or whatnot. It's all like very stylized. And that’s really exciting because non-photorealism allows animated movies
to take advantage of the things that make them special. They can be anything the imagination allows.

**Transcript**:
Pixar...the studio behind this,
and this, and this has mastered a sort of
photo-surrealistic style where there’s a sense of cartoony-ness but most things look and feel like they
could exist in the real world. Like these fibers on Mr. Incredible’s shirt. And this tree stump and grass from
this scene from Up. Or the glimmering, out-of-focus bokeh
behind Bo Peep. And it’s not just Pixar. These movies look so similar you can barely tell they’re from
different animation studios. But when you look at these movies it’s clear that something different
is happening. These lights don’t just illuminate;
they reveal a texture. This tree in the background 
isn’t out of focus it’s just got a simplified look. And this hair looks more like
brush strokes than human hair. These films are part of a new trend that’s steering animation away from 
replicating the real world and into somewhere new. Crafting beautiful animation in CG films requires a lot of dedicated artists
to perform specialized tasks: like rendering. Rendering is the process by which
a computer takes geometry, textures, lighting, camera inputs 
and does a bunch of math to apply all that information into
a final image. Like this one. Most render engines, like the one I’m using
here, are physically based which essentially means that it tries to replicate the real world physics
of light, shadow, reflection, and more. You can see this type of rendering
all over Pixar’s work even going back to their first movie. Rex looks like he could exist 
in the real world. Every meeting we would have, everybody
brought up like the Pixar look. The Pixar look was something that was very
high quality very successful at the box office so everybody kind of wanted the Pixar look. My name is Christos Obrenetov. Christos is the CEO of Lollipop Shaders a company that builds custom shaders
and plugins for 3D software. He’s worked on tons of films including "Life of Pi", "A Christmas Carol,"
and the upcoming "Across the Spider-Verse". But before all that he worked on a bunch of films that tried to
replicate that Pixar look. Because it was reliable, popular, and safe. Part of doing a feature film is, you know,
a lot of money and a lot of time. So they were kind of chasing that Pixar dream

**Transcript**:
On a daily basis, you spend
between a third and half your waking hours daydreaming. That may sound like a huge waste of time, but scientists think it must have 
some purpose, or humans wouldn’t have evolved
to do so much of it. So to figure out what's going on here, let’s take a closer look 
at the mind-wanderer in chief: the bored teenager. Wouldn’t it be cool to discover something,
anything. Like even this plant. Just to be one of those explorers who 
sails around drawing stuff for years on end 
and everyone thinks they’re a genius. But does anyone even do that anymore? Is there anything left to discover? And would I be tough enough to deal 
with the dysentery or scurvy or piranhas or whatever? I barely have the endurance
to make it through track practice... but I will. Any day now, I’ll have the
discipline to show up before sunrise and practice. I’ll win all my races. Winning will become so easy,
I’ll pick up other events just for fun. And once I'm in the Olympics, they’ll have no choice 
but to crown me team captain, which I will graciously accept. And will I be nasty to the teammate
who yelled at me? No. I’ll just calmly say, 
“hope you’re in a better mood.” Okay. Yours and other people's daydreams
might sound or feel something like that. Let's see what was going on. To see what parts of the brain are active when you’re doing a task, or thinking,
or daydreaming, scientists use brain imaging techniques 
that show increased blood flow and energy 
expenditure in those areas. These brain areas are active, working together and communicating
with each other. Taken together, they're called
the executive network. When your mind starts to wander, a different set of brain areas
becomes active. These areas make up the
default mode network. The name default mode makes it sound
like nothing is going on. And in fact, for many years, scientists associated this pattern
of activity with rest. But a closer look reveals that these
are the brain areas involved when we revisit a memory, when we think
about our plans and hopes, and yes, when our minds are wandering
off on a wild daydream. The mind can wander to unproductive
or distressing places and brood over negative past events,
like an argument. It can also wander to neutral,
everyday matters, like planning out the rest
of one's afternoon. But where mind-wandering 
really gets interesting is when it crosses into the realm 
of free-moving associative thought that you aren’t consciously directing. This kind of mind-wandering is associated 
with increases in both ideas and positive emotions, and the evidence suggests that daydreaming
can help people envision ways to reach their goals and navigate
relationships and social situations. Scientists think there may be 
two essential parts to this process: a generative phase of free-flowing ideas
and spontaneous thoughts, courtesy of the default mode network, followed by a process of selecting, 
developing, and pursuing the best ideas from that generative burst, driven by logical thinking 
thanks to the executive network. A host of imaging studies suggest that
these two networks working in sync is a crucial condition 
for creative thinking. Taken together, the evidence clearly
suggests the logical realm of the executive network and the imaginative realm 
of the default mode network are closely related. And as you can see, the executive network
is still playing a role when the default mode network is
doing its thing during daydreaming. In teenagers, the prefrontal cortex and other areas
involved in executive function are still developing, but teens are perfectly capable of 
thinking through their problems and goals, especially when given space to do so
on their own.

“hope you’re in a better mood.” Okay. Yours and other people's daydreams
might sound or feel something like that. Let's see what was going on. To see what parts of the brain are active when you’re doing a task, or thinking,
or daydreaming, scientists use brain imaging techniques 
that show increased blood flow and energy 
expenditure in those areas. These brain areas are active, working together and communicating
with each other. Taken together, they're called
the executive network. When your mind starts to wander, a different set of brain areas
becomes active. These areas make up the
default mode network. The name default mode makes it sound
like nothing is going on. And in fact, for many years, scientists associated this pattern
of activity with rest. But a closer look reveals that these
are the brain areas involved when we revisit a memory, when we think
about our plans and hopes, and yes, when our minds are wandering
off on a wild daydream. The mind can wander to unproductive
or distressing places and brood over negative past events,
like an argument. It can also wander to neutral,
everyday matters, like planning out the rest
of one's afternoon. But where mind-wandering 
really gets interesting is when it crosses into the realm 
of free-moving associative thought that you aren’t consciously directing. This kind of mind-wandering is associated 
with increases in both ideas and positive emotions, and the evidence suggests that daydreaming
can help people envision ways to reach their goals and navigate
relationships and social situations. Scientists think there may be 
two essential parts to this process: a generative phase of free-flowing ideas
and spontaneous thoughts, courtesy of the default mode network, followed by a process of selecting, 
developing, and pursuing the best ideas from that generative burst, driven by logical thinking 
thanks to the executive network. A host of imaging studies suggest that
these two networks working in sync is a crucial condition 
for creative thinking. Taken together, the evidence clearly
suggests the logical realm of the executive network and the imaginative realm 
of the default mode network are closely related. And as you can see, the executive network
is still playing a role when the default mode network is
doing its thing during daydreaming. In teenagers, the prefrontal cortex and other areas
involved in executive function are still developing, but teens are perfectly capable of 
thinking through their problems and goals, especially when given space to do so
on their own.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When I was six, my father told me that I was made
out of tiny cells filled with chromosomes that would control my fate. I thought, "That's amazing. There are so many mysterious things
in there, and I want to know more.” I read about Galileo and Darwin,
and I became a scientist. At that time, hardly anything was known. We did not yet know that the chemical
elements came from exploded stars, that everything you see around you
was recycled from inside of stars. So we did not know we are recycled stars. But we set off to measure the Big Bang, and we measured the map of the cosmic
microwave background radiation, using millimeter waves and it's the entire sky
wrapped around on to an oval so you can see it. We see that there are hot and cold
spots in this Big Bang material. Now we say, well, that’s because those
were there in very, very beginning, who knows exactly why, but they led to the existence of galaxies,
stars, planets and, eventually, people. No spots, no people. So it turned out to be important. So then how did that work? What happened next? Well, we said let's take pictures. So, of course, we take pictures of the
sky with the Hubble Space Telescope. This picture was taken around 1995, and it shows galaxies far, far, far away. It shows what you can get with the telescope
that's about eight feet in diameter and can observe visible light. So we were thrilled to have this picture. And it shows thousands of galaxies. They were unable to include
the most distant galaxies, the ones that would be
as they were being born, so there are no baby pictures
of galaxies in this picture. We needed to have an even bigger
and more powerful telescope that could pick up the infrared light
from the most distant universe that has been stretched out
by the expansion of the universe. So we didn't know what we would find. So astronomers wrote a book and they said, "Please build us an even more
powerful telescope." And we did. This is the James Webb Space Telescope,
you see a gigantic mirror, it's hexagonal, it's coated with gold
so it reflects infrared light. It is 21 feet across. It is protected by a five-layer
metalized plastic sunshade as large as a tennis court. This telescope is so large
that it could not fit into the rocket without being folded up like origami. It's an incredible engineering
accomplishment to be able to even conceive
and build this telescope. So we built it. And then we've launched it. It went up into space from French Guiana
on Christmas morning, 2021. It was a perfect launch. The Arianespace company sent it
straight to where we needed to go. So we think we can have 20 years
of operational scientific observations with this great new telescope. And it took only two minutes
to go through the tropical clouds up towards the vacuum of outer space. Now I want to show you
how it unfolded in outer space, this origami telescope. First we unfolded the solar panels. Then we unfold the transmitter antenna so we can talk back and forth. Then we unfold the panels
that hold the great sunshade in place. This takes us actually
two weeks in real life. You see it compressed here
so we can show it to you. This is just a miracle of modern
engineering, and it’s so complicated. And you'd say, is there any way
you could have done this without this great telescope? And the answer seems to be no. You need a big telescope. It needs to be in outer space. It needs to be cold, so it doesn’t glow
and emit its own infrared. And third is, being very carefully
unrolled all by commands from here. So you ask, how could you possibly
make such a complicated thing work? Well, number one, practice,
practice, practice, rehearse and test,
fix it when it's not quite right. And then, of course, have two
of everything, if you possibly can. And third, have arguments
with all of your friends to say, is this really right? Can you think of anything that's a mistake
that we might be making that we should fix before we launch it? So the last step is finally
to unfold the telescope itself. And there it is in outer space, not quite ready to use because it's still
warm and has not yet been focused. So we had to wait for several weeks
for it to start to cool down to a low enough temperature
that we could do the next steps. We send it to a place
called Lagrange Point 2, about a million miles farther out
from the Sun than we are. This is a place that moves around
the Sun with us every year, so the telescope does not
get any farther away. It is the only place that we can put
a telescope where this is the setup, and you can have the one-sided umbrella
that protects the telescope from the Sun and the Earth and the Moon. So the next thing is, what did we see? We focused the telescope
and took some pictures of the same star
we looked at with the Webb. So the fuzzy picture is the Spitzer
Space Telescope launched in 2003. The sharp picture
is the new Webb telescope. We were so thrilled that it worked. We got a nice, sharp image of the star, and we can calculate now
the sensitivity of this object, that if you were a bumblebee, a square centimeter object
hovering at the distance of the Moon from the Earth,
away from the telescope, we would be able to see you, both the sunlight you reflect
and the heat you emit. So there are no bumblebees in space, but there's something out there
that we don't know. And I'm so sure that we're going to get
a great surprise from this telescope. So I'll show you what we look at. Here is an example of a place
where stars are being born as we speak. Now we know, more or less,
that stars explode and produce dust, which goes and is recycled into new stars. This is a place where
the recycling is happening. Stars are being born in this beautiful
cloud of glowing gas and dust. On the left-hand side shows you
what we see with visible light with the Hubble Space Telescope. The right-hand side shows you
that you can begin to see through the dust with an infrared camera that we also have
on the Hubble telescope. It's beautiful. Astronomers want to see inside and we will with the Webb telescope. We can look at everything
in the solar system from Mars on out. So this is a pretty interesting one, everybody knows Mars might be alive. What about Europa? Europa is a satellite of Jupiter. It has a liquid ocean covered with ice. We know because we sent a probe
out there named after Galileo himself, and we saw this and took this picture. Now we know that there is water
coming out from the cracks between the ice blocks and once in a while,
they can be watched from here. And we are planning to send a probe
to fly through the water jets and see if there might be
any organic molecules in them. Is it alive? Well, maybe. We'll be watching this satellite
with the Webb telescope as well. Farther on out in the solar system,
we've been watching Titan. Titan is the only moon in the solar system
that has oceans and lakes and rain and rivers
and an atmosphere on the surface. It is so cold, though, that its liquid hydrocarbons,
methane and ethane, that you would use for fuel here on Earth. So we'll be examining this
with the Webb telescope and we'll be sending a probe out there to land with even a helicopter
to go exploring. So is this a place
that's interesting for life? Possibly. People ask me all the time, are we sure that the kind
we have here is the only kind? Well, maybe not. And if not, this is a good place
to look because it's different, but it still has solids,
liquids and gases, and it has a liquid hydrocarbon,
which might be a possible solvent. We'll see. Next thing we want to look at is, are there planets around other stars
that might have life? So we will be looking in this way at small stars that have
Earth-sized planets. When a planet goes in front of the star,
it can block some starlight, some of the starlight goes through
the atmosphere of the planet, if it has one, and on its way to our telescope, and we can analyze that and look for the chemistry
of such an atmosphere. So, number one, does a little
Earth-like planet out there have an atmosphere? Number two, does it have any
molecules in the atmosphere? And number three, could they be water? Is there enough water out there
so that there could be a liquid ocean? Well, maybe. We will find out and we'll tell you. So are we alone? Well, I don't know. But we'll be going on after this project to even more powerful telescopes that can examine little Earths
around stars like the Sun. And then we'll be able to say,
"Really, really, are they like home?" And maybe yes. We will be telling you
all about what we find out, beginning with our first scientific
observations this summer. So please stay tuned. Astronomers travel with the speed of light and the speed of imagination. (Applause)

was recycled from inside of stars. So we did not know we are recycled stars. But we set off to measure the Big Bang, and we measured the map of the cosmic
microwave background radiation, using millimeter waves and it's the entire sky
wrapped around on to an oval so you can see it. We see that there are hot and cold
spots in this Big Bang material. Now we say, well, that’s because those
were there in very, very beginning, who knows exactly why, but they led to the existence of galaxies,
stars, planets and, eventually, people. No spots, no people. So it turned out to be important. So then how did that work? What happened next? Well, we said let's take pictures. So, of course, we take pictures of the
sky with the Hubble Space Telescope. This picture was taken around 1995, and it shows galaxies far, far, far away. It shows what you can get with the telescope
that's about eight feet in diameter and can observe visible light. So we were thrilled to have this picture. And it shows thousands of galaxies. They were unable to include
the most distant galaxies, the ones that would be
as they were being born, so there are no baby pictures
of galaxies in this picture. We needed to have an even bigger
and more powerful telescope that could pick up the infrared light
from the most distant universe that has been stretched out
by the expansion of the universe. So we didn't know what we would find. So astronomers wrote a book and they said, "Please build us an even more
powerful telescope." And we did. This is the James Webb Space Telescope,
you see a gigantic mirror, it's hexagonal, it's coated with gold
so it reflects infrared light. It is 21 feet across. It is protected by a five-layer
metalized plastic sunshade as large as a tennis court. This telescope is so large
that it could not fit into the rocket without being folded up like origami. It's an incredible engineering
accomplishment to be able to even conceive
and build this telescope. So we built it. And then we've launched it. It went up into space from French Guiana
on Christmas morning, 2021. It was a perfect launch. The Arianespace company sent it
straight to where we needed to go. So we think we can have 20 years
of operational scientific observations with this great new telescope. And it took only two minutes
to go through the tropical clouds up towards the vacuum of outer space. Now I want to show you
how it unfolded in outer space, this origami telescope. First we unfolded the solar panels. Then we unfold the transmitter antenna so we can talk back and forth. Then we unfold the panels
that hold the great sunshade in place. This takes us actually
two weeks in real life. You see it compressed here
so we can show it to you. This is just a miracle of modern
engineering, and it’s so complicated. And you'd say, is there any way
you could have done this without this great telescope? And the answer seems to be no. You need a big telescope. It needs to be in outer space. It needs to be cold, so it doesn’t glow
and emit its own infrared. And third is, being very carefully
unrolled all by commands from here. So you ask, how could you possibly
make such a complicated thing work? Well, number one, practice,
practice, practice, rehearse and test,
fix it when it's not quite right. And then, of course, have two
of everything, if you possibly can. And third, have arguments
with all of your friends to say, is this really right? Can you think of anything that's a mistake
that we might be making that we should fix before we launch it? So the last step is finally
to unfold the telescope itself. And there it is in outer space, not quite ready to use because it's still
warm and has not yet been focused. So we had to wait for several weeks
for it to start to cool down to a low enough temperature
that we could do the next steps. We send it to a place
called Lagrange Point 2, about a million miles farther out
from the Sun than we are. This is a place that moves around
the Sun with us every year, so the telescope does not
get any farther away. It is the only place that we can put
a telescope where this is the setup, and you can have the one-sided umbrella
that protects the telescope from the Sun and the Earth and the Moon. So the next thing is, what did we see? We focused the telescope
and took some pictures of the same star
we looked at with the Webb. So the fuzzy picture is the Spitzer
Space Telescope launched in 2003. The sharp picture
is the new Webb telescope. We were so thrilled that it worked. We got a nice, sharp image of the star, and we can calculate now
the sensitivity of this object, that if you were a bumblebee, a square centimeter object
hovering at the distance of the Moon from the Earth,
away from the telescope, we would be able to see you, both the sunlight you reflect
and the heat you emit. So there are no bumblebees in space, but there's something out there
that we don't know. And I'm so sure that we're going to get
a great surprise from this telescope. So I'll show you what we look at. Here is an example of a place
where stars are being born as we speak. Now we know, more or less,
that stars explode and produce dust, which goes and is recycled into new stars. This is a place where
the recycling is happening. Stars are being born in this beautiful
cloud of glowing gas and dust. On the left-hand side shows you
what we see with visible light with the Hubble Space Telescope. The right-hand side shows you
that you can begin to see through the dust with an infrared camera that we also have
on the Hubble telescope. It's beautiful. Astronomers want to see inside and we will with the Webb telescope. We can look at everything
in the solar system from Mars on out. So this is a pretty interesting one, everybody knows Mars might be alive. What about Europa? Europa is a satellite of Jupiter. It has a liquid ocean covered with ice. We know because we sent a probe
out there named after Galileo himself, and we saw this and took this picture. Now we know that there is water
coming out from the cracks between the ice blocks and once in a while,
they can be watched from here. And we are planning to send a probe
to fly through the water jets and see if there might be
any organic molecules in them. Is it alive? Well, maybe. We'll be watching this satellite
with the Webb telescope as well. Farther on out in the solar system,
we've been watching Titan. Titan is the only moon in the solar system
that has oceans and lakes and rain and rivers
and an atmosphere on the surface. It is so cold, though, that its liquid hydrocarbons,
methane and ethane, that you would use for fuel here on Earth. So we'll be examining this
with the Webb telescope and we'll be sending a probe out there to land with even a helicopter
to go exploring. So is this a place
that's interesting for life? Possibly. People ask me all the time, are we sure that the kind
we have here is the only kind? Well, maybe not. And if not, this is a good place
to look because it's different, but it still has solids,
liquids and gases, and it has a liquid hydrocarbon,
which might be a possible solvent. We'll see. Next thing we want to look at is, are there planets around other stars
that might have life? So we will be looking in this way at small stars that have
Earth-sized planets. When a planet goes in front of the star,
it can block some starlight, some of the starlight goes through
the atmosphere of the planet, if it has one, and on its way to our telescope, and we can analyze that and look for the chemistry
of such an atmosphere. So, number one, does a little
Earth-like planet out there have an atmosphere? Number two, does it have any
molecules in the atmosphere? And number three, could they be water? Is there enough water out there
so that there could be a liquid ocean? Well, maybe. We will find out and we'll tell you. So are we alone? Well, I don't know. But we'll be going on after this project to even more powerful telescopes that can examine little Earths
around stars like the Sun. And then we'll be able to say,
"Really, really, are they like home?" And maybe yes. We will be telling you
all about what we find out, beginning with our first scientific
observations this summer. So please stay tuned. Astronomers travel with the speed of light and the speed of imagination. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Tens of thousands of conehead termites
are swarming in the Panamanian air. These 4 young hopefuls are brave— oh... I guess 3. 
Oh, wow, 2 in 1. Okay! This single determined termite 
is braving countless threats to participate in the only flight 
of her lifetime. She evades the onslaught of predators 
even as she lands, flips off her wings, secretes pheromones, and attracts a mate. The pair dash from the danger zone
into a rotting tree stump. It’s the perfect first home—
but they’re not alone. Unlike most termite species, conehead termite colonies can have
multiple queens and kings. The pair is joined by several other
termites ready to reproduce. Together, they excavate
a chamber in the stump, seal the entrance and get busy. When the resulting offspring hatch, they 
bear little resemblance to their parents; they’re smaller, wingless,
eyeless, and sterile. Some of them, the soldiers, have the species’ trademark 
conspicuously shaped heads— the function of which will
soon be revealed. They set out to scout for dead wood,
laying the pheromone trails the rest of the offspring, 
the colony’s workers, follow and reinforce 
as they retrieve food. As the termites collect and decompose 
plant debris, they return essential nutrients
to the soil, allowing more vegetation to thrive. Gradually, worker termites expand
the colony's central chamber as they groom and feed the royals
and the upcoming broods. The tiniest termites can’t yet
eat wood independently. So, the workers process it and gift it 
to the youngsters through their saliva and by basically throwing
up into their mouths. With the workers managing groceries,
construction, and child care, the royals fully commit themselves
to reproduction. The kings provide sperm
on an as-needed basis, and the queens undergo radical
transformations. Their abdomens develop efficient 
egg-laying machinery and extend dramatically. Each queen may produce hundreds
of eggs a day. Meanwhile, a worker entourage retrieves
and neatly stacks them into piles. The colony grows quickly. And once its population is big enough, workers construct a system of tunnels
stretching over 100 meters across terrain, along fallen logs,
and up into tree crowns. These tunnels shelter the termites
as they travel to and from food sites around the clock. And eventually, they build 
a distinctive central nest. Using partially digested 
plant material, soil, and poop, they construct a massive 
egg-shaped structure, complete with numerous passages,
chambers, and ventilation holes. Deep within, they establish a royal cell
that's fortified with extra thick walls. It’s not long before this architectural
marvel attracts an admirer: an anteater. She swipes at the nest 
and pokes her long tongue in. Those trapped in the tongue’s spines 
and sticky saliva are whisked off to their deaths. But the termite soldiers
launch a counterattack. They’re tiny and blind but their heads
function like squirt guns. They secure the anteater’s position
using chemical signals, clench their powerful muscles and shoot
a sticky spray from their heads. After a minute, 
the anteater stops feeding, scratches the goo away, 
and lopes off. The nest sustained some damage, 
but the royals remain undisturbed, pumping out eggs into their
reinforced fortress. As the colony matures, some of the
young develop into reproductives. Most fly off to establish new colonies—
one lands on a fallen tree, another scrambles into a crack 
in a house, and another climbs into a shipping crate. But some will simply saunter 
to sites nearby and become the monarchs 
of the colony’s satellite nests. With one of the longest insect lifespans, a termite queen’s reign can
last more than 20 years. The original queens and kings eventually
die, but by the time they go, several satellite nests
are already thriving. Their reproductive offspring
inherit the throne, meaning that their colony may
persist for decades to come.

**Transcript**:
Tens of thousands of conehead termites
are swarming in the Panamanian air. These 4 young hopefuls are brave— oh... I guess 3. 
Oh, wow, 2 in 1. Okay! This single determined termite 
is braving countless threats to participate in the only flight 
of her lifetime. She evades the onslaught of predators 
even as she lands, flips off her wings, secretes pheromones, and attracts a mate. The pair dash from the danger zone
into a rotting tree stump. It’s the perfect first home—
but they’re not alone. Unlike most termite species, conehead termite colonies can have
multiple queens and kings. The pair is joined by several other
termites ready to reproduce. Together, they excavate
a chamber in the stump, seal the entrance and get busy. When the resulting offspring hatch, they 
bear little resemblance to their parents; they’re smaller, wingless,
eyeless, and sterile. Some of them, the soldiers, have the species’ trademark 
conspicuously shaped heads— the function of which will
soon be revealed. They set out to scout for dead wood,
laying the pheromone trails the rest of the offspring, 
the colony’s workers, follow and reinforce 
as they retrieve food. As the termites collect and decompose 
plant debris, they return essential nutrients
to the soil, allowing more vegetation to thrive. Gradually, worker termites expand
the colony's central chamber as they groom and feed the royals
and the upcoming broods. The tiniest termites can’t yet
eat wood independently. So, the workers process it and gift it 
to the youngsters through their saliva and by basically throwing
up into their mouths. With the workers managing groceries,
construction, and child care, the royals fully commit themselves
to reproduction. The kings provide sperm
on an as-needed basis, and the queens undergo radical
transformations. Their abdomens develop efficient 
egg-laying machinery and extend dramatically. Each queen may produce hundreds
of eggs a day. Meanwhile, a worker entourage retrieves
and neatly stacks them into piles. The colony grows quickly. And once its population is big enough, workers construct a system of tunnels
stretching over 100 meters across terrain, along fallen logs,
and up into tree crowns. These tunnels shelter the termites
as they travel to and from food sites around the clock. And eventually, they build 
a distinctive central nest. Using partially digested 
plant material, soil, and poop, they construct a massive 
egg-shaped structure, complete with numerous passages,
chambers, and ventilation holes. Deep within, they establish a royal cell
that's fortified with extra thick walls. It’s not long before this architectural
marvel attracts an admirer: an anteater. She swipes at the nest 
and pokes her long tongue in. Those trapped in the tongue’s spines 
and sticky saliva are whisked off to their deaths. But the termite soldiers
launch a counterattack. They’re tiny and blind but their heads
function like squirt guns. They secure the anteater’s position
using chemical signals, clench their powerful muscles and shoot
a sticky spray from their heads. After a minute, 
the anteater stops feeding, scratches the goo away, 
and lopes off. The nest sustained some damage, 
but the royals remain undisturbed, pumping out eggs into their
reinforced fortress. As the colony matures, some of the
young develop into reproductives. Most fly off to establish new colonies—
one lands on a fallen tree, another scrambles into a crack 
in a house, and another climbs into a shipping crate. But some will simply saunter 
to sites nearby and become the monarchs 
of the colony’s satellite nests. With one of the longest insect lifespans, a termite queen’s reign can
last more than 20 years. The original queens and kings eventually
die, but by the time they go, several satellite nests
are already thriving. Their reproductive offspring
inherit the throne, meaning that their colony may
persist for decades to come.

**Transcript**:
How do you know you’re a person 
who has lived your life, rather than a just-formed brain
full of artificial memories, momentarily hallucinating a reality
that doesn't actually exist? That may sound absurd, but it’s kept several generations 
of top cosmologists up at night. They call it the Boltzmann brain paradox. Its namesake, Ludwig Boltzmann,
was a 19th century physicist operating in a period when scientists 
were passionately debating whether the universe had existed 
for an infinite or finite time. Boltzmann’s main claim to fame was
revolutionizing thermodynamics, the branch of physics that studies energy. He put forward a new interpretation
of entropy, which is a measure 
of the disorder of a system. A glass is an ordered system, 
whereas a shattered glass is disordered. The second law of thermodynamics states
that closed systems tend towards disorder: you won’t see a shattered glass
return to its pristine state. Boltzmann’s insight was applying 
statistical reasoning to this behavior. He found that a system evolves to a more
disordered state because it’s more likely. However, the opposite direction
isn’t impossible, just so unlikely that we’ll never witness
things like scrambled eggs turning raw. But if the universe exists
over an infinitely long time, extremely unlikely events will happen, including complex things forming 
out of random combinations of particles. So what does that look like in a
hypothetical infinitely old universe? In this unremarkable stretch
of near-nothingness, about eight octillion atoms randomly
come together to form a replica of the Thinker made of pasta. It instantly dissolves. Over here, these particles suddenly form
something like a brain. It’s filled with false memories
of a lifetime up to the present moment, when it perceives a video saying 
these very words, before decaying. And finally, by random fluctuations,
all the particles in the cosmos concentrate in a single point, and an entire new universe spontaneously
bursts into existence. Of those last two, 
which is more likely? The brain, by far— despite all its complexity, it’s a blip
compared to an entire universe. Every one universe produced by random
fluctuations has equivalent odds to heaps upon heaps of insta-brains. So by this reasoning, 
it seems extremely more likely that everything you believe to exist 
is actually a brief illusion, soon to be extinguished. Boltzmann didn’t get quite
that far in his thinking; the brains themselves were introduced by
later cosmologists building on his work. But they, like just about everyone else, were pretty sure that they themselves
weren't just ephemeral brains. So the paradox was: how could they be
correct and the universe be eternal? The resolution is something most take 
for granted today: that our universe
has not existed forever, but rather time and space
started with a Big Bang. So that’s the paradox over and done with,
right? Well, maybe not. In the last century, scientists have found
evidence supporting the theory of the Big Bang everywhere we look. Yet while we know 
that the Big Bang happened, no one knows what, if anything, 
preceded and caused it. Why did the universe begin in such
an extremely ordered, and unlikely, state? Is our universe in an unending cycle
of creation and collapse? Or might we be in one of many universes
expanding within a multiverse? In this context, Boltzmann’s paradox 
has found renewed interest by contemporary cosmologists. Some argue that leading models 
for where the universe came from still imply that Boltzmann brains 
are more likely than human brains, suggesting something’s amiss. Others counter that slight modifications
of the cosmological models would avoid the problem, or that Boltzmann’s brains
can’t actually physically form. Some researchers even attempted 
to calculate the probability of a brain popping out of 
random quantum fluctuations long enough to think a single thought. They got this incredible number whose denominator is 10 to a number 
about a septillion times larger than the number of stars in the universe. The Boltzmann brain paradox,
despite its absurdity, is useful because it creates a bar
that models have to rise to. If, compared to numbers like this one, the current state of the universe
is exceedingly unlikely, something in the model is
almost certainly wrong. Unless you’re the one who is wrong...

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

return to its pristine state. Boltzmann’s insight was applying 
statistical reasoning to this behavior. He found that a system evolves to a more
disordered state because it’s more likely. However, the opposite direction
isn’t impossible, just so unlikely that we’ll never witness
things like scrambled eggs turning raw. But if the universe exists
over an infinitely long time, extremely unlikely events will happen, including complex things forming 
out of random combinations of particles. So what does that look like in a
hypothetical infinitely old universe? In this unremarkable stretch
of near-nothingness, about eight octillion atoms randomly
come together to form a replica of the Thinker made of pasta. It instantly dissolves. Over here, these particles suddenly form
something like a brain. It’s filled with false memories
of a lifetime up to the present moment, when it perceives a video saying 
these very words, before decaying. And finally, by random fluctuations,
all the particles in the cosmos concentrate in a single point, and an entire new universe spontaneously
bursts into existence. Of those last two, 
which is more likely? The brain, by far— despite all its complexity, it’s a blip
compared to an entire universe. Every one universe produced by random
fluctuations has equivalent odds to heaps upon heaps of insta-brains. So by this reasoning, 
it seems extremely more likely that everything you believe to exist 
is actually a brief illusion, soon to be extinguished. Boltzmann didn’t get quite
that far in his thinking; the brains themselves were introduced by
later cosmologists building on his work. But they, like just about everyone else, were pretty sure that they themselves
weren't just ephemeral brains. So the paradox was: how could they be
correct and the universe be eternal? The resolution is something most take 
for granted today: that our universe
has not existed forever, but rather time and space
started with a Big Bang. So that’s the paradox over and done with,
right? Well, maybe not. In the last century, scientists have found
evidence supporting the theory of the Big Bang everywhere we look. Yet while we know 
that the Big Bang happened, no one knows what, if anything, 
preceded and caused it. Why did the universe begin in such
an extremely ordered, and unlikely, state? Is our universe in an unending cycle
of creation and collapse? Or might we be in one of many universes
expanding within a multiverse? In this context, Boltzmann’s paradox 
has found renewed interest by contemporary cosmologists. Some argue that leading models 
for where the universe came from still imply that Boltzmann brains 
are more likely than human brains, suggesting something’s amiss. Others counter that slight modifications
of the cosmological models would avoid the problem, or that Boltzmann’s brains
can’t actually physically form. Some researchers even attempted 
to calculate the probability of a brain popping out of 
random quantum fluctuations long enough to think a single thought. They got this incredible number whose denominator is 10 to a number 
about a septillion times larger than the number of stars in the universe. The Boltzmann brain paradox,
despite its absurdity, is useful because it creates a bar
that models have to rise to. If, compared to numbers like this one, the current state of the universe
is exceedingly unlikely, something in the model is
almost certainly wrong. Unless you’re the one who is wrong...
