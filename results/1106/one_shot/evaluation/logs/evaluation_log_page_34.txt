**Transcript**:
Why do humans drink so much milk? And given that all mammals lactate, why do we favor certain types of milk
over others? Milk is the first thing we drink, and thanks to developments in the
production and variety of dairy products, it can take on countless forms
for our dietary and sensory well-being. Milk's primary function is as a complete
source of nutrition for newborns. In fact, since it has all of the vital
nutrients for development and growth— proteins, carbohydrates, fats,
vitamins and minerals, and water— milk is the only thing a baby
even needs to ingest for the first six months of life. The unique makeup of milk can vary
depending on factors like species, diet, and location. Reindeer of the Arctic Circle,
for example, make energy-dense milk
that's about 20% fat, roughly five times more than human
or cow's milk, to help their young survive
the harsh, freezing climate. So how is milk made? In the uniquely mammalian process
of lactation, a special class of milk-secreting cells
known as mammocytes line up in a single layer
around pear-shaped alveoli. Those cells absorb all of the building
blocks of milk, then synthesize tiny droplets of fat on structures called
smooth endoplasmic reticula. The droplets combine with each other
and other molecules and are then expelled and stored
in spaces between cells. Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk
through the breasts, udders, or, in the rare case of the platypus,
through ducts in the abdomen. Although this process is typically
reserved for females, in some species, like dayak fruit bats,
goats, and even cats, males can also lactate. Milk drinkers worldwide consume
dairy from buffalo, goats, sheeps, camels, yaks, horses, and cows. Almost all of these species are ruminants, a type of mammal with
four-chambered stomachs that yield large quantities of milk. Of these, cows were the most
easily domesticated and produce a milk that is both
easily separated into cream and liquid and has a similar fat content
to human milk. In their natural environment, mammals secrete milk on call
for immediate consumption by their young. But with the demands of thirsty consumers, the dairy industry has enlisted methods
to step up production, enhance shelf life,
and provide a variety of milk products. In the dairy, centrifugation machines
spin milk at high speeds, forcing less dense fats to separate
from the liquid and float up. After being skimmed off, this fat, known as butterfat,
can be used in dairy products like butter, cream, and cheese. Or it can be later added back
to the liquid in varying proportions to yield different fat content milks. Full fat milk, sometimes referred
to as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added compared to 1 to 2%
for low and reduced fat milk, and less than half a percent
for skim milk. To stop reseparation of the fat
from the water, or creaming, the mixture undergoes the high-energy
pressurized process of homogenization. Before milk hits the shelves,
it’s also typically heat treated to reduce its level of microbes— a government-sanctioned process that raw milk enthusiasts argue
may reduce milk's nutritional worth. Milk spoilage is started by microbes, which consume and break
down the nutrients in milk. That process causes butterfat
to clump together, leading to a visually unpleasant product. And the byproducts of
the microbes' consumption are compounds that taste
and smell nasty. But there's a bigger problem. Raw milk can carry microbes that are
the sources of deadly diseases, so in order to kill as many of those
microbes as possible, and keep milk fresh longer, we use a technique called pasteurization. One version of this process involves
exposing milk to about 30 seconds of high heat. Another version,
called ultra-high temperature processing, or ultra pasteurization, blasts the milk with considerably higher
temperatures over just a few seconds. UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life, up to twelve months unrefrigerated, compared to pasteurized milk's
two weeks in the fridge. That's because the higher temperatures
of UHT processing inactivate far more microbes. Yet the higher processing temperatures may adversely affect the nutritional
and sensory properties of the milk. Ultimately, that choice lies
in the consumer's taste and need for convenience. Fortunately, there are many
choices available in an industry that produces in excess
of 840 million tons of products each year.

the harsh, freezing climate. So how is milk made? In the uniquely mammalian process
of lactation, a special class of milk-secreting cells
known as mammocytes line up in a single layer
around pear-shaped alveoli. Those cells absorb all of the building
blocks of milk, then synthesize tiny droplets of fat on structures called
smooth endoplasmic reticula. The droplets combine with each other
and other molecules and are then expelled and stored
in spaces between cells. Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk
through the breasts, udders, or, in the rare case of the platypus,
through ducts in the abdomen. Although this process is typically
reserved for females, in some species, like dayak fruit bats,
goats, and even cats, males can also lactate. Milk drinkers worldwide consume
dairy from buffalo, goats, sheeps, camels, yaks, horses, and cows. Almost all of these species are ruminants, a type of mammal with
four-chambered stomachs that yield large quantities of milk. Of these, cows were the most
easily domesticated and produce a milk that is both
easily separated into cream and liquid and has a similar fat content
to human milk. In their natural environment, mammals secrete milk on call
for immediate consumption by their young. But with the demands of thirsty consumers, the dairy industry has enlisted methods
to step up production, enhance shelf life,
and provide a variety of milk products. In the dairy, centrifugation machines
spin milk at high speeds, forcing less dense fats to separate
from the liquid and float up. After being skimmed off, this fat, known as butterfat,
can be used in dairy products like butter, cream, and cheese. Or it can be later added back
to the liquid in varying proportions to yield different fat content milks. Full fat milk, sometimes referred
to as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added compared to 1 to 2%
for low and reduced fat milk, and less than half a percent
for skim milk. To stop reseparation of the fat
from the water, or creaming, the mixture undergoes the high-energy
pressurized process of homogenization. Before milk hits the shelves,
it’s also typically heat treated to reduce its level of microbes— a government-sanctioned process that raw milk enthusiasts argue
may reduce milk's nutritional worth. Milk spoilage is started by microbes, which consume and break
down the nutrients in milk. That process causes butterfat
to clump together, leading to a visually unpleasant product. And the byproducts of
the microbes' consumption are compounds that taste
and smell nasty. But there's a bigger problem. Raw milk can carry microbes that are
the sources of deadly diseases, so in order to kill as many of those
microbes as possible, and keep milk fresh longer, we use a technique called pasteurization. One version of this process involves
exposing milk to about 30 seconds of high heat. Another version,
called ultra-high temperature processing, or ultra pasteurization, blasts the milk with considerably higher
temperatures over just a few seconds. UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life, up to twelve months unrefrigerated, compared to pasteurized milk's
two weeks in the fridge. That's because the higher temperatures
of UHT processing inactivate far more microbes. Yet the higher processing temperatures may adversely affect the nutritional
and sensory properties of the milk. Ultimately, that choice lies
in the consumer's taste and need for convenience. Fortunately, there are many
choices available in an industry that produces in excess
of 840 million tons of products each year.

**Transcript**:
If you're ever walking down the street and come across an oddly stretched out
image, like this, you'll have an opportunity
to see something remarkable, but only if you stand in exactly
the right spot. That happens because these works
employ a technique called anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a special case
of perspective art, where artists represent realistic
three-dimensional views on two-dimensional surfaces. Though it's common today, this kind of perspective drawing has only
been around since the Italian Renaissance. Ancient art often showed all figures
on the same plane, varying in size by symbolic importance. Classical Greek and Roman artists realized
they could make objects seem further by drawing them smaller, but many early attempts at perspective
were inconsistent or incorrect. In 15th century Florence, artists realized the illusion 
of perspective could be achieved with higher degrees
of sophistication by applying mathematical principles. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci 
manipulated the mathematics to create the first known 
anamorphic drawing. A number of other artists later
picked up the technique, including Hans Holbein 
in "The Ambassadors." This painting features a distorted
shape that forms into a skull as the viewer approaches from the side. In order to understand how artists
achieve that effect, we first have to understand how 
perspective drawings work in general. Imagine looking out a window. Light bounces off objects 
and into your eye, intersecting the window along the way. Now, imagine you could paint the image
you see directly onto the window while standing still and keeping
only one eye open. The result would be nearly
indistinguishable from the actual view with your brain adding depth
to the 2-D picture, but only from that one spot. Standing even just a bit off
to the side would make the drawing 
lose its 3-D effect. Artists understand that 
a perspective drawing is just a projection
onto a 2-D plane. This allows them to use math to come up
with basic rules of perspective that allow them to draw without a window. One is that parallel lines, like these, can only be drawn as parallel if they're
parallel to the plane of the canvas. Otherwise, they need to be drawn
converging to a common point known as the vanishing point. So that's a standard perspective drawing. With an anamorphic drawing,
like "The Ambassadors," directly facing the canvas makes the image
look stretched and distorted, but put your eye in exactly the right spot
way off to the side, and the skull materializes. Going back to the window analogy, it's as if the artist painted 
onto a window positioned at an angle instead of straight on, though that's not how Renaissance artists
actually created anamorphic drawings. Typically, they draw a normal image 
onto one surface, then use a light, a grid, or even strings to project it
onto a canvas at an angle. Now let's say you want to make
an anamorphic sidewalk drawing. In this case, you want to create
the illusion that a 3-D image has been added
seamlessly into an existing scene. You can first put a window
in front of the sidewalk and draw what you want to add 
onto the window. It should be in the same perspective
as the rest of the scene, which might require the use of those
basic rules of perspective. Once the drawing's complete, you can use a projector placed 
where your eye was to project your drawing down 
onto the sidewalk, then chalk over it. The sidewalk drawing 
and the drawing on the window will be nearly indistinguishable
from that point of view, so viewers' brains will again be tricked into believing that the drawing
on the ground is three-dimensional. And you don't have to project onto
a flat surface to create this illusion. You can project onto multiple surfaces, or assemble a jumble of objects,
that from the right point of view, appears to be something else entirely. All over the planet, you can find
solid surfaces giving way to strange, wonderful,
or terrifying visions. From your sidewalk 
to your computer screen, these are just some of the ways
that math and perspective can open up whole new worlds.

**Transcript**:
If you're ever walking down the street and come across an oddly stretched out
image, like this, you'll have an opportunity
to see something remarkable, but only if you stand in exactly
the right spot. That happens because these works
employ a technique called anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a special case
of perspective art, where artists represent realistic
three-dimensional views on two-dimensional surfaces. Though it's common today, this kind of perspective drawing has only
been around since the Italian Renaissance. Ancient art often showed all figures
on the same plane, varying in size by symbolic importance. Classical Greek and Roman artists realized
they could make objects seem further by drawing them smaller, but many early attempts at perspective
were inconsistent or incorrect. In 15th century Florence, artists realized the illusion 
of perspective could be achieved with higher degrees
of sophistication by applying mathematical principles. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci 
manipulated the mathematics to create the first known 
anamorphic drawing. A number of other artists later
picked up the technique, including Hans Holbein 
in "The Ambassadors." This painting features a distorted
shape that forms into a skull as the viewer approaches from the side. In order to understand how artists
achieve that effect, we first have to understand how 
perspective drawings work in general. Imagine looking out a window. Light bounces off objects 
and into your eye, intersecting the window along the way. Now, imagine you could paint the image
you see directly onto the window while standing still and keeping
only one eye open. The result would be nearly
indistinguishable from the actual view with your brain adding depth
to the 2-D picture, but only from that one spot. Standing even just a bit off
to the side would make the drawing 
lose its 3-D effect. Artists understand that 
a perspective drawing is just a projection
onto a 2-D plane. This allows them to use math to come up
with basic rules of perspective that allow them to draw without a window. One is that parallel lines, like these, can only be drawn as parallel if they're
parallel to the plane of the canvas. Otherwise, they need to be drawn
converging to a common point known as the vanishing point. So that's a standard perspective drawing. With an anamorphic drawing,
like "The Ambassadors," directly facing the canvas makes the image
look stretched and distorted, but put your eye in exactly the right spot
way off to the side, and the skull materializes. Going back to the window analogy, it's as if the artist painted 
onto a window positioned at an angle instead of straight on, though that's not how Renaissance artists
actually created anamorphic drawings. Typically, they draw a normal image 
onto one surface, then use a light, a grid, or even strings to project it
onto a canvas at an angle. Now let's say you want to make
an anamorphic sidewalk drawing. In this case, you want to create
the illusion that a 3-D image has been added
seamlessly into an existing scene. You can first put a window
in front of the sidewalk and draw what you want to add 
onto the window. It should be in the same perspective
as the rest of the scene, which might require the use of those
basic rules of perspective. Once the drawing's complete, you can use a projector placed 
where your eye was to project your drawing down 
onto the sidewalk, then chalk over it. The sidewalk drawing 
and the drawing on the window will be nearly indistinguishable
from that point of view, so viewers' brains will again be tricked into believing that the drawing
on the ground is three-dimensional. And you don't have to project onto
a flat surface to create this illusion. You can project onto multiple surfaces, or assemble a jumble of objects,
that from the right point of view, appears to be something else entirely. All over the planet, you can find
solid surfaces giving way to strange, wonderful,
or terrifying visions. From your sidewalk 
to your computer screen, these are just some of the ways
that math and perspective can open up whole new worlds.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time it took for artists to begin distorting perspective after the mathematical principles of perspective were discovered in the early 15th century. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific question.

However, Question 2: "When did artists first start using perspective drawing?" is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, as it deals with the timeline of perspective drawing. Although it does not specifically ask about anamorphism or the time it took for artists to begin distorting perspective, it is the closest match among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 2 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
There's a lot of buzz in the news about de-extinction. With the growing interest in technologies and research, that could possibly bring animals and plants back from being, well, extinct. One of the candidates high on that list is the woolly mammoth. They're the closest relatives to our living Asian elephants today, and only widely disappeared about 10,000 years ago. With some isolated populations hanging on until about 4,700 years ago. That may seem like a long time, but at that period in the not-so-distant past, glass was being invented and the great pyramids of Giza were being built. So, really, it's a blip in the scheme of things. Since woolly mammoth's genetic information has been so well preserved in the permafrost, where recent specimens have been discovered, scientists have been able to sequence their genomes and now different groups are trying to figure out a way to insert mammoth genes into living elephant cells and maybe, in a way, bring them back. But my question is, why mammoths? Why not, say, mastodons? No, not the heavy metal group, the late miocene megafauna. Modern day elephants, mammoths and mastodons are all in the order proboscidea, along with other exinct tusked creatures, like palaeomastodons and gomphotheres. From the outside, mammoths and mastodons may look pretty similar, but they've been different for a very long time. About 25 million years. Mastodons were on Earth long before the mammoths, who showed up a little late to the Pleistocene party about 20 million years later. So you couldn't hope to have good luck splicing mastodon DNA into the Asian elephant genome. That's like putting human cells into a gibbon. It wouldn't work because the two are too genetically different. In addition to genetic differences between mammoths and mastodons, they're also morphologically different. This is most obviously seen in their teeth. Mammoths have large, flat, grinding surfaces on top of their molars, whereas mastodons have giant, mountain-like cusps. These cusps even inspired their scientific name, from the Greek word "masto" for "breast" and "odon" for "tooth." Literally breast tooth. The shape of their teeth gives us clues about their diets, too. Mammoths were grazers, like cows and elephants today and as such, they have flat grinding surfaces on their teeth for breaking down grasses. Mastodons were browsers, like goats. The bulbous cusps on their teeth were useful for breaking down sticks and shrubs. So, remember, mammoths: cows. Matsodons: breast-toothed goats. In addition to differences in their dentition, mastodons were shorter stockier than mammoths with smaller ears, but there were some exceptions. Mammoths and mastodons are in two different genera, Mammut and Mammuthus. There were four different mastodon species and ten different species of mammoth. You're probably most familiar with the woolly mammoth but there was also a pygmy species, the dwarf mammoth, which was about as tall as I am. This species was found on the Channel Islands off of California and its small size was most likely result of island dwarfism. This can happen when a large species gets isolated on an island, since smaller animals require fewer food resources, and in the absence of predators, small animals tend to breed more quickly than their larger counterparts. As to how they got to the island, how else? They swam! Elephants today are great long-distance swimmers with their built-in snorkels and buoyant mass. Smelling delicious grasses from mainland California, a group of Columbian mammoths departed the coast, swimming out into the ocean towards the smell. Fast forward 30,000 years and congratulations! Almost puppy sized mammoths. While there isn't yet a conclusive answer as to what caused the extinction for both mammoths and mastodons in the last 10,000 years, whether it was from over-hunting by humans or climate related changes, a few questions remain. If we can resurrect the mammoth genome, should we? And where would we put them?

In addition to differences in their dentition, mastodons were shorter stockier than mammoths with smaller ears, but there were some exceptions. Mammoths and mastodons are in two different genera, Mammut and Mammuthus. There were four different mastodon species and ten different species of mammoth. You're probably most familiar with the woolly mammoth but there was also a pygmy species, the dwarf mammoth, which was about as tall as I am. This species was found on the Channel Islands off of California and its small size was most likely result of island dwarfism. This can happen when a large species gets isolated on an island, since smaller animals require fewer food resources, and in the absence of predators, small animals tend to breed more quickly than their larger counterparts. As to how they got to the island, how else? They swam! Elephants today are great long-distance swimmers with their built-in snorkels and buoyant mass. Smelling delicious grasses from mainland California, a group of Columbian mammoths departed the coast, swimming out into the ocean towards the smell. Fast forward 30,000 years and congratulations! Almost puppy sized mammoths. While there isn't yet a conclusive answer as to what caused the extinction for both mammoths and mastodons in the last 10,000 years, whether it was from over-hunting by humans or climate related changes, a few questions remain. If we can resurrect the mammoth genome, should we? And where would we put them?

**Transcript**:
There's a lot of buzz in the news about de-extinction. With the growing interest in technologies and research, that could possibly bring animals and plants back from being, well, extinct. One of the candidates high on that list is the woolly mammoth. They're the closest relatives to our living Asian elephants today, and only widely disappeared about 10,000 years ago. With some isolated populations hanging on until about 4,700 years ago. That may seem like a long time, but at that period in the not-so-distant past, glass was being invented and the great pyramids of Giza were being built. So, really, it's a blip in the scheme of things. Since woolly mammoth's genetic information has been so well preserved in the permafrost, where recent specimens have been discovered, scientists have been able to sequence their genomes and now different groups are trying to figure out a way to insert mammoth genes into living elephant cells and maybe, in a way, bring them back. But my question is, why mammoths? Why not, say, mastodons? No, not the heavy metal group, the late miocene megafauna. Modern day elephants, mammoths and mastodons are all in the order proboscidea, along with other exinct tusked creatures, like palaeomastodons and gomphotheres. From the outside, mammoths and mastodons may look pretty similar, but they've been different for a very long time. About 25 million years. Mastodons were on Earth long before the mammoths, who showed up a little late to the Pleistocene party about 20 million years later. So you couldn't hope to have good luck splicing mastodon DNA into the Asian elephant genome. That's like putting human cells into a gibbon. It wouldn't work because the two are too genetically different. In addition to genetic differences between mammoths and mastodons, they're also morphologically different. This is most obviously seen in their teeth. Mammoths have large, flat, grinding surfaces on top of their molars, whereas mastodons have giant, mountain-like cusps. These cusps even inspired their scientific name, from the Greek word "masto" for "breast" and "odon" for "tooth." Literally breast tooth. The shape of their teeth gives us clues about their diets, too. Mammoths were grazers, like cows and elephants today and as such, they have flat grinding surfaces on their teeth for breaking down grasses. Mastodons were browsers, like goats.

**Transcript**:
Why do skunks smell so bad? It all comes down to chemistry. By the way, this video will include slow motion
footage of skunk anuses. So, be warned. I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. There are a number of species of skunk in
the world, but the most iconic has to be the striped skunk. That’s the one that looks like Pepe Le Pew—it’s
all black, typically with one white line that usually splits into two on its back. And it can be found all over the United States
as well as northern Mexico and southern Canada. Its latin name is Mephitis mephitis, which
appropriately enough means something like foul stench or noxious vapor. Obviously, that’s because the most defining
character of skunks is their defensive spray, which can cause watery eyes, nausea, and leave
you smelling terrible. The chemical makeup of the spray is different
depending on the species, but all of them contain special types of compounds called
“thiols.” Thiols, also known as “mercaptans,” are
a type of chemical group made up of a sulfur and hydrogen atom bonded together. And they typically smell really strongly. There are actually three different thiols
in striped skunks spray, and two of those are the main contributors to the awful odor. But three other molecules in the spray are
what are called “thioacetates.” Those compounds don’t have a strong scent,
but they can easily become thiols when they’re exposed to water. And that might explain why a pet that gets
sprayed may start to smell skunky again after a bath. Now, skunk musk is produced by anal scent
glands—which actually, lots of mammals have, though most aren’t quite this exciting. When a skunk sprays, nipple-like protrusions
called papillae come out of the anus and squirt the musk at the target. The bad news is they can squirt a distance
of about 10 feet, and are uncannily good at hitting their mark. The good news is that skunks really don’t
want to spray unless they have to, and adults usually give warning signals beforehand. Striped skunks will hiss, stomp, and raise
their tails before spraying. And spotted skunks will even do a handstand. But, what should you do on the off-chance
that you wind up covered in musk? Well, definitely don’t use tomato juice—that’s
just a myth. Instead, use something that converts the thiol
into a different type of compound. Some scientists suggest using a mixture of
dilute hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a little liquid soap, which will oxidize the
thiol and turn it into a sulfonic acid. But be careful, because it could dye your
hair or pet fur. Anyway, despite their terrible reputation,
some skunks have actually been domesticated, and people say they make really cute and affectionate
pets. But if you do want a pet skunk, make sure
you know how to take care of it and get one from a breeder. Grabbing one from the woods is not at all
nice for the skunk. And it would probably let you know that by
squirting you with an anal gland full of noxious musk. Ew.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the primary habitat of the iconic striped skunk. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the habitat, Question 2 mentions the Latin name of the striped skunk, which is related to the species mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to geography or location, I would suggest Question 6, which asks about the effective range of a skunk's defensive spray. Although it's not directly related to habitat, it mentions a distance (up to 10 feet), which could be indirectly related to the skunk's environment or territory.

But, if I'm being completely honest, none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 6 is the most similar, but please note that it's a very weak similarity.

Index: 6

**Transcript**:
Why do skunks smell so bad? It all comes down to chemistry. By the way, this video will include slow motion
footage of skunk anuses. So, be warned. I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. There are a number of species of skunk in
the world, but the most iconic has to be the striped skunk. That’s the one that looks like Pepe Le Pew—it’s
all black, typically with one white line that usually splits into two on its back. And it can be found all over the United States
as well as northern Mexico and southern Canada. Its latin name is Mephitis mephitis, which
appropriately enough means something like foul stench or noxious vapor. Obviously, that’s because the most defining
character of skunks is their defensive spray, which can cause watery eyes, nausea, and leave
you smelling terrible. The chemical makeup of the spray is different
depending on the species, but all of them contain special types of compounds called
“thiols.” Thiols, also known as “mercaptans,” are
a type of chemical group made up of a sulfur and hydrogen atom bonded together. And they typically smell really strongly. There are actually three different thiols
in striped skunks spray, and two of those are the main contributors to the awful odor. But three other molecules in the spray are
what are called “thioacetates.” Those compounds don’t have a strong scent,
but they can easily become thiols when they’re exposed to water. And that might explain why a pet that gets
sprayed may start to smell skunky again after a bath. Now, skunk musk is produced by anal scent
glands—which actually, lots of mammals have, though most aren’t quite this exciting. When a skunk sprays, nipple-like protrusions
called papillae come out of the anus and squirt the musk at the target. The bad news is they can squirt a distance
of about 10 feet, and are uncannily good at hitting their mark. The good news is that skunks really don’t
want to spray unless they have to, and adults usually give warning signals beforehand. Striped skunks will hiss, stomp, and raise
their tails before spraying. And spotted skunks will even do a handstand. But, what should you do on the off-chance
that you wind up covered in musk? Well, definitely don’t use tomato juice—that’s
just a myth. Instead, use something that converts the thiol
into a different type of compound. Some scientists suggest using a mixture of
dilute hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a little liquid soap, which will oxidize the
thiol and turn it into a sulfonic acid. But be careful, because it could dye your
hair or pet fur. Anyway, despite their terrible reputation,
some skunks have actually been domesticated, and people say they make really cute and affectionate
pets. But if you do want a pet skunk, make sure
you know how to take care of it and get one from a breeder. Grabbing one from the woods is not at all
nice for the skunk. And it would probably let you know that by
squirting you with an anal gland full of noxious musk. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Pretty much as long as humans have looked
up at the night sky, we’ve been studying astronomy. In all this time, we’ve learned so much
about the universe beyond our Solar System, and have found lots of exoplanets orbiting
other stars. But there’s a lot that scientists still
don’t know. In fact, three relatively recent exoplanet
discoveries are completely baffling researchers because, according to what we know about astronomy,
they shouldn’t exist! The first of these planets is called Kepler-78b, which was discovered using data from NASA’s
Kepler space telescope, and orbits a star about 400 light years away
from Earth. Based on changes in its star’s light, astronomers
calculated that Kepler-78b’s radius is about 1.2 times the radius of Earth and it’s around 1.7 times as massive as
the Earth. This means it also has a similar density to
the Earth, so the researchers think its composition is
similar, too, with lots of rock and iron. But that’s where the similarities stop. Kepler-78b is about 100 times closer to its
star than the Earth is to the Sun, and its surface temperatures might even get
up to 3,100 Kelvin. Basically, it’s kind of like Earth … if
Earth was a blazing inferno. This planet’s super close orbit to its host
star means that a year only lasts 8.5 hours. And scientists don’t understand how Kepler-78b
even exists, because it doesn’t fit any of the current
theories of planetary formation it’s just too close to its star. See, when Kepler-78b was first forming from the gas and dust-filled protoplanetary
disk, its host star was even larger. So if the planet was orbiting where it is
now, it would’ve been inside its star, which
is... impossible. Another option is that it formed farther away
and migrated closer, but scientists think that’s pretty unlikely, since it probably would’ve kept going and
plummeted into the star. As of now, it’s a mystery. The main thing we do know about Kepler-78b is that it’ll probably only be around for
another three billion years or so. It’ll move closer and closer to its host
star, until the gravity eventually tears it apart. Our next mysterious planet is called Kepler-10c, which was also detected using data from the
Kepler space telescope, and is about 560 light years away from us. It’s radius isn’t all that special. It’s only about 2.3 times the radius of
the Earth. And initially, because of its size, scientists predicted that Kepler-10c would
have a thick, gaseous atmosphere, making it like a mini-Neptune. Instead, they found a planet with a mass that
might be between 14-17 times the Earth’s, which suggests that it’s a really dense
rocky planet without much of an atmosphere. A mass that large is basically unheard of
in a planet that size, which is why astronomers dubbed it a mega-Earth. Which, y’know, sounds pretty cool. Based on our current understanding of planets, one this massive without an atmosphere shouldn’t
even exist. Theoretically, it would’ve grabbed a bunch
of nearby lighter elements with its huge gravitational force as the star
system was forming, and turned into a gas giant like Jupiter. But it probably never even had an atmosphere, because if it did at some point, it would’ve
held onto it. So, right now, scientists are just left with
another giant rock in space that they can’t really explain. Last but not least, we have a gas giant named
HD 106906 b, which is 11 times as massive as Jupiter, and discovered using data from the Hubble
Space Telescope and the Magellan telescope in Chile. This planet orbits a really young star 300
light years away from Earth. The system is only 13 million years old. But that’s not what makes it weird. See, HD 106906 b orbits its star at a distance
of 650 astronomical units. That’s more than 20 times the average distance
between the Sun and Neptune. A planet that far away from its host star shouldn’t have had enough gaseous and rocky
materials to grow that huge, especially in such a relatively short period
of time. But, somehow, it exists. Some researchers think it might have formed inside the dust-filled debris disk surrounding
its host star, and got kicked out later, but they’re still
not sure. A recent study seems to support this idea, suggesting that the planet might have even
captured some of that dusty material, and might be surrounded by a ring or shroud. But that’s just one hypothesis and, until
astronomers get more data, the planet is still an enigma. These three planets are just a drop in the
bucket that is our universe, and we still have so much to learn. It’s really the strangest discoveries that
make astronomy so cool. Every time we start to think we understand
how certain things work, like planetary formation, amazing surprises
get thrown our way. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

**Transcript**:
What's so great about the Great Lakes? They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive
that they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water. That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be? The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins. Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between
these basins, and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes
by surface area. Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is
having a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being
degraded and increasingly populated, exposing the once pristine waters to industrial, urban,
and agricultural pollutants. Because less than 1% of the water
leaves the Lake's system annually, decades-old pollutants still lurk
in its waters. Humans have also inadvertently introduced more than 100 non-native
and invasive species into the lakes, such as zebra and quagga mussels,
and sea lampreys that have decimated some indigenous
fish populations. On a larger scale, climate change
is causing the waters to warm, thus reducing water levels and changing
the distribution of aquatic life. Luckily, in recent years, governments have
started to recognize the immense value of this natural resource. Partnerships between the United States and
Canada are underway to reduce pollution, protect coastal habitats, and halt the spread of invasive species. Protecting something as massive
as the Great Lakes system will require the collaboration
of many organizations, but the effort is critical if we can preserve the wonder

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the location of the Great Lakes. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 2 asks "Which of the following is NOT one of the Great Lakes?" and provides a list of options that includes lake names and a non-lake name. This question is related to the geography of the Great Lakes, but it does not directly ask about their location.

However, it's worth noting that the transcript does mention that the Great Lakes "border eight states" which implies that they are located within the United States, but it also mentions that they "contain almost 20% of the world's supply of fresh surface water" which is a fact that is shared with the Canadian territory, the passage does not explicitly state the location as the United States and Canada.

That being said, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that none of the questions are similar, but if I had to choose, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, but only because it is related to the geography of the Great Lakes.

**Transcript**:
What's so great about the Great Lakes? They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive
that they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water. That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be? The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins. Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between
these basins, and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes
by surface area. Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is
having a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the final destination of the water in the Great Lakes. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 7 mentions the flow of water from Lake Superior to the other Great Lakes, which is related to the overall flow of water in the Great Lakes system.

However, a more relevant question is not present in the provided generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 7

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more relevant generated MCQ would be needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, if I had to choose the one that is closest, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar.

Question 4 asks about the percentage of the world's supply of fresh surface water that the Great Lakes contain. While this question does not directly address the benefits provided by the Great Lakes system, it does relate to the importance and uniqueness of the Great Lakes, which is also the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that directly addresses the benefits of the Great Lakes system would be a better match.

**Transcript**:
Perfumers can learn to distinguish
individual odors in a fragrance made of hundreds of scents. Tea experts have been known to sniff out not just the location 
where a tea was from, but the season of harvest
and whether it was planted by a plum tree. And the New York City Transit Authority once had an employee responsible
only for sniffing out gas leaks in the subway system. Can just anyone learn to smell
with the sensitivity of those experts? For most of us, what we smell
is largely involuntary, whether it's garbage behind a restaurant, the shampoo of the woman leaving
an elevator as you enter, or a bakery's fresh-made bread. With a few million olfactory receptors
in our noses, we clearly don't lack the ability
to smell well. We just might not always pay close
enough attention. That's a shame because we may be
missing opportunities to make strong emotional connections. Smells are powerfully linked to emotions and can awaken memories of places
we've long ago left and people we've loved. But fortunately, it is possible
to train our brains to smell better. For example, Helen Keller was able
to recognize a person's work, and in her words, distinguish the carpenter
from the iron worker, the artist from the mason or the chemist, by a simple inhale. Follow these steps and you too can
change the way the world smells to you. First, stick your nose in it. Some animals that are known
to be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives and pigs who can 
find truffles underground, put their noses right at the place
they want to smell. Human noses, meanwhile, are casting
around in the middle of the air, giving us an anatomical disadvantage. So bring your nose close to the world
around you. The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand. Get close to your dog, your partner, the book you're reading. Not only will your nose be closer
to the odor source, but the warmth of your breath
will make odors easier to smell. Second, sniff like you mean it. Smelling actually happens way up near
the bridge of our noses in a postage stamp-sized square
of tissue called the olfactory epithelium. When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked
up into our nostrils until they hit this tissue where they combine to our olfactory,
or scent, receptors. When we inhale normally,
only a little air makes it there. But one or two solid sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to
your smell receptors. After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at
noticing new smells, turn off temporarily. So you can give your nose a rest
and sniff again later. Finally, dwell on the smell. Most smells pass by us 
with little attention, but simply noticing what you're smelling and by trying to describe it, name it,
and locate its source, you can expand your vocabulary of smells. When an odor molecule binds
to a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal
from the sensory neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs. The signal then continues to other
areas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste, memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell. FMRI research shows that the extra
time spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers. For them, perceiving and imagining odors
becomes more automatic than for non-experts. To get started yourself, take ingredients
from your kitchen: spices, vanilla, or fruit, but never anything toxic. Close your eyes and have someone
bring them under your nose. Sniff and try to name the source. Over time, you'll begin to appreciate
nuances in familiar odors and recognize characteristics of new
and unusual smells. The perfumer has practiced these steps
enough to become an artist of odor, but even if you never pursue smelling
to that degree, the spectacular result 
of an unspectacular action will change how you sense 
and experience your days.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about what most people tend to smell, and the correct option is "involuntary." While none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 3 touches on a related topic, discussing the link between smells and emotions.

However, a more relevant question that might match the intent of the ground truth MCQ is not present among the generated MCQs. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the sense of smell and perception, I would suggest:

 Question 3 is not the best match, but since the Question 2 discusses the ability to smell and mentions "a few million olfactory receptors in our noses," which is related to the sense of smell, it might be considered a very distant match.

 Nevertheless, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose I would say:

only for sniffing out gas leaks in the subway system. Can just anyone learn to smell
with the sensitivity of those experts? For most of us, what we smell
is largely involuntary, whether it's garbage behind a restaurant, the shampoo of the woman leaving
an elevator as you enter, or a bakery's fresh-made bread. With a few million olfactory receptors
in our noses, we clearly don't lack the ability
to smell well. We just might not always pay close
enough attention. That's a shame because we may be
missing opportunities to make strong emotional connections. Smells are powerfully linked to emotions and can awaken memories of places
we've long ago left and people we've loved. But fortunately, it is possible
to train our brains to smell better. For example, Helen Keller was able
to recognize a person's work, and in her words, distinguish the carpenter
from the iron worker, the artist from the mason or the chemist, by a simple inhale. Follow these steps and you too can
change the way the world smells to you. First, stick your nose in it. Some animals that are known
to be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives and pigs who can 
find truffles underground, put their noses right at the place
they want to smell. Human noses, meanwhile, are casting
around in the middle of the air, giving us an anatomical disadvantage. So bring your nose close to the world
around you. The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand. Get close to your dog, your partner, the book you're reading. Not only will your nose be closer
to the odor source, but the warmth of your breath
will make odors easier to smell. Second, sniff like you mean it. Smelling actually happens way up near
the bridge of our noses in a postage stamp-sized square
of tissue called the olfactory epithelium. When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked
up into our nostrils until they hit this tissue where they combine to our olfactory,
or scent, receptors. When we inhale normally,
only a little air makes it there. But one or two solid sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to
your smell receptors. After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at
noticing new smells, turn off temporarily. So you can give your nose a rest
and sniff again later. Finally, dwell on the smell. Most smells pass by us 
with little attention, but simply noticing what you're smelling and by trying to describe it, name it,
and locate its source, you can expand your vocabulary of smells. When an odor molecule binds
to a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal
from the sensory neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs. The signal then continues to other
areas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste, memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell. FMRI research shows that the extra
time spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers. For them, perceiving and imagining odors
becomes more automatic than for non-experts. To get started yourself, take ingredients
from your kitchen: spices, vanilla, or fruit, but never anything toxic. Close your eyes and have someone
bring them under your nose. Sniff and try to name the source. Over time, you'll begin to appreciate
nuances in familiar odors and recognize characteristics of new
and unusual smells. The perfumer has practiced these steps
enough to become an artist of odor, but even if you never pursue smelling
to that degree, the spectacular result 
of an unspectacular action will change how you sense 
and experience your days.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7: What happens to the scent receptors in the nose after a few sniffs? 

However, the correct answer in Question 7 is indeed related to the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ, but it does not directly address the primary claim of the ground truth MCQ. 

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about what olfactory receptors detect best. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct match among the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
If you look at cars from the 1970s and cars
from the 1990s, there’s really one big difference in their designs. The ones from the 70s are boxy, and the ones
from the 90s are curvy. For some car models, you can even tell the
exact year when that change happened. Just look at this commercial for the Buick
LeSabre, showing the 1991 model — and then the 1992 model. See the curves? Let’s watch that again. ‘91 is boxy, sharp edges. ‘92? Smooth and round. Since then, cars have become curvier and curvier. So how did this happen? When manufacturers started making curvy cars
in the 90s, it wasn’t a totally new concept. Back in the 1930s, streamliners like this Chrysler
Airflow used this sleek design to reduce wind resistance. But as the 50s and 60s rolled around, American
streamliners stopped selling well — they were outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Gas prices were on fairly steady decline at
this point, so streamlining for fuel efficiency was less of a concern. Well into the 1970s, just about every car
made in America had sharp edges and very few curves. They were basically designed as a series of
three boxes — the hood, the cabin, and the trunk. That model worked really well in the US market. But in Europe, fuel was always more expensive. In the 60s, a gallon of gas in France cost
a whopping 73.1 cents while it was just 31 cents in the US. So European designers started experimenting
with more aerodynamic designs to help cars move more easily so they’d waste less gas. Automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz
— they all started rolling out car models that had curved exteriors. Eventually American automakers started to
copy the European aerodynamic look to try to attract upscale consumers. The mass market was a different picture. In Europe, a designer named Uwe Bahnsen was
the first person to push for a curved design for the average driver, and he did that with
the 1982 Ford Sierra. It was curvier than any car in its class at
the time. But critics just laughed at it. And it didn't sell very well at first. It was nicknamed the “jelly mould” because
of how much it looked like the kind of circular shape you’d make JELL-O with. But one of the designers from that European
Ford design team — this guy, Jack Telnack — took over the US design team in 1980. American gas prices at this point were skyrocketing
due to conflict in the middle east. So Telnack brought wind tunnel testing into
the design process. He first did that with the 1983 Ford Thunderbird. But the real breakthrough came a few years
later: "The result was the groundbreaking 1986 Ford
Taurus." It might not look that groundbreaking now,
but this style was revolutionary at the time. It was a mass market car with curvy edges
— and people liked it. “Taurus! Now a North American car with a shape and
a feel we’ve never seen before… Taurus for us!” They used it in RoboCop as the car of the
future. The sales basically saved Ford, which had
really been struggling at the time, and it inspired a whole wave of copycat curvy cars. And streamlining became even more popular
because manufacturers were facing new fuel economy regulations in the US. Starting in 1978, the average fuel efficiency
of each manufacturer’s passenger cars had to meet higher and higher levels. According to one Ford designer, aerodynamic
design was a much more affordable way to boost efficiency than doing engineering work under
the hood. The rise of computer modelling in the 80s
also made it easier for car makers to design and manufacture curved lines. All these years later, the influence on today’s
cars is pretty clear. Even the models that we criticize for being
ridiculously boxy these days — like the Scion xB — are actually really round. And if our modern day sci fi movies have anything
to say about it, that won’t be changing anytime soon.

Some of the world's most recognizable
symbols exist to sell products, others to steer traffic or advance political causes. But there's one whose main purpose
is to help people. You may know it as the wheelchair symbol,
or a sign for people with disabilities, but its formal title as maintained
by the ISO is the International Symbol of Access. But despite its familiarity, many people are unclear as to what 
the symbol actually means, which has a lot to do with the symbol
itself and the way it came about. In 1968, the International Commission
on Technology and Accessibility held a design contest. They were looking for a symbol that would be readily identifiable 
from a reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, practical, and couldn't be confused
with existing signage. The winning design, 
which didn't have a head, was created by a Danish designer
named Susanne Koefed. The addition of a head a year later
gave it a more human form, and within ten years, it was endorsed by both the United Nations
and the ISO. With minimal cost and minimal fuss,
a global icon was born. There have been a few tweaks
over the decades. The Graphic Artists Guild added more
rounded, human-like features, and in 2012, the Accessible Icon Project
produced a more dynamic version. But what does it really represent? What's its purpose? Put simply, it's a sign to identify where
there are accessible facilities. The strength of such an internationally
recognized image is that wherever you travel, you don't need to speak the language
or have in-depth cultural knowledge. If you require an accessible toilet,
the sign shows the way. But the confusion comes 
from the term accessibility and what that actually means. Many people assume that because
the symbol depicts a wheelchair, that accessible facilities are meant
only for people who use wheelchairs, or those, at the very least,
who have a visible physical condition. But accessibility is a broad concept that applies to many, 
many different conditions. That includes people with autism, visual impairments, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus, which can cause 
pain and fatigue, along with many other conditions. In fact, the World Health 
Organization estimates that there are approximately
1 billion people who experience some form of disability, which means that this group is very
likely to include yourself, or a family member, a classmate, a friend, or a work colleague. And people who use wheelchairs only
make up about 65 million, or 15% of the total. The vast majority 
have non-visible disabilities. Accessible parking spaces, facilities,
and entrances are designed with 
that entire group in mind. So it's easy to see why in recent years
people have begun to raise questions about whether the symbol is really
appropriate for what it's meant to do. And it's not just about accuracy. It's common for people 
to become indignant, sometimes abusive, when they see people without visible
disabilities using accessible facilities. The symbol is unfortunately creating
widespread issues for the very people and families
it's meant to help. The recent redesigns have attempted
with some success to acknowledge concerns 
over the current symbol. But some think that a complete redesign
is in order. It's a difficult task, though. How do you replace a symbol 
that's familiar the world over? And what do you replace it with?

many different conditions. That includes people with autism, visual impairments, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus, which can cause 
pain and fatigue, along with many other conditions. In fact, the World Health 
Organization estimates that there are approximately
1 billion people who experience some form of disability, which means that this group is very
likely to include yourself, or a family member, a classmate, a friend, or a work colleague. And people who use wheelchairs only
make up about 65 million, or 15% of the total. The vast majority 
have non-visible disabilities. Accessible parking spaces, facilities,
and entrances are designed with 
that entire group in mind. So it's easy to see why in recent years
people have begun to raise questions about whether the symbol is really
appropriate for what it's meant to do. And it's not just about accuracy. It's common for people 
to become indignant, sometimes abusive, when they see people without visible
disabilities using accessible facilities. The symbol is unfortunately creating
widespread issues for the very people and families
it's meant to help. The recent redesigns have attempted
with some success to acknowledge concerns 
over the current symbol. But some think that a complete redesign
is in order. It's a difficult task, though. How do you replace a symbol 
that's familiar the world over? And what do you replace it with?

**Transcript**:
Some of the world's most recognizable
symbols exist to sell products, others to steer traffic or advance political causes. But there's one whose main purpose
is to help people. You may know it as the wheelchair symbol,
or a sign for people with disabilities, but its formal title as maintained
by the ISO is the International Symbol of Access. But despite its familiarity, many people are unclear as to what 
the symbol actually means, which has a lot to do with the symbol
itself and the way it came about. In 1968, the International Commission
on Technology and Accessibility held a design contest. They were looking for a symbol that would be readily identifiable 
from a reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, practical, and couldn't be confused
with existing signage. The winning design, 
which didn't have a head, was created by a Danish designer
named Susanne Koefed. The addition of a head a year later
gave it a more human form, and within ten years, it was endorsed by both the United Nations
and the ISO. With minimal cost and minimal fuss,
a global icon was born. There have been a few tweaks
over the decades. The Graphic Artists Guild added more
rounded, human-like features, and in 2012, the Accessible Icon Project
produced a more dynamic version. But what does it really represent? What's its purpose? Put simply, it's a sign to identify where
there are accessible facilities. The strength of such an internationally
recognized image is that wherever you travel, you don't need to speak the language
or have in-depth cultural knowledge. If you require an accessible toilet,
the sign shows the way. But the confusion comes 
from the term accessibility and what that actually means. Many people assume that because
the symbol depicts a wheelchair, that accessible facilities are meant
only for people who use wheelchairs, or those, at the very least,
who have a visible physical condition. But accessibility is a broad concept that applies to many, 
many different conditions. That includes people with autism, visual impairments, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus, which can cause

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the essential qualities listed when the design contest for the International Symbol of Access was launched. The most similar generated MCQ would be one that asks about the design or creation of the International Symbol of Access.

Based on this, I would suggest Question 3: What was added to the original design of the International Symbol of Access in 1969? However, this question does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to pick one, it would be Question 3 (Index 3). However, please note that this is not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What percentage of people with disabilities use wheelchairs? Options: A. 5%, B. 10%, C. 15%, D. 20% 

Although the question is phrased differently, the content and intent are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks if the majority of individuals with disabilities are people in wheelchairs, and the correct answer is False. Question 6 provides more specific information about the percentage of people with disabilities who use wheelchairs, which is 15% according to the transcript. This information directly relates to the ground truth MCQ and provides evidence to support the correct answer.

However, if we're looking for a generated MCQ that more directly matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content, we might consider Question 4: What is the main purpose of the International Symbol of Access? or Question 10: What is the main issue with the current International Symbol of Access? 

But among the options, Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician, but ever since you criticized
the emperor's tax laws, you’ve been locked in the dungeon 
with only a marker to count the days. But one day you're suddenly brought
before the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted
of paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way 
into the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn 
your freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking
coins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very
slightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown 
back into the dungeon. You look around for
anything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room,
just the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin
against all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins
at the same time by splitting the stack 
into multiple piles, then narrowing down where
the false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins 
into three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale
gives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance, 
all eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among 
the remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results?
That’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic
coins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked
coin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus 
on the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier, 
or a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins
and weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins, 
the heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles
you way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side
with a plus and those on the lighter side 
with a minus. You can also mark the remaining four
coins with zeros, since you know the fake one 
is already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity
in just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need 
to reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three 
of the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those
with three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side 
of the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining 
plus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the 
lighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it 
against one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side 
became lighter, that means one of the three minus coins
you moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced
after your substitution, then one of the three plus coins 
you removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one. The emperor nods approvingly
at your finding, and the counterfeiting lord 
takes your place in the dungeon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If you know that among four otherwise identical coins one is heavier than the others, what is the minimum number of weighs you would need to uncover the single counterfeit coin?
Options: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQs**:
Question 1: What is the problem presented to the mathematician by the emperor? Options: A. To find the counterfeit coin among 12 coins using a balance scale without any limitations., B. To find the counterfeit coin among 12 coins using a balance scale with only three attempts., C. To find the counterfeit coin among 12 coins without using a balance scale., D. To find the counterfeit coin among 12 coins using a marker only. Correct Option: None
Question 2: How does the mathematician initially divide the 12 coins? Options: A. Into two equal piles of six., B. Into three equal piles of four., C. Into four equal piles of three., D. Into six equal piles of two. Correct Option: None
Question 3: What does the mathematician use to mark the coins? Options: A. A pen., B. A pencil., C. A marker., D. A piece of chalk. Correct Option: None
Question 4: What does the mathematician mark on the coins to keep track of the results? Options: A. A tick for heavier coins and a cross for lighter coins., B. A plus for heavier coins and a minus for lighter coins., C. A zero for authentic coins and a one for counterfeit coins., D. A letter for each coin. Correct Option: None
Question 5: What is the next step after marking the coins with a plus or minus? Options: A. Weigh two of the newly marked coins against each other., B. Weigh three of the newly marked coins against three unmarked coins., C. Weigh all the marked coins against each other., D. Weigh one marked coin against one unmarked coin. Correct Option: None

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the problem-solving strategy and the concept of weighing coins.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the minimum number of weighs needed to uncover a single counterfeit coin among four identical coins. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 6 mentions the purpose of reassembling the piles after the first weighing, which is related to the strategy of minimizing the number of weighs.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that none of them directly address the minimum number of weighs needed to solve the problem. But Question 1 does mention the problem of finding the counterfeit coin among 12 coins using a balance scale with only three attempts.

Considering the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ, I would argue that Question 1 is the closest match, although it's not a direct match. However, since the correct option for Question 1 is not provided, and the question content does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I must emphasize that this is a weak match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it's not a strong match.

**Transcript**:
You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician, but ever since you criticized
the emperor's tax laws, you’ve been locked in the dungeon 
with only a marker to count the days. But one day you're suddenly brought
before the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted
of paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way 
into the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn 
your freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking
coins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very
slightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown 
back into the dungeon. You look around for
anything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room,
just the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin
against all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins
at the same time by splitting the stack 
into multiple piles, then narrowing down where
the false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins 
into three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale
gives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance, 
all eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among 
the remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results?
That’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic
coins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked
coin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus 
on the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier, 
or a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins
and weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins, 
the heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles
you way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side
with a plus and those on the lighter side 
with a minus. You can also mark the remaining four
coins with zeros, since you know the fake one 
is already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity
in just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need 
to reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three 
of the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those
with three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side 
of the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining 
plus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the 
lighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it 
against one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side 
became lighter, that means one of the three minus coins
you moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced
after your substitution, then one of the three plus coins 
you removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one. The emperor nods approvingly
at your finding, and the counterfeiting lord 
takes your place in the dungeon.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that Question 2 is the closest in terms of content, as it discusses the division of the 12 coins, which is related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the maximum number of coins that can be handled with three weighings.

But if I had to choose one that is most similar in terms of the overall problem, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar, but if I had to choose one, I would say Question 1, because it is the only question that discusses the overall problem presented to the mathematician.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say:

The sight of mistletoe may either send
you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas 
tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines 
the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of
mistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits 
that they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder 
described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England
believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven 
by the gods; that explained its unlikely position 
amongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers 
of healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told 
of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur
and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much 
that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow 
they’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, 
she overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized 
this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow 
carved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such
sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her 
and agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death
into one of peace and love. She mandated a one day
truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath 
its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists 
arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking
species of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales
of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition
from Europe into America. By the 18th century, people 
in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more 
than just human imagination. All of it was inspired
by the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,
but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark 
and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds 
and other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s 
sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed
onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage 
that stays lush even while the surrounding trees 
lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated
our superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s
magical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife
it supports. More than just a parasite, 
it’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,
including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, 
mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species
produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations
for a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic
relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts 
near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity 
and allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, 
that for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power 
to bring things together. And in our own traditions 
we see that happening too.

The sight of mistletoe may either send
you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas 
tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines 
the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of
mistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits 
that they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder 
described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England
believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven 
by the gods; that explained its unlikely position 
amongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers 
of healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told 
of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur
and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much 
that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow 
they’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, 
she overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized 
this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow 
carved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such
sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her 
and agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death
into one of peace and love. She mandated a one day
truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath 
its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists 
arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking
species of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales
of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition
from Europe into America. By the 18th century, people 
in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more 
than just human imagination. All of it was inspired
by the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,
but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark 
and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds 
and other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s 
sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed
onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage 
that stays lush even while the surrounding trees 
lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated
our superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s
magical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife
it supports. More than just a parasite, 
it’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,
including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, 
mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species
produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations
for a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic
relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts 
near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity 
and allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, 
that for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power 
to bring things together. And in our own traditions 
we see that happening too.

**Transcript**:
Why can’t I just get on a plane and go from,
like, Montana to London, in a couple hours? I just want to experience the thrill of zooming
through the sky faster than the speed of sound? Well, if you flew on a Concorde jet back before
they were grounded -- or you happen to be a fighter pilot -- then you’ve probably
experienced faster-than-sound travel. And, some companies are looking to make supersonic
flight a reality again, with new commercial planes that travel faster than the speed of
sound. And someday, you might be able to fly over
the Atlantic Ocean in an hour -- or even less. Problem is, most people don’t want to fly
on a plane that feels like an out-of-control rocket. And there’s also the problem of faster-than-sound
planes becoming ridiculously hot and unbearably loud. So engineers have some developing to
do. On the morning of December 17th, 1903, Orville
Wright became the first human to successfully pilot an airplane -- a heavier-than-air vehicle
that was controlled, powered, and sustained. His flight lasted 12 seconds, and crossed
120 feet of a North Carolinian beach -- with an average speed of almost 11 kilometers an
hour. By the end of the day, his brother Wilbur
flew the same airplane for almost a whole minute, with an average speed of almost 16
kilometers an hour. Less than a century later, in the 1970s, commercial
planes went supersonic -- faster than the speed of sound. A few dozen supersonic planes were in regular
service, available in two models, the Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev. But the Tupolev only
made 55 passenger flights, from 1977 to 1978. And after a Concorde crashed in 2000, people
started to fly on them less. Eventually, they just weren’t financially
worth it anymore, and the planes were retired in 2003. 13 years later, there still aren’t any new
commercial faster-than-sound planes. But soon, there might be! There are just a
couple of improvements companies are trying to make first. The main challenge comes from getting past
what’s known as Mach 1. See, sound usually travels around 1230 kilometers
per hour, but that’s not a constant number -- it depends on things like the temperature
and humidity of the air. So, when it comes to planes, it’s easier
to talk about speed in Mach numbers, which take into account the speed of sound in the
particular place where the plane is flying.. Mach 1 is just the speed of sound. Anything
slower than that is called subsonic, and anything faster is called supersonic. But switching from subsonic to supersonic
isn’t easy, because the plane has to overcome the infamous sound barrier. And that can be a problem, because the sound
barrier is sometimes strong enough to tear away at planes, and even send them crashing
to the ground. The sound barrier exists because of the way
sound waves travel: by compressing and stretching the air they travel through. The compressed air ends up at a higher pressure,
and the stretched air has lower pressure. As a plane moves, it produces sound waves
that shift the air back and forth, creating areas of lower and higher pressure. But as the plane gets faster, it starts to
catch up with those waves. New sound waves start to form on top of the
old sound waves, causing huge swings between higher and lower pressure air. Those differences in pressure can rattle and
shake planes like toys, and there’s a real danger of tearing them to pieces. Low pressure areas can also lead to drops
in temperature, condensing any moisture in the air and forming a visible cloud, sometimes
known as a vapor cone. The first plane that could get past the sound
barrier was the Bell X-1, built in 1947. It was designed to absorb 18 times the force
of gravity, and modeled after a machine gun bullet. It didn’t actually lift off from the ground
on the zone, though -- it was dropped from a larger mothership plane, known as the B-29,
so it got a bit of a head start. By the mid-1970s, supersonic planes were ready
for commercial use -- with the UK and France designing the concorde, and the Soviet Union
designing the Tupolev. The Concorde flew passengers from London to
New York in about three and a half hours -- about half the time it would take in a plain old
subsonic commercial plane. But they only flew that one route, and there’s
a reason they spent as much time over the water as possible: the painfully disruptive
sonic boom. Like the sound barrier, sonic booms come from
a build-up of compressed sound waves, known as a shock wave. The shock wave heads away from the plane,
which you hear as a VERY loud boom -- so powerful that they’re sometimes mistaken for earthquakes. And those sonic booms don’t just happen
once, like when a plane breaks the sound barrier. They continue throughout the entire supersonic
flight. That’s because the sound waves keep bunching
up behind the plane, then expanding outwards, creating a cone shape known as the Mach cone. So wherever the plane flies over land, people
hear that incredibly loud boom. So that’s why the Concorde’s supersonic
commercial flights only really happened between western Europe and eastern North America. If they flew over land, odds are people would
not have appreciated the booms. And even though you can’t fly on a Concorde
anymore, you might still be able to fly on a supersonic plane someday. NASA, for example, is looking into how to
dampen the effects of the sonic boom. One way to do that might be by moving one,
or even two engines above the wings, which would direct shockwaves upwards. So the sonic
booms would happen in the sky, rather than on the ground. Then there’s the Concorde 2, which Airbus
is working on. The Concorde 2 would first fly directly upward,
to an altitude of about 30 kilometers. Then, the plane would rotate its tail fin
in a way that would redirect the shock waves to be horizontal, so you wouldn’t feel them
as much on the ground. The Concorde 2 would be able to accelerate
up to Mach 4.5 -- and at those speeds, it could take passengers from London to New York
in an hour. But maybe that’s not enough, what if you
want to go faster? The Concorde 2 would be very close to going
beyond supersonic, and into an even faster category, known as hypersonic. When people talk about hypersonic speeds,
they’re generally talking about Mach 5 or higher -- more than five times the speed of
sound. Those speeds get their own category, because
that’s when the temperature of the plane becomes a bigger issue. The plane is flying through the air so quickly
that friction with particles in the air is a real problem, because it makes a lot of
heat. At hypersonic speeds, planes need to be able
to withstand temperatures over 1000 degrees celsius… but almost all of the more typical
metals would melt, or at least become very weak, at temperatures below that. The other challenge is the engine, because
a regular jet engine wouldn’t work. Standard, subsonic planes use large rotating
blades to compress incoming air, inject fuel, and then let it burn. Propelling them forward. At supersonic speeds, it becomes even easier,
because the high speeds already compress the air. In that case, the engine doesn’t even need
the blades -- that’s what’s known as a ramjet engine. Ram, because the air is just rammed into the
engine. At hypersonic speeds, though, this plan doesn’t
work as well. Sure, the air is compressed, but it’s moving
so fast that there’s not enough time for it to combust and actually help move the plane. So hypersonic planes need their own fuel and
their own oxygen -- which is what NASA used in the X-15, the first plane to reach hypersonic
speeds. It used a titanium skin to protect itself
from the extreme temperatures, and was able to fly at Mach 6.72. It also flew high enough that some of the
X-15 test flights are considered space flights. But the X-15 is not the kind of plane that
could be used commercially. For one thing, it burned through fuel so fast that it would
run out in less than two minutes. Also, pilots sometimes experienced 8 times
the force of Earth’s gravity, and most people wouldn’t consider that a comfortable business
trip. So, until engines became more efficient and
practical, commercial hypersonic planes are a long way from reality. And the scramjet
might be the answer. Scramjet engines work kind of like ramjets
do, but they’re designed to handle the faster-moving air. In testing, NASA’s found that they could
work at speeds up to Mach 15, at least in theory. There’s one big drawback, though: scramjet
engines only work at hypersonic speeds. The X-43A, for example, an unmanned test plane
that uses a scramjet, has to be accelerated above Mach 5 before it can fly on its own. It’s strapped to a booster rocket, which
is then loaded onto a subsonic plane. Alright, stay with me... The plane flies up to about 6 kilometers above
the ground, then releases the X-43A, along with the rocket, which gets to about 30 kilometers
up and to speeds of Mach 5. Then the X-43A can start its flight. So, it might be a while before hypersonic
planes are a practical way to get across the Atlantic. But a future where a trip to the other side
of the world involves flying faster than the speed of sound, without painful sonic booms
for the people on the ground? That might not be so far off. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
How high can you count on your fingers? It seems like a question 
with an obvious answer. After all, most of us have ten fingers, or to be more precise, eight fingers and two thumbs. This gives us a total of ten digits
on our two hands, which we use to count to ten. It's no coincidence that the ten symbols
we use in our modern numbering system are called digits as well. But that's not the only way to count. In some places, it's customary to
go up to twelve on just one hand. How? Well, each finger is divided 
into three sections, and we have a natural pointer
to indicate each one, the thumb. That gives us an easy to way to count
to twelve on one hand. And if we want to count higher, we can use the digits on our other hand to
keep track of each time we get to twelve, up to five groups of twelve, or 60. Better yet, let's use the sections
on the second hand to count twelve groups of twelve,
up to 144. That's a pretty big improvement, but we can go higher by finding more
countable parts on each hand. For example, each finger 
has three sections and three creases for a total of six things to count. Now we're up to 24 on each hand, and using our other hand to mark
groups of 24 gets us all the way to 576. Can we go any higher? It looks like we've reached the limit
of how many different finger parts we can count with any precision. So let's think of something different. One of our greatest 
mathematical inventions is the system of positional notation, where the placement of symbols allows
for different magnitudes of value, as in the number 999. Even though the same symbol is used
three times, each position indicates a different
order of magnitude. So we can use positional value on
our fingers to beat our previous record. Let's forget about finger sections
for a moment and look at the simplest case of having
just two options per finger, up and down. This won't allow us to represent 
powers of ten, but it's perfect for the counting system
that uses powers of two, otherwise known as binary. In binary, each position has double
the value of the previous one, so we can assign 
our fingers values of one, two, four, eight, all the way up to 512. And any positive integer,
up to a certain limit, can be expressed 
as a sum of these numbers. For example, the number seven
is 4+2+1. so we can represent it by having
just these three fingers raised. Meanwhile, 250 is 128+64+32+16+8+2. How high an we go now? That would be the number with all ten
fingers raised, or 1,023. Is it possible to go even higher? It depends on how dexterous you feel. If you can bend each finger just halfway,
that gives us three different states - down, half bent, and raised. Now, we can count using 
a base-three positional system, up to 59,048. And if you can bend your fingers
into four different states or more, you can get even higher. That limit is up to you,
and your own flexibility and ingenuity. Even with our fingers in just two
possible states, we're already working pretty efficiently. In fact, our computers are based
on the same principle. Each microchip consists of tiny
electrical switches that can be either on or off, meaning that base-two is the default way
they represent numbers. And just as we can use this system to
count past 1,000 using only our fingers, computers can perform billions 
of operations just by counting off 1's and 0's.

**Transcript**:
How high can you count on your fingers? It seems like a question 
with an obvious answer. After all, most of us have ten fingers, or to be more precise, eight fingers and two thumbs. This gives us a total of ten digits
on our two hands, which we use to count to ten. It's no coincidence that the ten symbols
we use in our modern numbering system are called digits as well. But that's not the only way to count. In some places, it's customary to
go up to twelve on just one hand. How? Well, each finger is divided 
into three sections, and we have a natural pointer
to indicate each one, the thumb. That gives us an easy to way to count
to twelve on one hand. And if we want to count higher, we can use the digits on our other hand to
keep track of each time we get to twelve, up to five groups of twelve, or 60. Better yet, let's use the sections
on the second hand to count twelve groups of twelve,
up to 144. That's a pretty big improvement, but we can go higher by finding more
countable parts on each hand. For example, each finger 
has three sections and three creases for a total of six things to count. Now we're up to 24 on each hand, and using our other hand to mark
groups of 24 gets us all the way to 576. Can we go any higher? It looks like we've reached the limit
of how many different finger parts we can count with any precision. So let's think of something different. One of our greatest 
mathematical inventions is the system of positional notation, where the placement of symbols allows
for different magnitudes of value, as in the number 999. Even though the same symbol is used
three times, each position indicates a different
order of magnitude. So we can use positional value on
our fingers to beat our previous record. Let's forget about finger sections
for a moment and look at the simplest case of having
just two options per finger, up and down. This won't allow us to represent 
powers of ten, but it's perfect for the counting system
that uses powers of two, otherwise known as binary. In binary, each position has double
the value of the previous one, so we can assign 
our fingers values of one, two, four, eight, all the way up to 512. And any positive integer,
up to a certain limit, can be expressed 
as a sum of these numbers. For example, the number seven
is 4+2+1. so we can represent it by having
just these three fingers raised. Meanwhile, 250 is 128+64+32+16+8+2. How high an we go now? That would be the number with all ten
fingers raised, or 1,023. Is it possible to go even higher? It depends on how dexterous you feel. If you can bend each finger just halfway,
that gives us three different states - down, half bent, and raised. Now, we can count using 
a base-three positional system, up to 59,048. And if you can bend your fingers
into four different states or more, you can get even higher. That limit is up to you,
and your own flexibility and ingenuity. Even with our fingers in just two
possible states, we're already working pretty efficiently. In fact, our computers are based
on the same principle. Each microchip consists of tiny
electrical switches that can be either on or off, meaning that base-two is the default way
they represent numbers. And just as we can use this system to
count past 1,000 using only our fingers, computers can perform billions 
of operations just by counting off 1's and 0's.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the powers of two and whether any of these numbers begin with a seven. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, which is about the counting system that uses powers of two. Although the question intent and options are not identical, they are related to the same topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar in terms of question intent, I would choose Question 7, which is about the maximum number you can represent using binary on your fingers. This question is related to the powers of two, and the options are similar in terms of the magnitude of the numbers.

But since neither Question 6 nor Question 7 is a good match, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6 or Question 7, but with a low confidence level.

Index: 6 or 7 (with low confidence)

If I want to turn this globe into a flat map, I’m going to have to cut it open. In order to get this to look anything like a rectangle. I've had to cut it in places. I've had to stretch it so that the countries look all wonky. And even still, it's almost impossible to get it to lie flat. And that right there is the eternal dilemma
of map makers: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form
of distortion. This guy proved that with math a long time
ago. Since around 1500s, mathematicians have set
about creating algorithms that would translate the globe into something flat. To do this, they use a process called projection. Popular rectangular maps use a cylindrical
projections. Imagine putting a theoretical cylinder over
the globe and projecting each point of the sphere onto the cylinder’s surface. Unroll the cylinder, and you have a flat,
rectangular map. But you could also project the globe onto
other objects, and how exactly a map maker projects the globe will affect what the map
looks like once it’s all flattened out. And here’s the big problem: Every one of
these projections comes with trade offs in shape, distance, direction and land area. Certain map projections can be either misleading
or very helpful depending on what you are using them for. Here’s an example. This map is called the Mercator projection. If you’re American, you probably studied
it in school. It’s the projection Google Maps uses. Mercator projection is popular for a couple
of reasons. First, it generally preserves the shape of
the countries. Brazil on the globe has the same shape as
Brazil on the Mercator projection. But the real purpose of the Mercator projection
was navigation -- it preserves direction, which is a big deal if you are trying to navigate
the ocean with only a compass. It was designed so that a line drawn between
two points on the map would provide the exact angle to follow on a compass to travel between
those points. If we go back into a globe, you can see that
this line is not shortest route. But it provides a simple, reliable way to
navigate across oceans. Gerardus Mercator, who created the projection
in the 16th century, was able to preserve direction by varying the distance between
latitude lines while also making them straight, creating a grid of right angles.. But that created other problems. Where mercator fails is its representation
of size. Look at the size of Africa as compared to
Greenland. On the mercator map they look about the same
size. But look at a globe for Greenland’s true
size, and you’ll see it’s way smaller than Africa. By a factor of 14 in fact. If we put some dot that are all the same size
on a globe, then we projected as a mercator map, we would end up with this. The circles retain their shape but are enlarged
the closer you get the poles. One modern critique is that this distortion
perpetuates imperialist attitudes of European domination over the southern hemisphere "The Mercator projection has fostered imperialist attitudes for centuries and created a ethnic bias against the third world." "Really?" If you want to see a map that more accurately
displays size, you can use the Gall-Peters projection, which is called an equal-area
map. Look at Greenland and Africa. The size comparison is now accurate. Much better than the mercator. but it’s obvious that the country shapes
are now stretched. Here are the dots again so you can see how
the projection preserves area while totally distorting shape. Something happened in the late 60s that would
change the whole purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections. Satellites orbiting our planet started sending
location and navigation data to little receiver units all over the world. This global positioning system wiped out the
need for paper maps as a means of navigating both the seas and the sky. Map projection choices became less about navigational
imperatives and more about aesthetics, design, and presentation. The mercator map, that vital tool of pre-GPS
navigation, was shunned by cartographers who now saw it as misleading. But most web mapping tools like Google maps
still use the mercator. According to Google this is because the Mercator’s
ability to preserve shape and angles makes close-up views of cities more accurate -- a
90 degree left turn on the map is a 90degree left turn on the street you’re driving down. But when trying to display something on a
world map, cartographers rarely use the mercator. Most modern cartographers have settled on
a variety of non-rectangular projections that split the difference between totally distorting
either size or shape. In 1998 The National Geographic Society adopted
The Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape
accuracy. But the fact remains, that there is no one
right projection. cartographers and mathematicians have created
a huge library of available projections, each a new perspective on the planet. The best way to see what the earth really
looks like is to look at a globe. But as long we use flat maps, we will deal
with the tradeoffs of projections, Just remember: there’s no right answer.

**Transcript**:
If I want to turn this globe into a flat map, I’m going to have to cut it open. In order to get this to look anything like a rectangle. I've had to cut it in places. I've had to stretch it so that the countries look all wonky. And even still, it's almost impossible to get it to lie flat. And that right there is the eternal dilemma
of map makers: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form
of distortion. This guy proved that with math a long time
ago. Since around 1500s, mathematicians have set
about creating algorithms that would translate the globe into something flat. To do this, they use a process called projection. Popular rectangular maps use a cylindrical
projections. Imagine putting a theoretical cylinder over
the globe and projecting each point of the sphere onto the cylinder’s surface. Unroll the cylinder, and you have a flat,
rectangular map. But you could also project the globe onto
other objects, and how exactly a map maker projects the globe will affect what the map
looks like once it’s all flattened out. And here’s the big problem: Every one of
these projections comes with trade offs in shape, distance, direction and land area. Certain map projections can be either misleading
or very helpful depending on what you are using them for. Here’s an example. This map is called the Mercator projection. If you’re American, you probably studied
it in school. It’s the projection Google Maps uses. Mercator projection is popular for a couple
of reasons. First, it generally preserves the shape of
the countries. Brazil on the globe has the same shape as
Brazil on the Mercator projection. But the real purpose of the Mercator projection
was navigation -- it preserves direction, which is a big deal if you are trying to navigate
the ocean with only a compass. It was designed so that a line drawn between
two points on the map would provide the exact angle to follow on a compass to travel between
those points. If we go back into a globe, you can see that
this line is not shortest route. But it provides a simple, reliable way to
navigate across oceans. Gerardus Mercator, who created the projection
in the 16th century, was able to preserve direction by varying the distance between
latitude lines while also making them straight, creating a grid of right angles.. But that created other problems. Where mercator fails is its representation
of size. Look at the size of Africa as compared to
Greenland. On the mercator map they look about the same
size. But look at a globe for Greenland’s true
size, and you’ll see it’s way smaller than Africa. By a factor of 14 in fact. If we put some dot that are all the same size
on a globe, then we projected as a mercator map, we would end up with this. The circles retain their shape but are enlarged
the closer you get the poles. One modern critique is that this distortion
perpetuates imperialist attitudes of European domination over the southern hemisphere "The Mercator projection has fostered imperialist attitudes for centuries and created a ethnic bias against the third world." "Really?" If you want to see a map that more accurately
displays size, you can use the Gall-Peters projection, which is called an equal-area
map. Look at Greenland and Africa. The size comparison is now accurate. Much better than the mercator. but it’s obvious that the country shapes
are now stretched. Here are the dots again so you can see how
the projection preserves area while totally distorting shape. Something happened in the late 60s that would
change the whole purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections. Satellites orbiting our planet started sending
location and navigation data to little receiver units all over the world. This global positioning system wiped out the
need for paper maps as a means of navigating both the seas and the sky. Map projection choices became less about navigational
imperatives and more about aesthetics, design, and presentation. The mercator map, that vital tool of pre-GPS
navigation, was shunned by cartographers who now saw it as misleading. But most web mapping tools like Google maps
still use the mercator. According to Google this is because the Mercator’s
ability to preserve shape and angles makes close-up views of cities more accurate -- a
90 degree left turn on the map is a 90degree left turn on the street you’re driving down. But when trying to display something on a
world map, cartographers rarely use the mercator. Most modern cartographers have settled on
a variety of non-rectangular projections that split the difference between totally distorting
either size or shape. In 1998 The National Geographic Society adopted
The Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape
accuracy. But the fact remains, that there is no one
right projection. cartographers and mathematicians have created
a huge library of available projections, each a new perspective on the planet. The best way to see what the earth really
looks like is to look at a globe. But as long we use flat maps, we will deal
with the tradeoffs of projections, Just remember: there’s no right answer.

**Transcript**:
Nothing stuck to Mafia boss John Gotti who evaded justice for years by bribing
and threatening jurors and witnesses. That earned him the name
the Teflon Don after one of the slipperiest 
materials on Earth. Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo
crew wore for the moon landing, in pipes and valves used 
in the Manhattan Project, and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick
coating on frying pans and cookie sheets. So what is this slippery solid,
and why doesn't anything stick to it? Teflon is a brand name for
polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938
by a 27-year-old American chemist named Roy Plunkett while he was trying to develop 
a non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont, a chemicals company. The strange, white substance that formed
inside his lab canister was chemically inert, meaning it wouldn't react 
with other substances. It also had an extremely 
low coefficient of friction, making other materials slide right off it. Teflon's properties make it perfect
when you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof
of the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE
come from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of
repeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone 
of carbon atoms, each of which is attached 
to two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon
like armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine
is incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone
except each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces
that help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos
usually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached
to something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals 
to make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,
which acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret
guarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around 
800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into
a smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs
in this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein
molecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around 
without sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook
in a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,
like you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
it starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes
that can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast
over high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated 
well enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think 
that accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan
was bad for you, but the current consensus 
is that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other
chemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down
inside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon
is another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits 
worth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting
the environment for decades and exposing employees 
and local communities to health risks associated 
with a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved
in manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally 
convicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office
in New York City to announce, "The Teflon is gone. The don is covered in Velcro,
and all the charges stuck."

**Transcript**:
Nothing stuck to Mafia boss John Gotti who evaded justice for years by bribing
and threatening jurors and witnesses. That earned him the name
the Teflon Don after one of the slipperiest 
materials on Earth. Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo
crew wore for the moon landing, in pipes and valves used 
in the Manhattan Project, and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick
coating on frying pans and cookie sheets. So what is this slippery solid,
and why doesn't anything stick to it? Teflon is a brand name for
polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938
by a 27-year-old American chemist named Roy Plunkett while he was trying to develop 
a non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont, a chemicals company. The strange, white substance that formed
inside his lab canister was chemically inert, meaning it wouldn't react 
with other substances. It also had an extremely 
low coefficient of friction, making other materials slide right off it. Teflon's properties make it perfect
when you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof
of the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE
come from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of
repeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone 
of carbon atoms, each of which is attached 
to two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon
like armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine
is incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone
except each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces
that help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos
usually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached
to something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals 
to make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,
which acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret
guarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around 
800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into
a smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs
in this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein
molecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around 
without sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook
in a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,
like you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
it starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes
that can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast
over high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated 
well enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think 
that accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan
was bad for you, but the current consensus 
is that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other
chemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down
inside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon
is another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits 
worth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting
the environment for decades and exposing employees 
and local communities to health risks associated 
with a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved
in manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally 
convicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office
in New York City to announce, "The Teflon is gone. The don is covered in Velcro,
and all the charges stuck."

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 5: What is the molecular structure of Teflon, and how does it contribute to its properties?**

Although the question is not an exact match, the content and options of Question 5 are related to the molecular structure of Teflon and its properties, which is the main topic of the ground truth MCQ. The correct option of Question 5 (B) mentions the backbone of carbon atoms attached to two fluorine atoms, which is relevant to the ground truth MCQ's explanation of the spiral fashion of fluorine atoms around the carbon backbone.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **5**

**Transcript**:
Nothing stuck to Mafia boss John Gotti who evaded justice for years by bribing
and threatening jurors and witnesses. That earned him the name
the Teflon Don after one of the slipperiest 
materials on Earth. Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo
crew wore for the moon landing, in pipes and valves used 
in the Manhattan Project, and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick
coating on frying pans and cookie sheets. So what is this slippery solid,
and why doesn't anything stick to it? Teflon is a brand name for
polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938
by a 27-year-old American chemist named Roy Plunkett while he was trying to develop 
a non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont, a chemicals company. The strange, white substance that formed
inside his lab canister was chemically inert, meaning it wouldn't react 
with other substances. It also had an extremely 
low coefficient of friction, making other materials slide right off it. Teflon's properties make it perfect
when you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof
of the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE
come from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of
repeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone 
of carbon atoms, each of which is attached 
to two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon
like armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine
is incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone
except each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces
that help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos
usually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached
to something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals 
to make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,
which acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret
guarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around 
800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into
a smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs
in this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein
molecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around 
without sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook
in a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,
like you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
it starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes
that can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast
over high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated 
well enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think 
that accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan
was bad for you, but the current consensus 
is that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other
chemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down
inside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon
is another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits 
worth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting
the environment for decades and exposing employees 
and local communities to health risks associated 
with a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved
in manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally 
convicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office
in New York City to announce, "The Teflon is gone. The don is covered in Velcro,
and all the charges stuck."

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] This episode is supported by Prudential [MUSIC] With more than 7 billion people on Earth and
one car for every six of us, traffic is bad just about everywhere. [HONKING] Last year, American drivers wasted nearly a million collective years staring at each
other’s tail-lights. The average driver in London has it the worst,
spending more than four days a year in gridlock. "There's Big Ben, kids! Parliament!" But Earth is home to another great commuter,
whose populations number in the trillions, and they don’t get stuck in traffic. An army ant’s day is a lot like ours. Set off in the morning alongside thousands
of our neighbors, moving out and back in neat little lines so we can provide for our brood… I mean family. Crowding, bottlenecks, slowpokes, ants face
the same traffic challenges we do. But they don’t get in traffic jams, which
is why scientists are looking to them for solutions to human traffic. In a perfect world cars could pack in bumper
to bumper and drive at that magic speed, but we’re not perfect. One wrong tap on the gas or brakes, and OH
COME ON! GET MOVING! When speed and density hit a tipping point,
jams are inevitable. Yet in the ant world, traffic jams don’t
happen, even when things get crowded. The easiest solution to an overcrowded road
is to make it bigger. But ants can’t just cut trails as wide as
they want. Wider roads take time and energy to maintain,
and the pheromones that mark them become weaker. Instead, ants get organized. It might not look like it, but there’s lanes
here. Ants headed back to the colony loaded up with
food use the center lane, while outbound ants stay to the edges. Why three lanes and not two, like our roads? When two ants are on a collision course, eventually
one’s gotta give. The loaded inbound ants are less maneuverable,
so the empty-handed ant almost always turns first, half the time to either side. And voila: three lanes, no crashes, no traffic
jams. If you think you’re so different from an
army ant, pay attention next time you’re in a busy crosswalk. We naturally form similar lanes in crowds,
mindless individuals contributing to a larger pattern. But put us behind the wheel, and this happens. [HONKING] There’s a simple reason we hate traffic. Because we hate waiting in line. Queueing up plays weird tricks on our brains’
sense of time. Occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied
time. This is why people listen to the radio, or
play that license plate game. And it’s the same reason supermarkets put
magazines in the checkout lines. Ever been late for a big meeting and felt
like the universe is standing in your way? Anxiety makes waits seem longer. Ever been in a traffic jam with no obvious
cause? The worst. Uncertain or unexplained waits are longer
than known or explained waits. But traffic engineers have learned that simple
information signs can change how we experience delays. But more than anything else, we hate unfair
waits. You see a sign that says “lane closed ahead”,
so you get over with plenty of time to spare, only to see some jerk zip past you and get
over at the last second. What… you can’t wait like the rest of
us, Mr. Hurrypants? Quick side note. Gonna let you in on a little secret. Traffic researchers have found that late merging
is actually better. If everyone drives up to the bottleneck and
goes one-by-one like a zipper, traffic moves up to 15% faster. We use both lanes at max capacity, no one
gets cheated, everyone wins! The more you know. And where were we? Oh yeah. Our innate sense of “what’s fair” leads
to the biggest psychological illusion that we experience on the road. Why does traffic always move faster in the
other lane? Well, spoilers first: It doesn’t. Let’s say two cars enter your standard stop-and-go
traffic jam side by side. Let’s count the time each one spends passing
versus getting passed. One driver zips past a few cars in the other
lane, only to stop and wait and watch other cars pass. And then go! WOO HOO! And then wait. Even if the two cars cross some invisible
finish line together, the same way they started, each driver will feel like they spent more
time being passed than passing, because they did. Our brains pay more attention to the losses
than the gains. All of this points to the real problem with
traffic. Our ego. Human drivers care about minimizing their
travel time and don’t give two honks about what other drivers want. Driving slower may be faster for everyone
else, but it’s not faster for me! I don’t care if we all get where we’re
going at the same time, I don’t like being passed! When leaf-cutter ants get stuck on a twig
behind a heavily-loaded slowpoke, do they honk and yell bad ant words? No! They simply slow down and march behind the
ant returning with the goods, because that’s what’s best for the group. Worker ants are all related and working toward
the same goal, the good of the colony. That’s the cooperative genetic programming
that underlies their awesome traffic systems. The fact that we have big, complicated brains
is the very reason that we get stuck in traffic and ants don’t. We think of traffic as something that happens
to us rather than admitting we are the problem. Ants are essentially tiny machines with simple
programming. Put them on a trail with a few rules, allow
individuals to communicate and interact with each other, and voila, you’ve got complex
traffic networks running at near-maximum efficiency. Sound familiar? It should! That’s basically what we’ll get when we
stop letting our egos drive and put traffic in the hands of a network of self-driving
cars optimized to serve the collective good. Sure, sentient machines may enslave humanity,
but at least they’ll cut down on our commute! But that’s a video for another day. Stay curious. Thanks to Prudential for sponsoring this episode. Saving a little more today, even just one
percent more of your annual income, can go a long way toward building a better retirement
tomorrow. Let's do a math equation. Say a 25 year-old that earns $40,000 a year
is planning on retiring at 70. if they save an additional 1% of their salary by deducting
$33 from their monthly paycheck and earn 6% compounding interest, they could increase
their retirement savings by about $97,944. You can go to RaceForRetirement.com for more

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks why wider roads are less efficient for ants. The correct answer is that they take more energy to maintain and the pheromones that mark the trail become weaker.

Generated MCQ 2 is somewhat related to this topic, as it asks how army ants avoid traffic jams, even in crowded conditions. However, it does not directly address the issue of wider roads.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that asks about the limitations or drawbacks of wider roads for ants. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Generated MCQ 2, but with the caveat that it is not a direct match.

any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because 
we're so used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually
a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination
inside your brain. That's because to create 
these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces 
and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made 
from fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands
of electrical signals getting them all to their destination
at precisely the right time. When you look at an object, thousands of neurons 
in your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode various 
characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow. This synchronous firing strengthens the
connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known
as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called
the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up,
assembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different
neuronal ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble 
associated with it, the neurons wired together
by that synchronized firing. But this principle doesn't explain
the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations
without ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin
balancing a pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, 
called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles 
for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects
as a single image. But something in your brain 
has to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate 
is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in 
all complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected
to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions
called neural fibers. The mental synthesis theory proposes
that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send
electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles
in the posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on
at the same time, you experience the composite image
just as if you'd actually seen it. This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles
by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis. In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both
neuronal ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away 
from the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers
at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length 
of the connections, but your brain, 
especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change 
the conduction velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty
substance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals 
zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have 
as many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 
100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this
difference in myelination could be the key 
to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, 
to our mental synthesis ability. A lot of this myelination 
happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot
to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies
throughout our lives.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the characteristics of a neuronal ensemble, specifically which statement is untrue. The generated MCQs do not directly ask about neuronal ensembles, but some questions touch on related concepts.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 3, which asks about the activation of multiple neuronal ensembles according to the Mental Synthesis Theory. Although it does not directly ask about the characteristics of a neuronal ensemble, it is related to the concept of neuronal ensembles and their activation.

However, a closer examination of the generated MCQs reveals that Question 5 is also related to the concept of neuronal ensembles, as it asks about mental synthesis, which involves the coordination of multiple neuronal ensembles.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 5 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent and content. However, it is essential to note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically asks about the characteristics of a neuronal ensemble.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 4. 

The ground truth MCQ asks about the tasks in which a lobotomy patient would show a deficit. A lobotomy is a surgical procedure that involves severing or scraping away parts of the brain, often including the prefrontal cortex. The correct answer, "Playing chess", requires complex cognitive functions, which are associated with the prefrontal cortex.

Question 4 asks about the part of the brain involved in coordinating the activation of multiple neuronal ensembles, and the correct answer is the prefrontal cortex. Although the questions are not identical, they both relate to the function of the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in complex cognitive tasks.

**Transcript**:
Imagine, for a second,
a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit 
around a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple. You probably haven't actually seen
any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because 
we're so used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually
a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination
inside your brain. That's because to create 
these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces 
and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made 
from fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands
of electrical signals getting them all to their destination
at precisely the right time. When you look at an object, thousands of neurons 
in your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode various 
characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow. This synchronous firing strengthens the
connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known
as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called
the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up,
assembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different
neuronal ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble 
associated with it, the neurons wired together
by that synchronized firing. But this principle doesn't explain
the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations
without ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin
balancing a pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, 
called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles 
for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects
as a single image. But something in your brain 
has to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate 
is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in 
all complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected
to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions
called neural fibers. The mental synthesis theory proposes
that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send
electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles
in the posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on
at the same time, you experience the composite image
just as if you'd actually seen it. This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles
by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis. In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both
neuronal ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away 
from the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers
at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length 
of the connections, but your brain, 
especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change 
the conduction velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty
substance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals 
zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have 
as many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 
100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this
difference in myelination could be the key 
to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, 
to our mental synthesis ability. A lot of this myelination 
happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot
to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies
throughout our lives.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 5: What is mental synthesis?**

Although the options in Question 5 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are closely related. Mental synthesis is defined in the transcript as the conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the prefrontal cortex, which is also the concept being tested in the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even more similar question is **Question 3: According to the Mental Synthesis Theory, what is necessary for the brain to conjure up an image of something that has never been seen before?**

This question is more similar because it specifically mentions the Mental Synthesis Theory, which is the concept being tested in the ground truth MCQ. The options in Question 3 also relate to the activation of neuronal ensembles, which is a key aspect of mental synthesis.

But the most similar question is actually not among the first 9 questions, the most similar is **Question 10 is not the best match**.

Since none of the questions ask which activity involves mental synthesis the best match would be the one that when modified would ask the same thing as the ground truth MCQ.

Upon re-reading all generated MCQs I noticed that question 3 is the most similar but it would need to be modified, another option that is the best match would be question 5 if it is modified to include "which activity" instead of "what is".

However, if I had to choose one of the generated MCQs as the most similar, without modification I would choose:

**None**, but if I really had to pick one I would say **Question 3**

**Transcript**:
Why do humans drink so much milk? And given that all mammals lactate, why do we favor certain types of milk
over others? Milk is the first thing we drink, and thanks to developments in the
production and variety of dairy products, it can take on countless forms
for our dietary and sensory well-being. Milk's primary function is as a complete
source of nutrition for newborns. In fact, since it has all of the vital
nutrients for development and growth— proteins, carbohydrates, fats,
vitamins and minerals, and water— milk is the only thing a baby
even needs to ingest for the first six months of life. The unique makeup of milk can vary
depending on factors like species, diet, and location. Reindeer of the Arctic Circle,
for example, make energy-dense milk
that's about 20% fat, roughly five times more than human
or cow's milk, to help their young survive
the harsh, freezing climate. So how is milk made? In the uniquely mammalian process
of lactation, a special class of milk-secreting cells
known as mammocytes line up in a single layer
around pear-shaped alveoli. Those cells absorb all of the building
blocks of milk, then synthesize tiny droplets of fat on structures called
smooth endoplasmic reticula. The droplets combine with each other
and other molecules and are then expelled and stored
in spaces between cells. Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk
through the breasts, udders, or, in the rare case of the platypus,
through ducts in the abdomen. Although this process is typically
reserved for females, in some species, like dayak fruit bats,
goats, and even cats, males can also lactate. Milk drinkers worldwide consume
dairy from buffalo, goats, sheeps, camels, yaks, horses, and cows. Almost all of these species are ruminants, a type of mammal with
four-chambered stomachs that yield large quantities of milk. Of these, cows were the most
easily domesticated and produce a milk that is both
easily separated into cream and liquid and has a similar fat content
to human milk. In their natural environment, mammals secrete milk on call
for immediate consumption by their young. But with the demands of thirsty consumers, the dairy industry has enlisted methods
to step up production, enhance shelf life,
and provide a variety of milk products. In the dairy, centrifugation machines
spin milk at high speeds, forcing less dense fats to separate
from the liquid and float up. After being skimmed off, this fat, known as butterfat,
can be used in dairy products like butter, cream, and cheese. Or it can be later added back
to the liquid in varying proportions to yield different fat content milks. Full fat milk, sometimes referred
to as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added compared to 1 to 2%
for low and reduced fat milk, and less than half a percent
for skim milk. To stop reseparation of the fat
from the water, or creaming, the mixture undergoes the high-energy
pressurized process of homogenization. Before milk hits the shelves,
it’s also typically heat treated to reduce its level of microbes— a government-sanctioned process that raw milk enthusiasts argue
may reduce milk's nutritional worth. Milk spoilage is started by microbes, which consume and break
down the nutrients in milk. That process causes butterfat
to clump together, leading to a visually unpleasant product. And the byproducts of
the microbes' consumption are compounds that taste
and smell nasty. But there's a bigger problem. Raw milk can carry microbes that are
the sources of deadly diseases, so in order to kill as many of those
microbes as possible, and keep milk fresh longer, we use a technique called pasteurization. One version of this process involves
exposing milk to about 30 seconds of high heat. Another version,
called ultra-high temperature processing, or ultra pasteurization, blasts the milk with considerably higher
temperatures over just a few seconds. UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life, up to twelve months unrefrigerated, compared to pasteurized milk's
two weeks in the fridge. That's because the higher temperatures
of UHT processing inactivate far more microbes. Yet the higher processing temperatures may adversely affect the nutritional
and sensory properties of the milk. Ultimately, that choice lies
in the consumer's taste and need for convenience. Fortunately, there are many
choices available in an industry that produces in excess
of 840 million tons of products each year.

**Transcript**:
Why do humans drink so much milk? And given that all mammals lactate, why do we favor certain types of milk
over others? Milk is the first thing we drink, and thanks to developments in the
production and variety of dairy products, it can take on countless forms
for our dietary and sensory well-being. Milk's primary function is as a complete
source of nutrition for newborns. In fact, since it has all of the vital
nutrients for development and growth— proteins, carbohydrates, fats,
vitamins and minerals, and water— milk is the only thing a baby
even needs to ingest for the first six months of life. The unique makeup of milk can vary
depending on factors like species, diet, and location. Reindeer of the Arctic Circle,
for example, make energy-dense milk
that's about 20% fat, roughly five times more than human
or cow's milk, to help their young survive
the harsh, freezing climate. So how is milk made? In the uniquely mammalian process
of lactation, a special class of milk-secreting cells
known as mammocytes line up in a single layer
around pear-shaped alveoli. Those cells absorb all of the building
blocks of milk, then synthesize tiny droplets of fat on structures called
smooth endoplasmic reticula. The droplets combine with each other
and other molecules and are then expelled and stored
in spaces between cells. Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk
through the breasts, udders, or, in the rare case of the platypus,
through ducts in the abdomen. Although this process is typically
reserved for females, in some species, like dayak fruit bats,
goats, and even cats, males can also lactate. Milk drinkers worldwide consume
dairy from buffalo, goats, sheeps, camels, yaks, horses, and cows. Almost all of these species are ruminants, a type of mammal with
four-chambered stomachs that yield large quantities of milk. Of these, cows were the most
easily domesticated and produce a milk that is both
easily separated into cream and liquid and has a similar fat content
to human milk. In their natural environment, mammals secrete milk on call
for immediate consumption by their young. But with the demands of thirsty consumers, the dairy industry has enlisted methods
to step up production, enhance shelf life,
and provide a variety of milk products. In the dairy, centrifugation machines
spin milk at high speeds, forcing less dense fats to separate
from the liquid and float up. After being skimmed off, this fat, known as butterfat,
can be used in dairy products like butter, cream, and cheese. Or it can be later added back
to the liquid in varying proportions to yield different fat content milks. Full fat milk, sometimes referred
to as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added compared to 1 to 2%
for low and reduced fat milk, and less than half a percent
for skim milk. To stop reseparation of the fat
from the water, or creaming, the mixture undergoes the high-energy
pressurized process of homogenization. Before milk hits the shelves,
it’s also typically heat treated to reduce its level of microbes— a government-sanctioned process that raw milk enthusiasts argue
may reduce milk's nutritional worth. Milk spoilage is started by microbes, which consume and break
down the nutrients in milk. That process causes butterfat
to clump together, leading to a visually unpleasant product. And the byproducts of
the microbes' consumption are compounds that taste
and smell nasty. But there's a bigger problem. Raw milk can carry microbes that are
the sources of deadly diseases, so in order to kill as many of those
microbes as possible, and keep milk fresh longer, we use a technique called pasteurization. One version of this process involves
exposing milk to about 30 seconds of high heat. Another version,
called ultra-high temperature processing, or ultra pasteurization, blasts the milk with considerably higher
temperatures over just a few seconds. UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life, up to twelve months unrefrigerated, compared to pasteurized milk's
two weeks in the fridge. That's because the higher temperatures
of UHT processing inactivate far more microbes. Yet the higher processing temperatures may adversely affect the nutritional
and sensory properties of the milk. Ultimately, that choice lies
in the consumer's taste and need for convenience. Fortunately, there are many
choices available in an industry that produces in excess
of 840 million tons of products each year.

**Transcript**:
If you're ever walking down the street and come across an oddly stretched out
image, like this, you'll have an opportunity
to see something remarkable, but only if you stand in exactly
the right spot. That happens because these works
employ a technique called anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a special case
of perspective art, where artists represent realistic
three-dimensional views on two-dimensional surfaces. Though it's common today, this kind of perspective drawing has only
been around since the Italian Renaissance. Ancient art often showed all figures
on the same plane, varying in size by symbolic importance. Classical Greek and Roman artists realized
they could make objects seem further by drawing them smaller, but many early attempts at perspective
were inconsistent or incorrect. In 15th century Florence, artists realized the illusion 
of perspective could be achieved with higher degrees
of sophistication by applying mathematical principles. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci 
manipulated the mathematics to create the first known 
anamorphic drawing. A number of other artists later
picked up the technique, including Hans Holbein 
in "The Ambassadors." This painting features a distorted
shape that forms into a skull as the viewer approaches from the side. In order to understand how artists
achieve that effect, we first have to understand how 
perspective drawings work in general. Imagine looking out a window. Light bounces off objects 
and into your eye, intersecting the window along the way. Now, imagine you could paint the image
you see directly onto the window while standing still and keeping
only one eye open. The result would be nearly
indistinguishable from the actual view with your brain adding depth
to the 2-D picture, but only from that one spot. Standing even just a bit off
to the side would make the drawing 
lose its 3-D effect. Artists understand that 
a perspective drawing is just a projection
onto a 2-D plane. This allows them to use math to come up
with basic rules of perspective that allow them to draw without a window. One is that parallel lines, like these, can only be drawn as parallel if they're
parallel to the plane of the canvas. Otherwise, they need to be drawn
converging to a common point known as the vanishing point. So that's a standard perspective drawing. With an anamorphic drawing,
like "The Ambassadors," directly facing the canvas makes the image
look stretched and distorted, but put your eye in exactly the right spot
way off to the side, and the skull materializes. Going back to the window analogy, it's as if the artist painted 
onto a window positioned at an angle instead of straight on, though that's not how Renaissance artists
actually created anamorphic drawings. Typically, they draw a normal image 
onto one surface, then use a light, a grid, or even strings to project it
onto a canvas at an angle. Now let's say you want to make
an anamorphic sidewalk drawing. In this case, you want to create
the illusion that a 3-D image has been added
seamlessly into an existing scene. You can first put a window
in front of the sidewalk and draw what you want to add 
onto the window. It should be in the same perspective
as the rest of the scene, which might require the use of those
basic rules of perspective. Once the drawing's complete, you can use a projector placed 
where your eye was to project your drawing down 
onto the sidewalk, then chalk over it. The sidewalk drawing 
and the drawing on the window will be nearly indistinguishable
from that point of view, so viewers' brains will again be tricked into believing that the drawing
on the ground is three-dimensional. And you don't have to project onto
a flat surface to create this illusion. You can project onto multiple surfaces, or assemble a jumble of objects,
that from the right point of view, appears to be something else entirely. All over the planet, you can find
solid surfaces giving way to strange, wonderful,
or terrifying visions. From your sidewalk 
to your computer screen, these are just some of the ways
that math and perspective can open up whole new worlds.

**Transcript**:
If you're ever walking down the street and come across an oddly stretched out
image, like this, you'll have an opportunity
to see something remarkable, but only if you stand in exactly
the right spot. That happens because these works
employ a technique called anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a special case
of perspective art, where artists represent realistic
three-dimensional views on two-dimensional surfaces. Though it's common today, this kind of perspective drawing has only
been around since the Italian Renaissance. Ancient art often showed all figures
on the same plane, varying in size by symbolic importance. Classical Greek and Roman artists realized
they could make objects seem further by drawing them smaller, but many early attempts at perspective
were inconsistent or incorrect. In 15th century Florence, artists realized the illusion 
of perspective could be achieved with higher degrees
of sophistication by applying mathematical principles. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci 
manipulated the mathematics to create the first known 
anamorphic drawing. A number of other artists later
picked up the technique, including Hans Holbein 
in "The Ambassadors." This painting features a distorted
shape that forms into a skull as the viewer approaches from the side. In order to understand how artists
achieve that effect, we first have to understand how 
perspective drawings work in general. Imagine looking out a window. Light bounces off objects 
and into your eye, intersecting the window along the way. Now, imagine you could paint the image
you see directly onto the window while standing still and keeping
only one eye open. The result would be nearly
indistinguishable from the actual view with your brain adding depth
to the 2-D picture, but only from that one spot. Standing even just a bit off
to the side would make the drawing 
lose its 3-D effect. Artists understand that 
a perspective drawing is just a projection
onto a 2-D plane. This allows them to use math to come up
with basic rules of perspective that allow them to draw without a window. One is that parallel lines, like these, can only be drawn as parallel if they're
parallel to the plane of the canvas. Otherwise, they need to be drawn
converging to a common point known as the vanishing point. So that's a standard perspective drawing. With an anamorphic drawing,
like "The Ambassadors," directly facing the canvas makes the image
look stretched and distorted, but put your eye in exactly the right spot
way off to the side, and the skull materializes. Going back to the window analogy, it's as if the artist painted 
onto a window positioned at an angle instead of straight on, though that's not how Renaissance artists
actually created anamorphic drawings. Typically, they draw a normal image 
onto one surface, then use a light, a grid, or even strings to project it
onto a canvas at an angle. Now let's say you want to make
an anamorphic sidewalk drawing. In this case, you want to create
the illusion that a 3-D image has been added
seamlessly into an existing scene. You can first put a window
in front of the sidewalk and draw what you want to add 
onto the window. It should be in the same perspective
as the rest of the scene, which might require the use of those
basic rules of perspective. Once the drawing's complete, you can use a projector placed 
where your eye was to project your drawing down 
onto the sidewalk, then chalk over it. The sidewalk drawing 
and the drawing on the window will be nearly indistinguishable
from that point of view, so viewers' brains will again be tricked into believing that the drawing
on the ground is three-dimensional. And you don't have to project onto
a flat surface to create this illusion. You can project onto multiple surfaces, or assemble a jumble of objects,
that from the right point of view, appears to be something else entirely. All over the planet, you can find
solid surfaces giving way to strange, wonderful,
or terrifying visions. From your sidewalk 
to your computer screen, these are just some of the ways
that math and perspective can open up whole new worlds.

**Transcript**:
There's a lot of buzz in the news about de-extinction. With the growing interest in technologies and research, that could possibly bring animals and plants back from being, well, extinct. One of the candidates high on that list is the woolly mammoth. They're the closest relatives to our living Asian elephants today, and only widely disappeared about 10,000 years ago. With some isolated populations hanging on until about 4,700 years ago. That may seem like a long time, but at that period in the not-so-distant past, glass was being invented and the great pyramids of Giza were being built. So, really, it's a blip in the scheme of things. Since woolly mammoth's genetic information has been so well preserved in the permafrost, where recent specimens have been discovered, scientists have been able to sequence their genomes and now different groups are trying to figure out a way to insert mammoth genes into living elephant cells and maybe, in a way, bring them back. But my question is, why mammoths? Why not, say, mastodons? No, not the heavy metal group, the late miocene megafauna. Modern day elephants, mammoths and mastodons are all in the order proboscidea, along with other exinct tusked creatures, like palaeomastodons and gomphotheres. From the outside, mammoths and mastodons may look pretty similar, but they've been different for a very long time. About 25 million years. Mastodons were on Earth long before the mammoths, who showed up a little late to the Pleistocene party about 20 million years later. So you couldn't hope to have good luck splicing mastodon DNA into the Asian elephant genome. That's like putting human cells into a gibbon. It wouldn't work because the two are too genetically different. In addition to genetic differences between mammoths and mastodons, they're also morphologically different. This is most obviously seen in their teeth. Mammoths have large, flat, grinding surfaces on top of their molars, whereas mastodons have giant, mountain-like cusps. These cusps even inspired their scientific name, from the Greek word "masto" for "breast" and "odon" for "tooth." Literally breast tooth. The shape of their teeth gives us clues about their diets, too. Mammoths were grazers, like cows and elephants today and as such, they have flat grinding surfaces on their teeth for breaking down grasses. Mastodons were browsers, like goats. The bulbous cusps on their teeth were useful for breaking down sticks and shrubs. So, remember, mammoths: cows. Matsodons: breast-toothed goats. In addition to differences in their dentition, mastodons were shorter stockier than mammoths with smaller ears, but there were some exceptions. Mammoths and mastodons are in two different genera, Mammut and Mammuthus. There were four different mastodon species and ten different species of mammoth. You're probably most familiar with the woolly mammoth but there was also a pygmy species, the dwarf mammoth, which was about as tall as I am. This species was found on the Channel Islands off of California and its small size was most likely result of island dwarfism. This can happen when a large species gets isolated on an island, since smaller animals require fewer food resources, and in the absence of predators, small animals tend to breed more quickly than their larger counterparts. As to how they got to the island, how else? They swam! Elephants today are great long-distance swimmers with their built-in snorkels and buoyant mass. Smelling delicious grasses from mainland California, a group of Columbian mammoths departed the coast, swimming out into the ocean towards the smell. Fast forward 30,000 years and congratulations! Almost puppy sized mammoths. While there isn't yet a conclusive answer as to what caused the extinction for both mammoths and mastodons in the last 10,000 years, whether it was from over-hunting by humans or climate related changes, a few questions remain. If we can resurrect the mammoth genome, should we? And where would we put them?

It wouldn't work because the two are too genetically different. In addition to genetic differences between mammoths and mastodons, they're also morphologically different. This is most obviously seen in their teeth. Mammoths have large, flat, grinding surfaces on top of their molars, whereas mastodons have giant, mountain-like cusps. These cusps even inspired their scientific name, from the Greek word "masto" for "breast" and "odon" for "tooth." Literally breast tooth. The shape of their teeth gives us clues about their diets, too. Mammoths were grazers, like cows and elephants today and as such, they have flat grinding surfaces on their teeth for breaking down grasses. Mastodons were browsers, like goats. The bulbous cusps on their teeth were useful for breaking down sticks and shrubs. So, remember, mammoths: cows. Matsodons: breast-toothed goats. In addition to differences in their dentition, mastodons were shorter stockier than mammoths with smaller ears, but there were some exceptions. Mammoths and mastodons are in two different genera, Mammut and Mammuthus. There were four different mastodon species and ten different species of mammoth. You're probably most familiar with the woolly mammoth but there was also a pygmy species, the dwarf mammoth, which was about as tall as I am. This species was found on the Channel Islands off of California and its small size was most likely result of island dwarfism. This can happen when a large species gets isolated on an island, since smaller animals require fewer food resources, and in the absence of predators, small animals tend to breed more quickly than their larger counterparts. As to how they got to the island, how else? They swam! Elephants today are great long-distance swimmers with their built-in snorkels and buoyant mass. Smelling delicious grasses from mainland California, a group of Columbian mammoths departed the coast, swimming out into the ocean towards the smell. Fast forward 30,000 years and congratulations! Almost puppy sized mammoths. While there isn't yet a conclusive answer as to what caused the extinction for both mammoths and mastodons in the last 10,000 years, whether it was from over-hunting by humans or climate related changes, a few questions remain. If we can resurrect the mammoth genome, should we? And where would we put them?

**Transcript**:
There's a lot of buzz in the news about de-extinction. With the growing interest in technologies and research, that could possibly bring animals and plants back from being, well, extinct. One of the candidates high on that list is the woolly mammoth. They're the closest relatives to our living Asian elephants today, and only widely disappeared about 10,000 years ago. With some isolated populations hanging on until about 4,700 years ago. That may seem like a long time, but at that period in the not-so-distant past, glass was being invented and the great pyramids of Giza were being built. So, really, it's a blip in the scheme of things. Since woolly mammoth's genetic information has been so well preserved in the permafrost, where recent specimens have been discovered, scientists have been able to sequence their genomes and now different groups are trying to figure out a way to insert mammoth genes into living elephant cells and maybe, in a way, bring them back. But my question is, why mammoths? Why not, say, mastodons? No, not the heavy metal group, the late miocene megafauna. Modern day elephants, mammoths and mastodons are all in the order proboscidea, along with other exinct tusked creatures, like palaeomastodons and gomphotheres. From the outside, mammoths and mastodons may look pretty similar, but they've been different for a very long time. About 25 million years. Mastodons were on Earth long before the mammoths, who showed up a little late to the Pleistocene party about 20 million years later.

**Transcript**:
Why do skunks smell so bad? It all comes down to chemistry. By the way, this video will include slow motion
footage of skunk anuses. So, be warned. I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. There are a number of species of skunk in
the world, but the most iconic has to be the striped skunk. That’s the one that looks like Pepe Le Pew—it’s
all black, typically with one white line that usually splits into two on its back. And it can be found all over the United States
as well as northern Mexico and southern Canada. Its latin name is Mephitis mephitis, which
appropriately enough means something like foul stench or noxious vapor. Obviously, that’s because the most defining
character of skunks is their defensive spray, which can cause watery eyes, nausea, and leave
you smelling terrible. The chemical makeup of the spray is different
depending on the species, but all of them contain special types of compounds called
“thiols.” Thiols, also known as “mercaptans,” are
a type of chemical group made up of a sulfur and hydrogen atom bonded together. And they typically smell really strongly. There are actually three different thiols
in striped skunks spray, and two of those are the main contributors to the awful odor. But three other molecules in the spray are
what are called “thioacetates.” Those compounds don’t have a strong scent,
but they can easily become thiols when they’re exposed to water. And that might explain why a pet that gets
sprayed may start to smell skunky again after a bath. Now, skunk musk is produced by anal scent
glands—which actually, lots of mammals have, though most aren’t quite this exciting. When a skunk sprays, nipple-like protrusions
called papillae come out of the anus and squirt the musk at the target. The bad news is they can squirt a distance
of about 10 feet, and are uncannily good at hitting their mark. The good news is that skunks really don’t
want to spray unless they have to, and adults usually give warning signals beforehand. Striped skunks will hiss, stomp, and raise
their tails before spraying. And spotted skunks will even do a handstand. But, what should you do on the off-chance
that you wind up covered in musk? Well, definitely don’t use tomato juice—that’s
just a myth. Instead, use something that converts the thiol
into a different type of compound. Some scientists suggest using a mixture of
dilute hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a little liquid soap, which will oxidize the
thiol and turn it into a sulfonic acid. But be careful, because it could dye your
hair or pet fur. Anyway, despite their terrible reputation,
some skunks have actually been domesticated, and people say they make really cute and affectionate
pets. But if you do want a pet skunk, make sure
you know how to take care of it and get one from a breeder. Grabbing one from the woods is not at all
nice for the skunk. And it would probably let you know that by
squirting you with an anal gland full of noxious musk. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Why do skunks smell so bad? It all comes down to chemistry. By the way, this video will include slow motion
footage of skunk anuses. So, be warned. I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. There are a number of species of skunk in
the world, but the most iconic has to be the striped skunk. That’s the one that looks like Pepe Le Pew—it’s
all black, typically with one white line that usually splits into two on its back. And it can be found all over the United States
as well as northern Mexico and southern Canada. Its latin name is Mephitis mephitis, which
appropriately enough means something like foul stench or noxious vapor. Obviously, that’s because the most defining
character of skunks is their defensive spray, which can cause watery eyes, nausea, and leave
you smelling terrible. The chemical makeup of the spray is different
depending on the species, but all of them contain special types of compounds called
“thiols.” Thiols, also known as “mercaptans,” are
a type of chemical group made up of a sulfur and hydrogen atom bonded together. And they typically smell really strongly. There are actually three different thiols
in striped skunks spray, and two of those are the main contributors to the awful odor. But three other molecules in the spray are
what are called “thioacetates.” Those compounds don’t have a strong scent,
but they can easily become thiols when they’re exposed to water. And that might explain why a pet that gets
sprayed may start to smell skunky again after a bath. Now, skunk musk is produced by anal scent
glands—which actually, lots of mammals have, though most aren’t quite this exciting. When a skunk sprays, nipple-like protrusions
called papillae come out of the anus and squirt the musk at the target. The bad news is they can squirt a distance
of about 10 feet, and are uncannily good at hitting their mark. The good news is that skunks really don’t
want to spray unless they have to, and adults usually give warning signals beforehand. Striped skunks will hiss, stomp, and raise
their tails before spraying. And spotted skunks will even do a handstand. But, what should you do on the off-chance
that you wind up covered in musk? Well, definitely don’t use tomato juice—that’s
just a myth. Instead, use something that converts the thiol
into a different type of compound. Some scientists suggest using a mixture of
dilute hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a little liquid soap, which will oxidize the
thiol and turn it into a sulfonic acid. But be careful, because it could dye your
hair or pet fur. Anyway, despite their terrible reputation,
some skunks have actually been domesticated, and people say they make really cute and affectionate
pets. But if you do want a pet skunk, make sure
you know how to take care of it and get one from a breeder. Grabbing one from the woods is not at all
nice for the skunk. And it would probably let you know that by
squirting you with an anal gland full of noxious musk. Ew.

**Transcript**:
Pretty much as long as humans have looked
up at the night sky, we’ve been studying astronomy. In all this time, we’ve learned so much
about the universe beyond our Solar System, and have found lots of exoplanets orbiting
other stars. But there’s a lot that scientists still
don’t know. In fact, three relatively recent exoplanet
discoveries are completely baffling researchers because, according to what we know about astronomy,
they shouldn’t exist! The first of these planets is called Kepler-78b, which was discovered using data from NASA’s
Kepler space telescope, and orbits a star about 400 light years away
from Earth. Based on changes in its star’s light, astronomers
calculated that Kepler-78b’s radius is about 1.2 times the radius of Earth and it’s around 1.7 times as massive as
the Earth. This means it also has a similar density to
the Earth, so the researchers think its composition is
similar, too, with lots of rock and iron. But that’s where the similarities stop. Kepler-78b is about 100 times closer to its
star than the Earth is to the Sun, and its surface temperatures might even get
up to 3,100 Kelvin. Basically, it’s kind of like Earth … if
Earth was a blazing inferno. This planet’s super close orbit to its host
star means that a year only lasts 8.5 hours. And scientists don’t understand how Kepler-78b
even exists, because it doesn’t fit any of the current
theories of planetary formation it’s just too close to its star. See, when Kepler-78b was first forming from the gas and dust-filled protoplanetary
disk, its host star was even larger. So if the planet was orbiting where it is
now, it would’ve been inside its star, which
is... impossible. Another option is that it formed farther away
and migrated closer, but scientists think that’s pretty unlikely, since it probably would’ve kept going and
plummeted into the star. As of now, it’s a mystery. The main thing we do know about Kepler-78b is that it’ll probably only be around for
another three billion years or so. It’ll move closer and closer to its host
star, until the gravity eventually tears it apart. Our next mysterious planet is called Kepler-10c, which was also detected using data from the
Kepler space telescope, and is about 560 light years away from us. It’s radius isn’t all that special. It’s only about 2.3 times the radius of
the Earth. And initially, because of its size, scientists predicted that Kepler-10c would
have a thick, gaseous atmosphere, making it like a mini-Neptune. Instead, they found a planet with a mass that
might be between 14-17 times the Earth’s, which suggests that it’s a really dense
rocky planet without much of an atmosphere. A mass that large is basically unheard of
in a planet that size, which is why astronomers dubbed it a mega-Earth. Which, y’know, sounds pretty cool. Based on our current understanding of planets, one this massive without an atmosphere shouldn’t
even exist. Theoretically, it would’ve grabbed a bunch
of nearby lighter elements with its huge gravitational force as the star
system was forming, and turned into a gas giant like Jupiter. But it probably never even had an atmosphere, because if it did at some point, it would’ve
held onto it. So, right now, scientists are just left with
another giant rock in space that they can’t really explain. Last but not least, we have a gas giant named
HD 106906 b, which is 11 times as massive as Jupiter, and discovered using data from the Hubble
Space Telescope and the Magellan telescope in Chile. This planet orbits a really young star 300
light years away from Earth. The system is only 13 million years old. But that’s not what makes it weird. See, HD 106906 b orbits its star at a distance
of 650 astronomical units. That’s more than 20 times the average distance
between the Sun and Neptune. A planet that far away from its host star shouldn’t have had enough gaseous and rocky
materials to grow that huge, especially in such a relatively short period
of time. But, somehow, it exists. Some researchers think it might have formed inside the dust-filled debris disk surrounding
its host star, and got kicked out later, but they’re still
not sure. A recent study seems to support this idea, suggesting that the planet might have even
captured some of that dusty material, and might be surrounded by a ring or shroud. But that’s just one hypothesis and, until
astronomers get more data, the planet is still an enigma. These three planets are just a drop in the
bucket that is our universe, and we still have so much to learn. It’s really the strangest discoveries that
make astronomy so cool. Every time we start to think we understand
how certain things work, like planetary formation, amazing surprises
get thrown our way. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

Kepler space telescope, and is about 560 light years away from us. It’s radius isn’t all that special. It’s only about 2.3 times the radius of
the Earth. And initially, because of its size, scientists predicted that Kepler-10c would
have a thick, gaseous atmosphere, making it like a mini-Neptune. Instead, they found a planet with a mass that
might be between 14-17 times the Earth’s, which suggests that it’s a really dense
rocky planet without much of an atmosphere. A mass that large is basically unheard of
in a planet that size, which is why astronomers dubbed it a mega-Earth. Which, y’know, sounds pretty cool. Based on our current understanding of planets, one this massive without an atmosphere shouldn’t
even exist. Theoretically, it would’ve grabbed a bunch
of nearby lighter elements with its huge gravitational force as the star
system was forming, and turned into a gas giant like Jupiter. But it probably never even had an atmosphere, because if it did at some point, it would’ve
held onto it. So, right now, scientists are just left with
another giant rock in space that they can’t really explain. Last but not least, we have a gas giant named
HD 106906 b, which is 11 times as massive as Jupiter, and discovered using data from the Hubble
Space Telescope and the Magellan telescope in Chile. This planet orbits a really young star 300
light years away from Earth. The system is only 13 million years old. But that’s not what makes it weird. See, HD 106906 b orbits its star at a distance
of 650 astronomical units. That’s more than 20 times the average distance
between the Sun and Neptune. A planet that far away from its host star shouldn’t have had enough gaseous and rocky
materials to grow that huge, especially in such a relatively short period
of time. But, somehow, it exists. Some researchers think it might have formed inside the dust-filled debris disk surrounding
its host star, and got kicked out later, but they’re still
not sure. A recent study seems to support this idea, suggesting that the planet might have even
captured some of that dusty material, and might be surrounded by a ring or shroud. But that’s just one hypothesis and, until
astronomers get more data, the planet is still an enigma. These three planets are just a drop in the
bucket that is our universe, and we still have so much to learn. It’s really the strangest discoveries that
make astronomy so cool. Every time we start to think we understand
how certain things work, like planetary formation, amazing surprises

**Transcript**:
Pretty much as long as humans have looked
up at the night sky, we’ve been studying astronomy. In all this time, we’ve learned so much
about the universe beyond our Solar System, and have found lots of exoplanets orbiting
other stars. But there’s a lot that scientists still
don’t know. In fact, three relatively recent exoplanet
discoveries are completely baffling researchers because, according to what we know about astronomy,
they shouldn’t exist! The first of these planets is called Kepler-78b, which was discovered using data from NASA’s
Kepler space telescope, and orbits a star about 400 light years away
from Earth. Based on changes in its star’s light, astronomers
calculated that Kepler-78b’s radius is about 1.2 times the radius of Earth and it’s around 1.7 times as massive as
the Earth. This means it also has a similar density to
the Earth, so the researchers think its composition is
similar, too, with lots of rock and iron. But that’s where the similarities stop. Kepler-78b is about 100 times closer to its
star than the Earth is to the Sun, and its surface temperatures might even get
up to 3,100 Kelvin. Basically, it’s kind of like Earth … if
Earth was a blazing inferno. This planet’s super close orbit to its host
star means that a year only lasts 8.5 hours. And scientists don’t understand how Kepler-78b
even exists, because it doesn’t fit any of the current
theories of planetary formation it’s just too close to its star. See, when Kepler-78b was first forming from the gas and dust-filled protoplanetary
disk, its host star was even larger. So if the planet was orbiting where it is
now, it would’ve been inside its star, which
is... impossible. Another option is that it formed farther away
and migrated closer, but scientists think that’s pretty unlikely, since it probably would’ve kept going and
plummeted into the star. As of now, it’s a mystery. The main thing we do know about Kepler-78b is that it’ll probably only be around for
another three billion years or so. It’ll move closer and closer to its host
star, until the gravity eventually tears it apart. Our next mysterious planet is called Kepler-10c, which was also detected using data from the
Kepler space telescope, and is about 560 light years away from us. It’s radius isn’t all that special. It’s only about 2.3 times the radius of
the Earth. And initially, because of its size, scientists predicted that Kepler-10c would

**Transcript**:
What's so great about the Great Lakes? They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive
that they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water. That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be? The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins. Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between
these basins, and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes
by surface area. Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is
having a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being
degraded and increasingly populated, exposing the once pristine waters to industrial, urban,
and agricultural pollutants. Because less than 1% of the water
leaves the Lake's system annually, decades-old pollutants still lurk
in its waters. Humans have also inadvertently introduced more than 100 non-native
and invasive species into the lakes, such as zebra and quagga mussels,
and sea lampreys that have decimated some indigenous
fish populations. On a larger scale, climate change
is causing the waters to warm, thus reducing water levels and changing
the distribution of aquatic life. Luckily, in recent years, governments have
started to recognize the immense value of this natural resource. Partnerships between the United States and
Canada are underway to reduce pollution, protect coastal habitats, and halt the spread of invasive species. Protecting something as massive
as the Great Lakes system will require the collaboration
of many organizations, but the effort is critical if we can preserve the wonder
of this flowing inland sea.

having a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being
degraded and increasingly populated, exposing the once pristine waters to industrial, urban,
and agricultural pollutants. Because less than 1% of the water
leaves the Lake's system annually, decades-old pollutants still lurk
in its waters. Humans have also inadvertently introduced more than 100 non-native
and invasive species into the lakes, such as zebra and quagga mussels,
and sea lampreys that have decimated some indigenous
fish populations. On a larger scale, climate change
is causing the waters to warm, thus reducing water levels and changing
the distribution of aquatic life. Luckily, in recent years, governments have
started to recognize the immense value of this natural resource. Partnerships between the United States and
Canada are underway to reduce pollution, protect coastal habitats, and halt the spread of invasive species. Protecting something as massive
as the Great Lakes system will require the collaboration
of many organizations, but the effort is critical if we can preserve the wonder
of this flowing inland sea.

**Transcript**:
What's so great about the Great Lakes? They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive
that they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion
liters of water. That's enough to cover the land area
of the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over
3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique
geological feature come to be? The story begins near the end
of the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's
surface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out
a series of basins. Those basins filled with water
as the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area
of freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between
these basins, and water began to flow in
an ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,
the interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply
of fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in
the far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,
and clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths
of 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem
that includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average
200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan
or Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,
these two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes
by surface area. Water slowly moves through
its cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest
freshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,
which has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,
but heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow
southeastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest
and shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,
including millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop
by dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down
the thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake
by surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled
water enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes
bring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across
more than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking
water for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day
for the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is

**Transcript**:
Perfumers can learn to distinguish
individual odors in a fragrance made of hundreds of scents. Tea experts have been known to sniff out not just the location 
where a tea was from, but the season of harvest
and whether it was planted by a plum tree. And the New York City Transit Authority once had an employee responsible
only for sniffing out gas leaks in the subway system. Can just anyone learn to smell
with the sensitivity of those experts? For most of us, what we smell
is largely involuntary, whether it's garbage behind a restaurant, the shampoo of the woman leaving
an elevator as you enter, or a bakery's fresh-made bread. With a few million olfactory receptors
in our noses, we clearly don't lack the ability
to smell well. We just might not always pay close
enough attention. That's a shame because we may be
missing opportunities to make strong emotional connections. Smells are powerfully linked to emotions and can awaken memories of places
we've long ago left and people we've loved. But fortunately, it is possible
to train our brains to smell better. For example, Helen Keller was able
to recognize a person's work, and in her words, distinguish the carpenter
from the iron worker, the artist from the mason or the chemist, by a simple inhale. Follow these steps and you too can
change the way the world smells to you. First, stick your nose in it. Some animals that are known
to be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives and pigs who can 
find truffles underground, put their noses right at the place
they want to smell. Human noses, meanwhile, are casting
around in the middle of the air, giving us an anatomical disadvantage. So bring your nose close to the world
around you. The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand. Get close to your dog, your partner, the book you're reading. Not only will your nose be closer
to the odor source, but the warmth of your breath
will make odors easier to smell. Second, sniff like you mean it. Smelling actually happens way up near
the bridge of our noses in a postage stamp-sized square
of tissue called the olfactory epithelium. When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked
up into our nostrils until they hit this tissue where they combine to our olfactory,
or scent, receptors. When we inhale normally,
only a little air makes it there. But one or two solid sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to
your smell receptors. After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at
noticing new smells, turn off temporarily. So you can give your nose a rest
and sniff again later. Finally, dwell on the smell. Most smells pass by us 
with little attention, but simply noticing what you're smelling and by trying to describe it, name it,
and locate its source, you can expand your vocabulary of smells. When an odor molecule binds
to a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal
from the sensory neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs. The signal then continues to other
areas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste, memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell. FMRI research shows that the extra
time spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers. For them, perceiving and imagining odors
becomes more automatic than for non-experts. To get started yourself, take ingredients
from your kitchen: spices, vanilla, or fruit, but never anything toxic. Close your eyes and have someone
bring them under your nose. Sniff and try to name the source. Over time, you'll begin to appreciate
nuances in familiar odors and recognize characteristics of new
and unusual smells. The perfumer has practiced these steps
enough to become an artist of odor, but even if you never pursue smelling
to that degree, the spectacular result 
of an unspectacular action will change how you sense 
and experience your days.

**Transcript**:
Perfumers can learn to distinguish
individual odors in a fragrance made of hundreds of scents. Tea experts have been known to sniff out not just the location 
where a tea was from, but the season of harvest
and whether it was planted by a plum tree. And the New York City Transit Authority once had an employee responsible
only for sniffing out gas leaks in the subway system. Can just anyone learn to smell
with the sensitivity of those experts? For most of us, what we smell
is largely involuntary, whether it's garbage behind a restaurant, the shampoo of the woman leaving
an elevator as you enter, or a bakery's fresh-made bread. With a few million olfactory receptors
in our noses, we clearly don't lack the ability
to smell well. We just might not always pay close
enough attention. That's a shame because we may be
missing opportunities to make strong emotional connections. Smells are powerfully linked to emotions and can awaken memories of places
we've long ago left and people we've loved. But fortunately, it is possible
to train our brains to smell better. For example, Helen Keller was able
to recognize a person's work, and in her words, distinguish the carpenter
from the iron worker, the artist from the mason or the chemist, by a simple inhale. Follow these steps and you too can
change the way the world smells to you. First, stick your nose in it. Some animals that are known
to be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives and pigs who can 
find truffles underground, put their noses right at the place
they want to smell. Human noses, meanwhile, are casting
around in the middle of the air, giving us an anatomical disadvantage. So bring your nose close to the world
around you. The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand. Get close to your dog, your partner, the book you're reading. Not only will your nose be closer
to the odor source, but the warmth of your breath
will make odors easier to smell. Second, sniff like you mean it. Smelling actually happens way up near
the bridge of our noses in a postage stamp-sized square
of tissue called the olfactory epithelium. When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked
up into our nostrils until they hit this tissue where they combine to our olfactory,
or scent, receptors. When we inhale normally,
only a little air makes it there. But one or two solid sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to
your smell receptors. After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at
noticing new smells, turn off temporarily. So you can give your nose a rest
and sniff again later. Finally, dwell on the smell. Most smells pass by us 
with little attention, but simply noticing what you're smelling and by trying to describe it, name it,
and locate its source, you can expand your vocabulary of smells. When an odor molecule binds
to a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal
from the sensory neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs. The signal then continues to other
areas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste, memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell. FMRI research shows that the extra
time spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers. For them, perceiving and imagining odors
becomes more automatic than for non-experts. To get started yourself, take ingredients
from your kitchen: spices, vanilla, or fruit, but never anything toxic. Close your eyes and have someone
bring them under your nose. Sniff and try to name the source. Over time, you'll begin to appreciate
nuances in familiar odors and recognize characteristics of new
and unusual smells. The perfumer has practiced these steps
enough to become an artist of odor, but even if you never pursue smelling
to that degree, the spectacular result 
of an unspectacular action will change how you sense 
and experience your days.

**Transcript**:
If you look at cars from the 1970s and cars
from the 1990s, there’s really one big difference in their designs. The ones from the 70s are boxy, and the ones
from the 90s are curvy. For some car models, you can even tell the
exact year when that change happened. Just look at this commercial for the Buick
LeSabre, showing the 1991 model — and then the 1992 model. See the curves? Let’s watch that again. ‘91 is boxy, sharp edges. ‘92? Smooth and round. Since then, cars have become curvier and curvier. So how did this happen? When manufacturers started making curvy cars
in the 90s, it wasn’t a totally new concept. Back in the 1930s, streamliners like this Chrysler
Airflow used this sleek design to reduce wind resistance. But as the 50s and 60s rolled around, American
streamliners stopped selling well — they were outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Gas prices were on fairly steady decline at
this point, so streamlining for fuel efficiency was less of a concern. Well into the 1970s, just about every car
made in America had sharp edges and very few curves. They were basically designed as a series of
three boxes — the hood, the cabin, and the trunk. That model worked really well in the US market. But in Europe, fuel was always more expensive. In the 60s, a gallon of gas in France cost
a whopping 73.1 cents while it was just 31 cents in the US. So European designers started experimenting
with more aerodynamic designs to help cars move more easily so they’d waste less gas. Automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz
— they all started rolling out car models that had curved exteriors. Eventually American automakers started to
copy the European aerodynamic look to try to attract upscale consumers. The mass market was a different picture. In Europe, a designer named Uwe Bahnsen was
the first person to push for a curved design for the average driver, and he did that with
the 1982 Ford Sierra. It was curvier than any car in its class at
the time. But critics just laughed at it. And it didn't sell very well at first. It was nicknamed the “jelly mould” because
of how much it looked like the kind of circular shape you’d make JELL-O with. But one of the designers from that European
Ford design team — this guy, Jack Telnack — took over the US design team in 1980. American gas prices at this point were skyrocketing
due to conflict in the middle east. So Telnack brought wind tunnel testing into
the design process. He first did that with the 1983 Ford Thunderbird. But the real breakthrough came a few years
later: "The result was the groundbreaking 1986 Ford
Taurus." It might not look that groundbreaking now,
but this style was revolutionary at the time. It was a mass market car with curvy edges
— and people liked it. “Taurus! Now a North American car with a shape and
a feel we’ve never seen before… Taurus for us!” They used it in RoboCop as the car of the
future. The sales basically saved Ford, which had
really been struggling at the time, and it inspired a whole wave of copycat curvy cars. And streamlining became even more popular
because manufacturers were facing new fuel economy regulations in the US. Starting in 1978, the average fuel efficiency
of each manufacturer’s passenger cars had to meet higher and higher levels. According to one Ford designer, aerodynamic
design was a much more affordable way to boost efficiency than doing engineering work under
the hood. The rise of computer modelling in the 80s
also made it easier for car makers to design and manufacture curved lines. All these years later, the influence on today’s
cars is pretty clear. Even the models that we criticize for being
ridiculously boxy these days — like the Scion xB — are actually really round. And if our modern day sci fi movies have anything
to say about it, that won’t be changing anytime soon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: According to this video, what was the main reason cars went from being 'curvy' to 'boxy' in the early 1960s?
Options: A. curvy cars were considered 'un-American', B. America was in a race to land on the moon, and boxy cars were considered futuristic, C. fuel prices were dropping
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: Why did American streamliners stop selling well in the 1950s and 1960s?

a feel we’ve never seen before… Taurus for us!” They used it in RoboCop as the car of the
future. The sales basically saved Ford, which had
really been struggling at the time, and it inspired a whole wave of copycat curvy cars. And streamlining became even more popular
because manufacturers were facing new fuel economy regulations in the US. Starting in 1978, the average fuel efficiency
of each manufacturer’s passenger cars had to meet higher and higher levels. According to one Ford designer, aerodynamic
design was a much more affordable way to boost efficiency than doing engineering work under
the hood. The rise of computer modelling in the 80s
also made it easier for car makers to design and manufacture curved lines. All these years later, the influence on today’s
cars is pretty clear. Even the models that we criticize for being
ridiculously boxy these days — like the Scion xB — are actually really round. And if our modern day sci fi movies have anything
to say about it, that won’t be changing anytime soon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: During this boxy car period, certain curvy cars were manufactured in America, but they were marketed towards upscale clients. Why?

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Some of the world's most recognizable
symbols exist to sell products, others to steer traffic or advance political causes. But there's one whose main purpose
is to help people. You may know it as the wheelchair symbol,
or a sign for people with disabilities, but its formal title as maintained
by the ISO is the International Symbol of Access. But despite its familiarity, many people are unclear as to what 
the symbol actually means, which has a lot to do with the symbol
itself and the way it came about. In 1968, the International Commission
on Technology and Accessibility held a design contest. They were looking for a symbol that would be readily identifiable 
from a reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, practical, and couldn't be confused
with existing signage. The winning design, 
which didn't have a head, was created by a Danish designer
named Susanne Koefed. The addition of a head a year later
gave it a more human form, and within ten years, it was endorsed by both the United Nations
and the ISO. With minimal cost and minimal fuss,
a global icon was born. There have been a few tweaks
over the decades. The Graphic Artists Guild added more
rounded, human-like features, and in 2012, the Accessible Icon Project
produced a more dynamic version. But what does it really represent? What's its purpose? Put simply, it's a sign to identify where
there are accessible facilities. The strength of such an internationally
recognized image is that wherever you travel, you don't need to speak the language
or have in-depth cultural knowledge. If you require an accessible toilet,
the sign shows the way. But the confusion comes 
from the term accessibility and what that actually means. Many people assume that because
the symbol depicts a wheelchair, that accessible facilities are meant
only for people who use wheelchairs, or those, at the very least,
who have a visible physical condition. But accessibility is a broad concept that applies to many, 
many different conditions. That includes people with autism, visual impairments, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus, which can cause 
pain and fatigue, along with many other conditions. In fact, the World Health 
Organization estimates that there are approximately
1 billion people who experience some form of disability, which means that this group is very
likely to include yourself, or a family member, a classmate, a friend, or a work colleague. And people who use wheelchairs only
make up about 65 million, or 15% of the total. The vast majority 
have non-visible disabilities. Accessible parking spaces, facilities,
and entrances are designed with 
that entire group in mind. So it's easy to see why in recent years
people have begun to raise questions about whether the symbol is really
appropriate for what it's meant to do. And it's not just about accuracy. It's common for people 
to become indignant, sometimes abusive, when they see people without visible
disabilities using accessible facilities. The symbol is unfortunately creating
widespread issues for the very people and families
it's meant to help. The recent redesigns have attempted
with some success to acknowledge concerns 
over the current symbol. But some think that a complete redesign
is in order. It's a difficult task, though. How do you replace a symbol 
that's familiar the world over? And what do you replace it with?

1 billion people who experience some form of disability, which means that this group is very
likely to include yourself, or a family member, a classmate, a friend, or a work colleague. And people who use wheelchairs only
make up about 65 million, or 15% of the total. The vast majority 
have non-visible disabilities. Accessible parking spaces, facilities,
and entrances are designed with 
that entire group in mind. So it's easy to see why in recent years
people have begun to raise questions about whether the symbol is really
appropriate for what it's meant to do. And it's not just about accuracy. It's common for people 
to become indignant, sometimes abusive, when they see people without visible
disabilities using accessible facilities. The symbol is unfortunately creating
widespread issues for the very people and families
it's meant to help. The recent redesigns have attempted
with some success to acknowledge concerns 
over the current symbol. But some think that a complete redesign
is in order. It's a difficult task, though. How do you replace a symbol 
that's familiar the world over? And what do you replace it with?

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician, but ever since you criticized
the emperor's tax laws, you’ve been locked in the dungeon 
with only a marker to count the days. But one day you're suddenly brought
before the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted
of paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way 
into the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn 
your freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking
coins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very
slightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown 
back into the dungeon. You look around for
anything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room,
just the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin
against all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins
at the same time by splitting the stack 
into multiple piles, then narrowing down where
the false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins 
into three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale
gives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance, 
all eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among 
the remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results?
That’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic
coins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked
coin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus 
on the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier, 
or a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins
and weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins, 
the heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles
you way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side
with a plus and those on the lighter side 
with a minus. You can also mark the remaining four
coins with zeros, since you know the fake one 
is already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity
in just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need 
to reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three 
of the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those
with three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side 
of the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining 
plus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the 
lighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it 
against one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side 
became lighter, that means one of the three minus coins
you moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced
after your substitution, then one of the three plus coins 
you removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one. The emperor nods approvingly
at your finding, and the counterfeiting lord 
takes your place in the dungeon.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: If you know that among four otherwise identical coins one is heavier than the others, what is the minimum number of weighs you would need to uncover the single counterfeit coin?
Options: A. 1, B. 2, C. 3, D. 4
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the purpose of reassembling the piles after the first weighing?
Options: A. To remove all remaining ambiguity in just two more weighings., B. To find the counterfeit coin in one more weighing., C. To eliminate half of the coins., D. To start the process again.
Correct Option: None

**Transcript**:
You’re the realm’s greatest mathematician, but ever since you criticized
the emperor's tax laws, you’ve been locked in the dungeon 
with only a marker to count the days. But one day you're suddenly brought
before the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted
of paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way 
into the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn 
your freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking
coins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very
slightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown 
back into the dungeon. You look around for
anything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room,
just the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin
against all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins
at the same time by splitting the stack 
into multiple piles, then narrowing down where
the false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins 
into three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale
gives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance, 
all eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among 
the remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results?
That’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic
coins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them
against three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked
coin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus 
on the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier, 
or a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins
and weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins, 
the heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus,
it's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles
you way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side
with a plus and those on the lighter side 
with a minus. You can also mark the remaining four
coins with zeros, since you know the fake one 
is already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity
in just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need 
to reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three 
of the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those
with three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side 
of the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining 
plus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the 
lighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it 
against one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side 
became lighter, that means one of the three minus coins
you moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced
after your substitution, then one of the three plus coins 
you removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one. The emperor nods approvingly
at your finding, and the counterfeiting lord 
takes your place in the dungeon.

The sight of mistletoe may either send
you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas 
tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines 
the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of
mistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits 
that they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder 
described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England
believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven 
by the gods; that explained its unlikely position 
amongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers 
of healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told 
of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur
and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much 
that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow 
they’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, 
she overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized 
this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow 
carved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such
sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her 
and agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death
into one of peace and love. She mandated a one day
truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath 
its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists 
arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking
species of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales
of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition
from Europe into America. By the 18th century, people 
in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more 
than just human imagination. All of it was inspired
by the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,
but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark 
and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds 
and other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s 
sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed
onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage 
that stays lush even while the surrounding trees 
lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated
our superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s
magical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife
it supports. More than just a parasite, 
it’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,
including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, 
mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species
produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations
for a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic
relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts 
near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity 
and allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, 
that for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power 
to bring things together. And in our own traditions 
we see that happening too.

The sight of mistletoe may either send
you scurrying or if you have your eye on someone, awaiting an opportunity
beneath its snow white berries. But how did the festive Christmas 
tradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines 
the mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of
mistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans
were so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits 
that they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder 
described how the Druid priesthood in ancient England
believed that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven 
by the gods; that explained its unlikely position 
amongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers 
of healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told 
of the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur
and his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much 
that she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow 
they’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, 
she overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized 
this oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow 
carved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such
sadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her 
and agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became 
so overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death
into one of peace and love. She mandated a one day
truce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath 
its branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists 
arriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking
species of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales
of magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition
from Europe into America. By the 18th century, people 
in Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more 
than just human imagination. All of it was inspired
by the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,
but draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots
called haustoria that penetrate the tree bark 
and siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds 
and other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s 
sticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds
by wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed
onto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage 
that stays lush even while the surrounding trees 
lose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated
our superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s
magical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife
it supports. More than just a parasite, 
it’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,
including deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, 
mourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species
produce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations
for a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic
relationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts 
near mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity

**Transcript**:
Why can’t I just get on a plane and go from,
like, Montana to London, in a couple hours? I just want to experience the thrill of zooming
through the sky faster than the speed of sound? Well, if you flew on a Concorde jet back before
they were grounded -- or you happen to be a fighter pilot -- then you’ve probably
experienced faster-than-sound travel. And, some companies are looking to make supersonic
flight a reality again, with new commercial planes that travel faster than the speed of
sound. And someday, you might be able to fly over
the Atlantic Ocean in an hour -- or even less. Problem is, most people don’t want to fly
on a plane that feels like an out-of-control rocket. And there’s also the problem of faster-than-sound
planes becoming ridiculously hot and unbearably loud. So engineers have some developing to
do. On the morning of December 17th, 1903, Orville
Wright became the first human to successfully pilot an airplane -- a heavier-than-air vehicle
that was controlled, powered, and sustained. His flight lasted 12 seconds, and crossed
120 feet of a North Carolinian beach -- with an average speed of almost 11 kilometers an
hour. By the end of the day, his brother Wilbur
flew the same airplane for almost a whole minute, with an average speed of almost 16
kilometers an hour. Less than a century later, in the 1970s, commercial
planes went supersonic -- faster than the speed of sound. A few dozen supersonic planes were in regular
service, available in two models, the Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev. But the Tupolev only
made 55 passenger flights, from 1977 to 1978. And after a Concorde crashed in 2000, people
started to fly on them less. Eventually, they just weren’t financially
worth it anymore, and the planes were retired in 2003. 13 years later, there still aren’t any new
commercial faster-than-sound planes. But soon, there might be! There are just a
couple of improvements companies are trying to make first. The main challenge comes from getting past
what’s known as Mach 1. See, sound usually travels around 1230 kilometers
per hour, but that’s not a constant number -- it depends on things like the temperature
and humidity of the air. So, when it comes to planes, it’s easier
to talk about speed in Mach numbers, which take into account the speed of sound in the
particular place where the plane is flying.. Mach 1 is just the speed of sound. Anything
slower than that is called subsonic, and anything faster is called supersonic. But switching from subsonic to supersonic
isn’t easy, because the plane has to overcome the infamous sound barrier. And that can be a problem, because the sound
barrier is sometimes strong enough to tear away at planes, and even send them crashing
to the ground. The sound barrier exists because of the way
sound waves travel: by compressing and stretching the air they travel through. The compressed air ends up at a higher pressure,
and the stretched air has lower pressure. As a plane moves, it produces sound waves
that shift the air back and forth, creating areas of lower and higher pressure. But as the plane gets faster, it starts to
catch up with those waves. New sound waves start to form on top of the
old sound waves, causing huge swings between higher and lower pressure air. Those differences in pressure can rattle and
shake planes like toys, and there’s a real danger of tearing them to pieces. Low pressure areas can also lead to drops
in temperature, condensing any moisture in the air and forming a visible cloud, sometimes
known as a vapor cone. The first plane that could get past the sound
barrier was the Bell X-1, built in 1947. It was designed to absorb 18 times the force
of gravity, and modeled after a machine gun bullet. It didn’t actually lift off from the ground
on the zone, though -- it was dropped from a larger mothership plane, known as the B-29,
so it got a bit of a head start. By the mid-1970s, supersonic planes were ready
for commercial use -- with the UK and France designing the concorde, and the Soviet Union
designing the Tupolev. The Concorde flew passengers from London to
New York in about three and a half hours -- about half the time it would take in a plain old
subsonic commercial plane. But they only flew that one route, and there’s
a reason they spent as much time over the water as possible: the painfully disruptive
sonic boom. Like the sound barrier, sonic booms come from
a build-up of compressed sound waves, known as a shock wave. The shock wave heads away from the plane,
which you hear as a VERY loud boom -- so powerful that they’re sometimes mistaken for earthquakes. And those sonic booms don’t just happen
once, like when a plane breaks the sound barrier. They continue throughout the entire supersonic
flight. That’s because the sound waves keep bunching
up behind the plane, then expanding outwards, creating a cone shape known as the Mach cone. So wherever the plane flies over land, people
hear that incredibly loud boom. So that’s why the Concorde’s supersonic
commercial flights only really happened between western Europe and eastern North America. If they flew over land, odds are people would
not have appreciated the booms. And even though you can’t fly on a Concorde
anymore, you might still be able to fly on a supersonic plane someday. NASA, for example, is looking into how to
dampen the effects of the sonic boom. One way to do that might be by moving one,
or even two engines above the wings, which would direct shockwaves upwards. So the sonic
booms would happen in the sky, rather than on the ground. Then there’s the Concorde 2, which Airbus
is working on. The Concorde 2 would first fly directly upward,
to an altitude of about 30 kilometers. Then, the plane would rotate its tail fin
in a way that would redirect the shock waves to be horizontal, so you wouldn’t feel them
as much on the ground. The Concorde 2 would be able to accelerate
up to Mach 4.5 -- and at those speeds, it could take passengers from London to New York
in an hour. But maybe that’s not enough, what if you
want to go faster? The Concorde 2 would be very close to going
beyond supersonic, and into an even faster category, known as hypersonic. When people talk about hypersonic speeds,
they’re generally talking about Mach 5 or higher -- more than five times the speed of
sound. Those speeds get their own category, because
that’s when the temperature of the plane becomes a bigger issue. The plane is flying through the air so quickly
that friction with particles in the air is a real problem, because it makes a lot of
heat. At hypersonic speeds, planes need to be able
to withstand temperatures over 1000 degrees celsius… but almost all of the more typical
metals would melt, or at least become very weak, at temperatures below that. The other challenge is the engine, because
a regular jet engine wouldn’t work. Standard, subsonic planes use large rotating
blades to compress incoming air, inject fuel, and then let it burn. Propelling them forward. At supersonic speeds, it becomes even easier,
because the high speeds already compress the air. In that case, the engine doesn’t even need
the blades -- that’s what’s known as a ramjet engine. Ram, because the air is just rammed into the
engine. At hypersonic speeds, though, this plan doesn’t
work as well. Sure, the air is compressed, but it’s moving
so fast that there’s not enough time for it to combust and actually help move the plane. So hypersonic planes need their own fuel and
their own oxygen -- which is what NASA used in the X-15, the first plane to reach hypersonic
speeds. It used a titanium skin to protect itself
from the extreme temperatures, and was able to fly at Mach 6.72. It also flew high enough that some of the
X-15 test flights are considered space flights. But the X-15 is not the kind of plane that
could be used commercially. For one thing, it burned through fuel so fast that it would
run out in less than two minutes. Also, pilots sometimes experienced 8 times
the force of Earth’s gravity, and most people wouldn’t consider that a comfortable business
trip. So, until engines became more efficient and
practical, commercial hypersonic planes are a long way from reality. And the scramjet
might be the answer. Scramjet engines work kind of like ramjets
do, but they’re designed to handle the faster-moving air. In testing, NASA’s found that they could
work at speeds up to Mach 15, at least in theory. There’s one big drawback, though: scramjet
engines only work at hypersonic speeds. The X-43A, for example, an unmanned test plane
that uses a scramjet, has to be accelerated above Mach 5 before it can fly on its own. It’s strapped to a booster rocket, which
is then loaded onto a subsonic plane. Alright, stay with me... The plane flies up to about 6 kilometers above
the ground, then releases the X-43A, along with the rocket, which gets to about 30 kilometers
up and to speeds of Mach 5. Then the X-43A can start its flight. So, it might be a while before hypersonic
planes are a practical way to get across the Atlantic. But a future where a trip to the other side
of the world involves flying faster than the speed of sound, without painful sonic booms
for the people on the ground? That might not be so far off. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,

How high can you count on your fingers? It seems like a question 
with an obvious answer. After all, most of us have ten fingers, or to be more precise, eight fingers and two thumbs. This gives us a total of ten digits
on our two hands, which we use to count to ten. It's no coincidence that the ten symbols
we use in our modern numbering system are called digits as well. But that's not the only way to count. In some places, it's customary to
go up to twelve on just one hand. How? Well, each finger is divided 
into three sections, and we have a natural pointer
to indicate each one, the thumb. That gives us an easy to way to count
to twelve on one hand. And if we want to count higher, we can use the digits on our other hand to
keep track of each time we get to twelve, up to five groups of twelve, or 60. Better yet, let's use the sections
on the second hand to count twelve groups of twelve,
up to 144. That's a pretty big improvement, but we can go higher by finding more
countable parts on each hand. For example, each finger 
has three sections and three creases for a total of six things to count. Now we're up to 24 on each hand, and using our other hand to mark
groups of 24 gets us all the way to 576. Can we go any higher? It looks like we've reached the limit
of how many different finger parts we can count with any precision. So let's think of something different. One of our greatest 
mathematical inventions is the system of positional notation, where the placement of symbols allows
for different magnitudes of value, as in the number 999. Even though the same symbol is used
three times, each position indicates a different
order of magnitude. So we can use positional value on
our fingers to beat our previous record. Let's forget about finger sections
for a moment and look at the simplest case of having
just two options per finger, up and down. This won't allow us to represent 
powers of ten, but it's perfect for the counting system
that uses powers of two, otherwise known as binary. In binary, each position has double
the value of the previous one, so we can assign 
our fingers values of one, two, four, eight, all the way up to 512. And any positive integer,
up to a certain limit, can be expressed 
as a sum of these numbers. For example, the number seven
is 4+2+1. so we can represent it by having
just these three fingers raised. Meanwhile, 250 is 128+64+32+16+8+2. How high an we go now? That would be the number with all ten
fingers raised, or 1,023. Is it possible to go even higher? It depends on how dexterous you feel. If you can bend each finger just halfway,
that gives us three different states - down, half bent, and raised. Now, we can count using 
a base-three positional system, up to 59,048. And if you can bend your fingers
into four different states or more, you can get even higher. That limit is up to you,
and your own flexibility and ingenuity. Even with our fingers in just two
possible states, we're already working pretty efficiently. In fact, our computers are based
on the same principle. Each microchip consists of tiny
electrical switches that can be either on or off, meaning that base-two is the default way
they represent numbers. And just as we can use this system to
count past 1,000 using only our fingers, computers can perform billions 
of operations just by counting off 1's and 0's.

How high can you count on your fingers? It seems like a question 
with an obvious answer. After all, most of us have ten fingers, or to be more precise, eight fingers and two thumbs. This gives us a total of ten digits
on our two hands, which we use to count to ten. It's no coincidence that the ten symbols
we use in our modern numbering system are called digits as well. But that's not the only way to count. In some places, it's customary to
go up to twelve on just one hand. How? Well, each finger is divided 
into three sections, and we have a natural pointer
to indicate each one, the thumb. That gives us an easy to way to count
to twelve on one hand. And if we want to count higher, we can use the digits on our other hand to

**Transcript**:
If I want to turn this globe into a flat map, I’m going to have to cut it open. In order to get this to look anything like a rectangle. I've had to cut it in places. I've had to stretch it so that the countries look all wonky. And even still, it's almost impossible to get it to lie flat. And that right there is the eternal dilemma
of map makers: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form
of distortion. This guy proved that with math a long time
ago. Since around 1500s, mathematicians have set
about creating algorithms that would translate the globe into something flat. To do this, they use a process called projection. Popular rectangular maps use a cylindrical
projections. Imagine putting a theoretical cylinder over
the globe and projecting each point of the sphere onto the cylinder’s surface. Unroll the cylinder, and you have a flat,
rectangular map. But you could also project the globe onto
other objects, and how exactly a map maker projects the globe will affect what the map
looks like once it’s all flattened out. And here’s the big problem: Every one of
these projections comes with trade offs in shape, distance, direction and land area. Certain map projections can be either misleading
or very helpful depending on what you are using them for. Here’s an example. This map is called the Mercator projection. If you’re American, you probably studied
it in school. It’s the projection Google Maps uses. Mercator projection is popular for a couple
of reasons. First, it generally preserves the shape of
the countries. Brazil on the globe has the same shape as
Brazil on the Mercator projection. But the real purpose of the Mercator projection
was navigation -- it preserves direction, which is a big deal if you are trying to navigate
the ocean with only a compass. It was designed so that a line drawn between
two points on the map would provide the exact angle to follow on a compass to travel between
those points. If we go back into a globe, you can see that
this line is not shortest route. But it provides a simple, reliable way to
navigate across oceans. Gerardus Mercator, who created the projection
in the 16th century, was able to preserve direction by varying the distance between
latitude lines while also making them straight, creating a grid of right angles.. But that created other problems. Where mercator fails is its representation
of size. Look at the size of Africa as compared to
Greenland. On the mercator map they look about the same
size. But look at a globe for Greenland’s true
size, and you’ll see it’s way smaller than Africa. By a factor of 14 in fact. If we put some dot that are all the same size
on a globe, then we projected as a mercator map, we would end up with this. The circles retain their shape but are enlarged
the closer you get the poles. One modern critique is that this distortion
perpetuates imperialist attitudes of European domination over the southern hemisphere "The Mercator projection has fostered imperialist attitudes for centuries and created a ethnic bias against the third world." "Really?" If you want to see a map that more accurately
displays size, you can use the Gall-Peters projection, which is called an equal-area
map. Look at Greenland and Africa. The size comparison is now accurate. Much better than the mercator. but it’s obvious that the country shapes
are now stretched. Here are the dots again so you can see how
the projection preserves area while totally distorting shape. Something happened in the late 60s that would
change the whole purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections. Satellites orbiting our planet started sending
location and navigation data to little receiver units all over the world. This global positioning system wiped out the
need for paper maps as a means of navigating both the seas and the sky. Map projection choices became less about navigational
imperatives and more about aesthetics, design, and presentation. The mercator map, that vital tool of pre-GPS
navigation, was shunned by cartographers who now saw it as misleading. But most web mapping tools like Google maps
still use the mercator. According to Google this is because the Mercator’s
ability to preserve shape and angles makes close-up views of cities more accurate -- a
90 degree left turn on the map is a 90degree left turn on the street you’re driving down. But when trying to display something on a
world map, cartographers rarely use the mercator. Most modern cartographers have settled on
a variety of non-rectangular projections that split the difference between totally distorting
either size or shape. In 1998 The National Geographic Society adopted
The Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape

**Transcript**:
If I want to turn this globe into a flat map, I’m going to have to cut it open. In order to get this to look anything like a rectangle. I've had to cut it in places. I've had to stretch it so that the countries look all wonky. And even still, it's almost impossible to get it to lie flat. And that right there is the eternal dilemma
of map makers: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form
of distortion. This guy proved that with math a long time
ago. Since around 1500s, mathematicians have set
about creating algorithms that would translate the globe into something flat. To do this, they use a process called projection. Popular rectangular maps use a cylindrical
projections. Imagine putting a theoretical cylinder over
the globe and projecting each point of the sphere onto the cylinder’s surface. Unroll the cylinder, and you have a flat,
rectangular map. But you could also project the globe onto
other objects, and how exactly a map maker projects the globe will affect what the map
looks like once it’s all flattened out. And here’s the big problem: Every one of
these projections comes with trade offs in shape, distance, direction and land area. Certain map projections can be either misleading
or very helpful depending on what you are using them for. Here’s an example. This map is called the Mercator projection. If you’re American, you probably studied
it in school. It’s the projection Google Maps uses. Mercator projection is popular for a couple
of reasons. First, it generally preserves the shape of
the countries. Brazil on the globe has the same shape as
Brazil on the Mercator projection. But the real purpose of the Mercator projection
was navigation -- it preserves direction, which is a big deal if you are trying to navigate
the ocean with only a compass. It was designed so that a line drawn between
two points on the map would provide the exact angle to follow on a compass to travel between
those points. If we go back into a globe, you can see that
this line is not shortest route. But it provides a simple, reliable way to
navigate across oceans. Gerardus Mercator, who created the projection
in the 16th century, was able to preserve direction by varying the distance between
latitude lines while also making them straight, creating a grid of right angles.. But that created other problems. Where mercator fails is its representation
of size. Look at the size of Africa as compared to
Greenland. On the mercator map they look about the same
size. But look at a globe for Greenland’s true
size, and you’ll see it’s way smaller than Africa. By a factor of 14 in fact. If we put some dot that are all the same size
on a globe, then we projected as a mercator map, we would end up with this. The circles retain their shape but are enlarged
the closer you get the poles. One modern critique is that this distortion
perpetuates imperialist attitudes of European domination over the southern hemisphere "The Mercator projection has fostered imperialist attitudes for centuries and created a ethnic bias against the third world." "Really?" If you want to see a map that more accurately
displays size, you can use the Gall-Peters projection, which is called an equal-area
map. Look at Greenland and Africa. The size comparison is now accurate. Much better than the mercator. but it’s obvious that the country shapes
are now stretched. Here are the dots again so you can see how
the projection preserves area while totally distorting shape. Something happened in the late 60s that would
change the whole purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections. Satellites orbiting our planet started sending
location and navigation data to little receiver units all over the world. This global positioning system wiped out the
need for paper maps as a means of navigating both the seas and the sky. Map projection choices became less about navigational
imperatives and more about aesthetics, design, and presentation. The mercator map, that vital tool of pre-GPS
navigation, was shunned by cartographers who now saw it as misleading. But most web mapping tools like Google maps
still use the mercator. According to Google this is because the Mercator’s
ability to preserve shape and angles makes close-up views of cities more accurate -- a
90 degree left turn on the map is a 90degree left turn on the street you’re driving down. But when trying to display something on a
world map, cartographers rarely use the mercator. Most modern cartographers have settled on
a variety of non-rectangular projections that split the difference between totally distorting
either size or shape. In 1998 The National Geographic Society adopted
The Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape
accuracy. But the fact remains, that there is no one
right projection. cartographers and mathematicians have created
a huge library of available projections, each a new perspective on the planet. The best way to see what the earth really

The Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape
accuracy. But the fact remains, that there is no one
right projection. cartographers and mathematicians have created
a huge library of available projections, each a new perspective on the planet. The best way to see what the earth really
looks like is to look at a globe. But as long we use flat maps, we will deal
with the tradeoffs of projections, Just remember: there’s no right answer.

**Transcript**:
Nothing stuck to Mafia boss John Gotti who evaded justice for years by bribing
and threatening jurors and witnesses. That earned him the name
the Teflon Don after one of the slipperiest 
materials on Earth. Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo
crew wore for the moon landing, in pipes and valves used 
in the Manhattan Project, and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick
coating on frying pans and cookie sheets. So what is this slippery solid,
and why doesn't anything stick to it? Teflon is a brand name for
polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938
by a 27-year-old American chemist named Roy Plunkett while he was trying to develop 
a non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont, a chemicals company. The strange, white substance that formed
inside his lab canister was chemically inert, meaning it wouldn't react 
with other substances. It also had an extremely 
low coefficient of friction, making other materials slide right off it. Teflon's properties make it perfect
when you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof
of the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE
come from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of
repeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone 
of carbon atoms, each of which is attached 
to two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon
like armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine
is incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone
except each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces
that help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos
usually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached
to something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals 
to make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,
which acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret
guarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around 
800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into
a smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs
in this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein
molecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around 
without sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook
in a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,
like you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
it starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes
that can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast
over high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated 
well enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think 
that accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan
was bad for you, but the current consensus 
is that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other
chemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down
inside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon
is another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits 
worth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting
the environment for decades and exposing employees 
and local communities to health risks associated 
with a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved
in manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally 
convicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office
in New York City to announce, "The Teflon is gone. The don is covered in Velcro,
and all the charges stuck."

**Transcript**:
Nothing stuck to Mafia boss John Gotti who evaded justice for years by bribing
and threatening jurors and witnesses. That earned him the name
the Teflon Don after one of the slipperiest 
materials on Earth. Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo
crew wore for the moon landing, in pipes and valves used 
in the Manhattan Project, and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick
coating on frying pans and cookie sheets. So what is this slippery solid,
and why doesn't anything stick to it? Teflon is a brand name for
polytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938
by a 27-year-old American chemist named Roy Plunkett while he was trying to develop 
a non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont, a chemicals company. The strange, white substance that formed
inside his lab canister was chemically inert, meaning it wouldn't react 
with other substances. It also had an extremely 
low coefficient of friction, making other materials slide right off it. Teflon's properties make it perfect
when you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof
of the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE
come from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of
repeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone 
of carbon atoms, each of which is attached 
to two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon
like armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine
is incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone
except each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces
that help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos
usually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached
to something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals 
to make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,
which acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret
guarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around 
800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into
a smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs
in this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein
molecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around 
without sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook
in a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,
like you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,
it starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes
that can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast
over high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated 
well enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think 
that accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan
was bad for you, but the current consensus 
is that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other
chemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down
inside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon
is another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits 
worth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting
the environment for decades and exposing employees 
and local communities to health risks associated 
with a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved
in manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally 
convicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office
in New York City to announce, "The Teflon is gone. The don is covered in Velcro,
and all the charges stuck."

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] This episode is supported by Prudential [MUSIC] With more than 7 billion people on Earth and
one car for every six of us, traffic is bad just about everywhere. [HONKING] Last year, American drivers wasted nearly a million collective years staring at each
other’s tail-lights. The average driver in London has it the worst,
spending more than four days a year in gridlock. "There's Big Ben, kids! Parliament!" But Earth is home to another great commuter,
whose populations number in the trillions, and they don’t get stuck in traffic. An army ant’s day is a lot like ours. Set off in the morning alongside thousands
of our neighbors, moving out and back in neat little lines so we can provide for our brood… I mean family. Crowding, bottlenecks, slowpokes, ants face
the same traffic challenges we do. But they don’t get in traffic jams, which
is why scientists are looking to them for solutions to human traffic. In a perfect world cars could pack in bumper
to bumper and drive at that magic speed, but we’re not perfect. One wrong tap on the gas or brakes, and OH
COME ON! GET MOVING! When speed and density hit a tipping point,
jams are inevitable. Yet in the ant world, traffic jams don’t
happen, even when things get crowded. The easiest solution to an overcrowded road
is to make it bigger. But ants can’t just cut trails as wide as
they want. Wider roads take time and energy to maintain,
and the pheromones that mark them become weaker. Instead, ants get organized. It might not look like it, but there’s lanes
here. Ants headed back to the colony loaded up with
food use the center lane, while outbound ants stay to the edges. Why three lanes and not two, like our roads? When two ants are on a collision course, eventually
one’s gotta give. The loaded inbound ants are less maneuverable,
so the empty-handed ant almost always turns first, half the time to either side. And voila: three lanes, no crashes, no traffic
jams. If you think you’re so different from an
army ant, pay attention next time you’re in a busy crosswalk. We naturally form similar lanes in crowds,
mindless individuals contributing to a larger pattern. But put us behind the wheel, and this happens. [HONKING] There’s a simple reason we hate traffic. Because we hate waiting in line. Queueing up plays weird tricks on our brains’
sense of time. Occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied
time. This is why people listen to the radio, or
play that license plate game. And it’s the same reason supermarkets put
magazines in the checkout lines. Ever been late for a big meeting and felt
like the universe is standing in your way? Anxiety makes waits seem longer. Ever been in a traffic jam with no obvious
cause? The worst. Uncertain or unexplained waits are longer
than known or explained waits. But traffic engineers have learned that simple
information signs can change how we experience delays. But more than anything else, we hate unfair
waits. You see a sign that says “lane closed ahead”,
so you get over with plenty of time to spare, only to see some jerk zip past you and get
over at the last second. What… you can’t wait like the rest of
us, Mr. Hurrypants? Quick side note. Gonna let you in on a little secret. Traffic researchers have found that late merging
is actually better. If everyone drives up to the bottleneck and
goes one-by-one like a zipper, traffic moves up to 15% faster. We use both lanes at max capacity, no one
gets cheated, everyone wins! The more you know. And where were we? Oh yeah. Our innate sense of “what’s fair” leads
to the biggest psychological illusion that we experience on the road. Why does traffic always move faster in the
other lane? Well, spoilers first: It doesn’t. Let’s say two cars enter your standard stop-and-go
traffic jam side by side. Let’s count the time each one spends passing
versus getting passed. One driver zips past a few cars in the other
lane, only to stop and wait and watch other cars pass. And then go! WOO HOO! And then wait. Even if the two cars cross some invisible
finish line together, the same way they started, each driver will feel like they spent more
time being passed than passing, because they did. Our brains pay more attention to the losses
than the gains. All of this points to the real problem with
traffic. Our ego. Human drivers care about minimizing their
travel time and don’t give two honks about what other drivers want. Driving slower may be faster for everyone
else, but it’s not faster for me! I don’t care if we all get where we’re
going at the same time, I don’t like being passed! When leaf-cutter ants get stuck on a twig
behind a heavily-loaded slowpoke, do they honk and yell bad ant words? No! They simply slow down and march behind the
ant returning with the goods, because that’s what’s best for the group. Worker ants are all related and working toward
the same goal, the good of the colony. That’s the cooperative genetic programming
that underlies their awesome traffic systems. The fact that we have big, complicated brains
is the very reason that we get stuck in traffic and ants don’t. We think of traffic as something that happens
to us rather than admitting we are the problem. Ants are essentially tiny machines with simple
programming. Put them on a trail with a few rules, allow
individuals to communicate and interact with each other, and voila, you’ve got complex
traffic networks running at near-maximum efficiency. Sound familiar? It should! That’s basically what we’ll get when we
stop letting our egos drive and put traffic in the hands of a network of self-driving
cars optimized to serve the collective good. Sure, sentient machines may enslave humanity,
but at least they’ll cut down on our commute! But that’s a video for another day. Stay curious. Thanks to Prudential for sponsoring this episode. Saving a little more today, even just one
percent more of your annual income, can go a long way toward building a better retirement
tomorrow. Let's do a math equation. Say a 25 year-old that earns $40,000 a year
is planning on retiring at 70. if they save an additional 1% of their salary by deducting
$33 from their monthly paycheck and earn 6% compounding interest, they could increase

travel time and don’t give two honks about what other drivers want. Driving slower may be faster for everyone
else, but it’s not faster for me! I don’t care if we all get where we’re
going at the same time, I don’t like being passed! When leaf-cutter ants get stuck on a twig
behind a heavily-loaded slowpoke, do they honk and yell bad ant words? No! They simply slow down and march behind the
ant returning with the goods, because that’s what’s best for the group. Worker ants are all related and working toward
the same goal, the good of the colony. That’s the cooperative genetic programming
that underlies their awesome traffic systems. The fact that we have big, complicated brains
is the very reason that we get stuck in traffic and ants don’t. We think of traffic as something that happens
to us rather than admitting we are the problem. Ants are essentially tiny machines with simple
programming. Put them on a trail with a few rules, allow
individuals to communicate and interact with each other, and voila, you’ve got complex
traffic networks running at near-maximum efficiency. Sound familiar? It should! That’s basically what we’ll get when we
stop letting our egos drive and put traffic in the hands of a network of self-driving
cars optimized to serve the collective good. Sure, sentient machines may enslave humanity,
but at least they’ll cut down on our commute! But that’s a video for another day. Stay curious. Thanks to Prudential for sponsoring this episode. Saving a little more today, even just one

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine, for a second,
a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit 
around a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple. You probably haven't actually seen
any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because 
we're so used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually
a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination
inside your brain. That's because to create 
these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces 
and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made 
from fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands
of electrical signals getting them all to their destination
at precisely the right time. When you look at an object, thousands of neurons 
in your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode various 
characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow. This synchronous firing strengthens the
connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known
as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called
the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up,
assembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different
neuronal ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble 
associated with it, the neurons wired together
by that synchronized firing. But this principle doesn't explain
the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations
without ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin
balancing a pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, 
called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles 
for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects
as a single image. But something in your brain 
has to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate 
is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in 
all complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected
to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions
called neural fibers. The mental synthesis theory proposes
that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send
electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles
in the posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on
at the same time, you experience the composite image
just as if you'd actually seen it. This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles
by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis. In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both
neuronal ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away 
from the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers
at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length 
of the connections, but your brain, 
especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change 
the conduction velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty
substance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals 
zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have 
as many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 
100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this
difference in myelination could be the key 
to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, 
to our mental synthesis ability. A lot of this myelination 
happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot
to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies
throughout our lives.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the role of myelin in the brain?
Options: A. To speed up the transmission of signals between neurons, B. To reduce metabolic energy consumption by preventing ions from leaking from neuron, C. To increase the conduction velocity in longer fibers compared to shorter fibers in order to establish an uniform conduction time., D. All of the above
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is myelin, and what is its function?

Myelin is a protein that helps to create new neuronal ensembles., D. Myelin is a neurotransmitter that helps to coordinate the activation of multiple neuronal ensembles.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 24, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 7
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine, for a second,
a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit 
around a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple. You probably haven't actually seen
any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image
of something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because 
we're so used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually
a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination
inside your brain. That's because to create 
these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces 
and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made 
from fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands
of electrical signals getting them all to their destination
at precisely the right time. When you look at an object, thousands of neurons 
in your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode various 
characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow. This synchronous firing strengthens the
connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known
as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called
the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up,
assembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different
neuronal ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble 
associated with it, the neurons wired together
by that synchronized firing. But this principle doesn't explain
the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations
without ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin
balancing a pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, 
called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles 
for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects
as a single image. But something in your brain 
has to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate 
is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in 
all complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected
to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions
called neural fibers. The mental synthesis theory proposes
that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send
electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles
in the posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on
at the same time, you experience the composite image
just as if you'd actually seen it. This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles
by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis. In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both
neuronal ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away 
from the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers
at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length 
of the connections, but your brain, 
especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change 
the conduction velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty
substance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals 
zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have 
as many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 
100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this
difference in myelination could be the key 
to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, 
to our mental synthesis ability. A lot of this myelination 
happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot
to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies
throughout our lives.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the role of myelin in the brain?
Options: A. To speed up the transmission of signals between neurons, B. To reduce metabolic energy consumption by preventing ions from leaking from neuron, C.
