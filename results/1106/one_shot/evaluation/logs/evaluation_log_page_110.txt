Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Question 2 describes the relation between the launch codes given to Minion A and Minion B, which includes the information that the sum was given to Minion A and the product to Minion B.

However, to make Question 2 more similar to the ground truth MCQ, the options and the question itself would need to be modified to focus on what type of number was provided to Minion A.

Here's an example of how Question 2 could be modified:

Question: What type of number was provided to Minion A?
Options: A. The product of the positive integers., B. The sum of the positive integers., C. Both the sum and the product of the positive integers., D. Neither the sum nor the product of the positive integers.

In its current form, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, with an index of 2.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 3: What was the conclusion drawn by Minion A from Minion B's statement "I know your number, and now I know you know my number too"?**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the clue Minion B provides.

A closer match would be a generated MCQ that asks: "What clue does Minion B provide?" or "What information does Minion B convey to Minion A?" Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 3**

However, I would like to note that this is not an exact match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the clue Minion B provides.

If you would like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that more closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Options: A. That there was a guarantee that Minion B's number was on Minion A's list., B. That there was no guarantee that Minion B's number was on Minion A's list., C. That Minion A's number was always greater than Minion B's number., D. That Minion B's number was always greater than Minion A's number.

Although this question does not directly ask how Minion B could know Minion A's number, it touches on the idea of considering the possibilities and the ambiguity of the situation, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest creating a new question based on the content of the transcript. A possible generated MCQ could be:

Question: How could Minion B determine Minion A's number?
Options: A. Only if there is exactly one valid way to factor Minion B's number., B. Only if there are multiple ways to factor Minion B's number., C. Only if Minion B knows the sum of the numbers., D. Only if Minion B knows the product of the numbers.

This new question is more directly related to the ground truth MCQ and captures the essence of the puzzle.

Since the original generated MCQs do not have a direct match, I will provide the index of the closest match, which is Question 6.

Index: 6

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the most similar generated MCQ would be Question 5: What happened to Karen Keegan's embryo during her mother's pregnancy?

This question is related to Karen Keegan's situation, but it doesn't directly address the relationship between Karen Keegan and her sons. However, it provides some context about how she acquired the second genome, which is relevant to understanding why she is her children's biological aunt.

If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 5 is the most similar, but I would like to note that it's not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a common sign of the condition (chimerism), and the correct answer is "Deafness" as the option that is NOT a common sign. 

Although there isn't a direct match, Question 1 is the closest in terms of discussing physical characteristics associated with chimerism. However, it does not ask about what is NOT a common sign.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the intent of asking about physical characteristics or signs of chimerism, I would suggest:

 Question 1: What is chimerism? Options: A. A condition where an individual has two different eye colors., B. A condition where an individual has two different sets of genes in their body., C. A condition where an individual has two different skin tones., D. A condition where an individual has two different hair colors.

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not exactly replicate the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US 
were all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light
to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about areas that scientists found to be particularly bright with fluorescence. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask this question, Question 1 mentions the discovery of a wavelength of unknown origin that showed the planet covered in a red hue, which is related to the concept of fluorescence.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, I would suggest Question 1, but with the caveat that it does not directly ask about areas with high fluorescence.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose, I would say:

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US 
were all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light
to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
Smuggling yourself aboard the rogue
submarine was the easy part. Hacking into the nuclear missile launch
override— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: 
you don’t have the override code. You know you need 
the same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used
to authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, 
you’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion 
with the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, 
the other to minion B, and forbade them to share 
the numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number 
and activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left
before the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— 
your launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive
integers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum
to you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,
A says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know
you know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter 
to override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.
Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are
notoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself 
in the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities 
based on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably
have something with the potential to reveal A’s number,
but isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, 
but it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know
A’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way 
to factor B’s number. Try factoring a few 
and you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product
must be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 
and the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it 
into 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers 
must be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities
only has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,
A’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,
because if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B 
already knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become 
sums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of 
the most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember 
is that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities 
from A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through
unintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums
can result from its factors, then break those apart 
and see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar 
going from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— 
when A made his first statement, he must have been holding
either 5 or 6. B has access to the same information 
we do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each
brain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,
but only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part 
of B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have
either 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make
the product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken 
down three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,
but 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know
whether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option 
because it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4
could be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A 
would be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,
so B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether
B had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half 
of what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override 
the missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub 
to the bottom of the ocean.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have 
two-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible
signs of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,
from a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus 
and a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells 
in the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able 
to develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system 
is suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells 
with the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body 
for years or even decades without being destroyed
by her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,
and found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her
liver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired 
her second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy
with her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some 
fetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus 
developed an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized
both genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells
with the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was
composed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,
and even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all
with the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue
in her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be 
no way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children
ended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing 
determined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%
of the father’s sperm carried a second genome 
from an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge 
our perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases
of chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic
codes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births
started out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people
with two genomes— and many more lessons to learn
about the genes that make us who we are.

**Transcript**:
While searching for a kidney donor, a Boston woman named Karen Keegan 
stumbled upon a mystery. When her three adult sons
underwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match
for kidney donation, the test showed that two of them
weren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, 
her doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something 
even more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second 
genome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had 
a completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged 
to her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, 
where an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam
of three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have

**Transcript**:
In 2009, a satellite circled Earth, methodically scanning and sorting
the wavelengths reflecting off the planet’s surface. Researchers were looking for the spectral 
signature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength
of unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth 
with only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered 
in a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never 
escapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond 
with densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating 
from places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, 
northern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US 
were all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light
to grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three
ways that light entering a photosynthetic organism 
is used. And this is the key to solving 
the mystery. To understand the others, 
we need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s 
cells called chloroplasts, which are packed 
with chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, 
some of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy 
into chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon 
dioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates
an important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried 
out by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light
than they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't
photosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed
to a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can
damage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light
is by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact 
with incoming light is by radiating it back out 
at a different wavelength, producing what’s called 
chlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, 
the chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series
of chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons
fall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light 
absorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red
end of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you
can’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing
as they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused 
the Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, 
but a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence 
from space allows us to watch the planet breathe
in real time— and monitor the health 
of ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels
of greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors 
or lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically
indicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence 
is a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much
oxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed 
in a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence 
may also occur before visible signs of plant stress,
making it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll
fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.

fluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought 
in the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating 
photosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support 
our silent friends, who already do so much for us.
